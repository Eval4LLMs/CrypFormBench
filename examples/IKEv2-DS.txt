The given HLPSL code models the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol, specifically focusing on a variant that uses digital signatures for authentication, which is referred to as IKEv2-DS. Here's a detailed description of the protocol as modeled in the code:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nIKEv2 is designed to perform mutual authentication and establish a shared cryptographic key between two parties, known in this context as Alice (A) and Bob (B), before setting up an IPsec secure connection. The variant analyzed here uses digital signatures for authentication.\n\n### Protocol Phases\n\nThe protocol consists of two main exchanges:\n\n1. **IKE_SA_INIT**:\n   - In this phase, Alice and Bob exchange nonces and perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish an initial security association, known as IKE_SA.\n\n2. **IKE_SA_AUTH**:\n   - This phase authenticates the first phase messages, exchanges user identities, and establishes the first \"child security association\" (CHILD_SA) which will be used to secure the subsequent IPsec tunnel.\n\n### Exchange Details\n\n- **IKE_SA_INIT**\n  1. Alice generates a nonce (`Na`) and a Diffie-Hellman half-key (`KEa`), then sends a cryptosuite offer (`SAa1`) to Bob.\n  2. Bob responds with his preferred cryptosuite (`SAb1`), his Diffie-Hellman half-key (`KEb`), and his nonce (`Nb`).\n\n- **IKE_SA_AUTH**\n  3. Alice sends her identity, an authentication value (`AUTHa`), and a new cryptosuite offer (`SAa2`), all encrypted with a key derived from the exchanged nonces and Diffie-Hellman values.\n  4. Bob replies with his identity, an authentication value (`AUTHb`), and his preferred cryptosuite (`SAb2`), also encrypted with the previously derived key.\n\n### Modeling Assumptions\n\n- Cryptographic negotiation is abstracted such that Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s cryptosuite offers are assumed equal (SAa1 = SAb1 and SAa2 = SAb2).\n- Certain aspects of IKEv2, such as identity hiding and public-key certificate exchanges, are omitted for simplification.\n- The model assumes a network where messages can be intercepted and possibly altered by an intruder.\n\n### Intruder Model and Attack Scenario\n\nThe model includes an intruder capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack, relaying messages between Alice and Bob without their awareness. The attack illustrated in the protocol trace shows that the intruder could convince Bob that he is communicating directly with Alice, even though Alice and Bob are not participating in the same session.\n\n### Security Goals\n\nThe protocol aims to ensure:\n\n- **Secrecy** of session keys (`sec_a_SK` and `sec_b_SK`).\n- **Authentication**: Alice authenticates Bob on `sk1`, and Bob authenticates Alice on `sk2`.\n\nThese goals are classified under specific security goals addressed by IKEv2, such as mutual authentication and key secrecy. However, the model identifies potential vulnerabilities, such as lacking key confirmation, which could be mitigated by extending the protocol to include additional checks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe HLPSL model of IKEv2-DS captures the essential mechanisms of mutual authentication and key establishment using digital signatures. It demonstrates how these processes can be vulnerable to certain attacks and highlights areas where the protocol could be strengthened, particularly regarding key confirmation to prevent replay or man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive understanding of the IKEv2-DS protocol as modeled in the provided HLPSL code, detailing the protocol's structure, assumptions, potential vulnerabilities, and security goals.


%% PROTOCOL: IKEv2: Internet Key Exchange, version 2\n%% VARIANT: authentication based on digital signatures\n%% PURPOSE:\n%% IKE is designed to perform mutual authentication and key\n%% exchange prior to setting up an IPsec connection.\n%%\n%% IKEv2 exists in several variants, the defining difference\n%% being the authentication method used.  \n%%\n%% This variant, which we call IKEv2-DS, uses digital signatures.\n%%\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\cite{ipsec-ikev2}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%% \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\item Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% IKEv2-DS proceeds in two so-called exchanges.  In the first,\n%% called IKE\\_SA\\_INIT, the users exchange nonces and perform \n%% a Diffie-Hellman exchange, establishing an initial security \n%% association called the IKE\\_SA.  The second exchange,\n%% IKE\\_SA\\_AUTH, then authenticates the previous messages,\n%% exchanges the user identities, and establishes the first \n%% so-called \"child security association\" or CHILD\\_SA which will\n%% be used to secure the subsequent IPsec tunnel.\n%% A (respectively B) generates a nonce Na and a Diffie-Hellman \n%% half key KEa (respectively KEb).  In addition, SAa1 contains A's \n%% cryptosuite offers and SAb1 B's preference for the establishment\n%% of the IKE\\_SA.  Similarly SAa2 and SAb2 for the establishment of \n%% the CHILD\\_SA.\n%%\\begin{verbatim}\n%% IKE_SA_INIT\n%% 1. A -> B: SAa1, KEa, Na\n%% 2. B -> A: SAb1, KEb, Nb\n%% IKE_SA_AUTH\n%% 3.

B -> A: {B, AUTHb, SAb2}K\n%%    where \n%%      AUTHb = {SAb1.g^KEb.Na.Nb}inv(Kb)\n%%\\end{verbatim}\n%% Note that because we abstract away from the negotiation of \n%% cryptographic algorithms, we have SAa1 = SAb1 and \n%% SAa2 = SAb2.  \n%%\n%% LIMITATIONS:\n%%\n%%Issues abstracted from:\n%%\\begin{itemize}\n%%\\item The parties, Alice and Bob, should negotiate mutually \n%% acceptable cryptographic algorithms.  This we abstract by\n%% modelling that Alice sends only a single offer for a crypto-suite,\n%% and Bob must accept this offer.  We thus assume that goal G11\n%% is fulfilled.\n%%\\item There are goals of IKEv2 which we do not yet consider.  For\n%% instance, identity hiding.\n%%\\item IKEv2-DS includes provisions for the optional exchange\n%% of public-key certificates.  This is not included in our model.\n%%\\item We do not model the exchange of traffic selectors, which\n%% are specific to the IP network model and would be meaningless\n%% in our abstract communication model.\n%%\\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% PROBLEMS: 3\n%% CLASSIFICATION: G1, G2, G3, G7, G9, G10, G11\n%% ATTACKS: \n%% With this variant of IKEv2, we find an attack analogous\n%% to the one that Meadows reports on in~\\cite{Meadows:ike}.  In\n%% essence, the intruder is able to mount a man-in-the-middle attack\n%% between agents $a$ and $b$.  The trace below illustrates how the intruder\n%% convinces $b$ that he was talking with $a$, when in fact $a$ has not \n%% participated in the same session.  Rather, the intruder has merely\n%% relayed messages from a different session with $a$, a session in which\n%% $a$ expects to talk to the intruder.\\\\\n%% \\verb!i -> (a,6): start!\\\\\n%% \\verb!(a,6) -> i: SA1(1),exp(g,DHX(1)),Ni(1)!\\\\\n%% \\verb!i -> (b,3): SA1(1),exp(g,DHX(1)),Ni(1)!\\\\\n%% \\verb!(b,3) -> i: SA1(1),exp(g,DHY(2)),Nr(2)!\\\\\n%% \\verb!i -> (a,6): SA1(1),exp(g,DHY(2)),Nr(2)!\\\\\n%% \\verb!(a,6) -> i: {a,{SA1(1),exp(g,DHX(1)),Ni(1),Nr(2)}inv(ka),!\\\\\n%% \\verb!                SA2(3)}(f(Ni(1),Nr(2),SA1(1),exp(exp(g,DHY(2)),DHX(1))))!\\\\\n%% \\verb!i -> (b,3): {a,{SA1(1),exp(g,DHX(1)),Ni(1),Nr(2)}inv(ka),!\\\\\n%% \\verb!                SA2(3)}(f(Ni(1),Nr(2),SA1(1),exp(exp(g,DHY(2)),DHY(2))))!\\\\\n%% \\verb!(b,3) -> i: {b,{SA1(1),exp(g,DHY(2)),Nr(2),Ni(1)}inv(kb),!\\\\\n%% \\verb!                SA2(3)}(f(Ni(1),Nr(2),SA1(1),exp(exp(g,DHX(1)),DHY(2))))!\\\\\n%%\n%% This attack is of questionable validity, as the intruder has not actually  \n%% learned the key that $b$ believes to have established with $a$.  Thus,\n%% the intruder cannot exploit the authentication flaw to further\n%% purposes.  The attack can be precluded if we add key confirmation\n%% to the protocol.  That is, if we extend the protocol to include\n%% messages in which the exchanged key is actually used, then\n%% this attack is no longer possible.  In specification IKEv2-DSX\n%% we do just this.\n%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \t\n%%HLPSL:\nrole alice(A,B:agent,\n\t   G: text,\n\t   F: hash_func,\n\t   Ka,Kb: public_key,\n\t   SND_B, RCV_B: channel (dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n\n  local Ni, SA1, SA2, DHX: text, \n\tNr: text,\n\tKEr: message, %% more specific: exp(text,text)\n\tSK: hash(text.text.text.message),\n\tState: nat\n\n  const sec_a_SK : protocol_id\n\n  init  State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n  %% The IKE_SA_INIT exchange:\n  %% We have abstracted away from the negotiation of cryptographic\n  %% parameters.
