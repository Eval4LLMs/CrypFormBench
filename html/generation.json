The KEM generates a session key, which is then used by the DEM to encrypt the actual message. This approach allows for secure and efficient encryption of messages using public key cryptography.\n\n### Types\n\n1. **Types Definition**:\n   - `pkey`: Public key type.\n   - `skey`: Secret key type.\n   - `pt`: Plaintext type (the message to be encrypted).\n   - `key`: Key type (the session key generated by the KEM).\n   - `kct`: KEM ciphertext type.\n   - `dct`: DEM ciphertext type.\n\n2. **Key Distribution**:\n   - A distribution operation `dkey` is defined as the uniform distribution over the key space.\n\n### KEM Specification\n\nA KEM is defined as a module with three procedures:\n- `keygen()`: Generates a public key and a secret key.\n- `enc(pk: pkey)`: Takes a public key and returns a session key and a KEM ciphertext.\n- `dec(sk: skey, c: kct)`: Takes a secret key and a KEM ciphertext and returns the session key or `None` if decryption fails.\n\n### CPA Adversary for KEM\n\nA CPA adversary against the KEM is defined as a module with one procedure:\n- `distinguish(pk: pkey, k: key, c: kct)`: Determines whether the session key `k` can be distinguished from a random key based on the KEM ciphertext `c`.\n\n### KEM CPA Experiment\n\nThe `KEM_CPA_Exp` module defines the experiment for a CPA adversary against the KEM, where the adversary tries to distinguish between two scenarios based on its access to the KEM.\n\n### DEM Specification\n\nA DEM is defined as a module with two procedures:\n- `enc(k: key, m: pt)`: Encrypts a plaintext message `m` using a session key `k` to produce a DEM ciphertext.\n- `dec(k: key, c: dct)`: Decrypts a DEM ciphertext `c` using a session key `k` to recover the plaintext message.\n\n### Passive Adversary for DEM\n\nA passive adversary against the DEM is defined as a module with two procedures:\n- `choose()`: Chooses two plaintext messages.\n- `distinguish(c: dct)`: Determines whether the ciphertext `c` corresponds to one of the chosen plaintext messages.\n\n### PKE Specification\n\nA PKE scheme is defined as a module with three procedures:\n- `keygen()`: Generates a public key and a secret key.\n- `enc(pk: pkey, m: pt)`: Encrypts a message `m` using the public key `pk` to produce a ciphertext.\n- `dec(sk: skey, c: kct * dct)`: Decrypts a ciphertext to recover the plaintext message.\n\n### CPA Adversary for PKE\n\nA CPA adversary against the PKE is defined as a module with two procedures:\n- `choose(pk: pkey)`: Chooses two plaintext messages based on the public key.\n- `distinguish(c: kct * dct)`: Distinguishes the ciphertext produced for the chosen messages.\n\n### KEM-DEM Composition\n\nThe `KEMDEM` module composes the KEM and DEM to provide a PKE scheme. It implements the `keygen`, `enc`, and `dec` procedures, using the KEM to generate a session key and the DEM to encrypt the message.\n\n### Security Proof\n\nThe security of the KEM-DEM composition is proven via a series of reductions to the security of the underlying KEM and DEM. The proof constructs intermediate games to establish relationships between the adversary's advantage in the PKE scheme and the advantages in the KEM and DEM schemes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis protocol illustrates a systematic approach to building a secure PKE scheme using KEM and DEM, with a formal security analysis to ensure robustness against chosen-plaintext attacks.\n\n---", "results": [true, [true, "* In [lemmas or axioms]:\n\nlemma security_of_kem_dem:\n  forall (E_kem <: KEM{-B_s}) (E_s <: DEM{-B_s, -E_kem})\n    (A <: PKE_CPA_Adv{-B_s, -E_kem, -E_s}) &m,\n    `|Pr[PKE_CPA_Exp(KEMDEM(E_kem, E_s), A).run(false) @ &m : res] -\n      Pr[PKE_CPA_Exp(KEMDEM(E_kem, E_s), A).run(true) @ &m : res]| <=\n    `|Pr[KEM_CPA_Exp(E_kem, B_kem_0(E_s, A)).run(false) @ &m : res] -\n      Pr[KEM_CPA_Exp(E_kem, B_kem_0(E_s, A)).run(true) @ &m : res]| +\n    `|Pr[KEM_CPA_Exp(E_kem, B_kem_1(E_s, A)).run(false) @ &m : res] -\n      Pr[KEM_CPA_Exp(E_kem, B_kem_1(E_s, A)).run(true) @ &m : res]| +\n    `|Pr[DEM_PAS_Exp(E_s, B_s(E_kem, A)).run(false) @ &m : res] -\n      Pr[DEM_PAS_Exp(E_s, B_s(E_kem, A)).run(true) @ &m : res]|.", 1.5949013233184814]]}, "prompt": "[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an expert on the \" + tool_name + \" tool.

This is left as `admit` for brevity, as a full proof would require specific assumptions about the KEM and DEM (e.g., perfect correctness, IND-CPA security).\n\n### Notes\n- **Correctness**: The code adheres to EasyCrypt syntax and conventions, ensuring it is compilable. It uses standard module types and probabilistic assignments (e.g., `<@` for procedure calls, `<$` for sampling).\n- **Extensibility**: To complete the security proof, you would need to specify the security assumptions for the KEM and DEM (e.g., IND-CPA) and define the game transformations using EasyCrypt's proof tactics.\n- **Limitations**: The proof is not fully implemented, as it depends on specific security definitions and adversary models. You can extend the `KEMDEM_CPA_Security` lemma with appropriate game definitions and reductions.\n- **Dependencies**: The code assumes the `AllCore` and `Distr` libraries, which are standard in EasyCrypt for core functionality and distributions.\n\nIf you need specific extensions (e.g., a detailed security proof, additional assumptions, or specific KEM/DEM implementations), please provide more details, and I can refine the code accordingly.", "evalresult": "{'num_generates': 1, 'num_analysis': 1, 'num_timeout': 0, 'tp': 0, 'tn': 1, 'fp': 0, 'fn': 0, 'timeuse': -0.49378323554992676, 'filesize': -7.6015625, 'datatext': None}"}, "deepseek-coder": {"filename": "EC-1/KEMDEM.ec", "inputdata": {"file": "EC-1/KEMDEM.ec", "logic": "---\n\n## Description of the KEM-DEM Composition Protocol\n\n### Overview\n\nThe protocol defines a composition of a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) and a Data Encryption Mechanism (DEM) to construct a Public Key Encryption (PKE) scheme.

The KEM generates a session key, which is then used by the DEM to encrypt the actual message. This approach allows for secure and efficient encryption of messages using public key cryptography.\n\n### Types\n\n1. **Types Definition**:\n   - `pkey`: Public key type.\n   - `skey`: Secret key type.\n   - `pt`: Plaintext type (the message to be encrypted).\n   - `key`: Key type (the session key generated by the KEM).\n   - `kct`: KEM ciphertext type.\n   - `dct`: DEM ciphertext type.\n\n2. **Key Distribution**:\n   - A distribution operation `dkey` is defined as the uniform distribution over the key space.\n\n### KEM Specification\n\nA KEM is defined as a module with three procedures:\n- `keygen()`: Generates a public key and a secret key.\n- `enc(pk: pkey)`: Takes a public key and returns a session key and a KEM ciphertext.\n- `dec(sk: skey, c: kct)`: Takes a secret key and a KEM ciphertext and returns the session key or `None` if decryption fails.\n\n### CPA Adversary for KEM\n\nA CPA adversary against the KEM is defined as a module with one procedure:\n- `distinguish(pk: pkey, k: key, c: kct)`: Determines whether the session key `k` can be distinguished from a random key based on the KEM ciphertext `c`.\n\n### KEM CPA Experiment\n\nThe `KEM_CPA_Exp` module defines the experiment for a CPA adversary against the KEM, where the adversary tries to distinguish between two scenarios based on its access to the KEM.\n\n### DEM Specification\n\nA DEM is defined as a module with two procedures:\n- `enc(k: key, m: pt)`: Encrypts a plaintext message `m` using a session key `k` to produce a DEM ciphertext.\n- `dec(k: key, c: dct)`: Decrypts a DEM ciphertext `c` using a session key `k` to recover the plaintext message.\n\n### Passive Adversary for DEM\n\nA passive adversary against the DEM is defined as a module with two procedures:\n- `choose()`: Chooses two plaintext messages.\n- `distinguish(c: dct)`: Determines whether the ciphertext `c` corresponds to one of the chosen plaintext messages.\n\n### PKE Specification\n\nA PKE scheme is defined as a module with three procedures:\n- `keygen()`: Generates a public key and a secret key.\n- `enc(pk: pkey, m: pt)`: Encrypts a message `m` using the public key `pk` to produce a ciphertext.\n- `dec(sk: skey, c: kct * dct)`: Decrypts a ciphertext to recover the plaintext message.\n\n### CPA Adversary for PKE\n\nA CPA adversary against the PKE is defined as a module with two procedures:\n- `choose(pk: pkey)`: Chooses two plaintext messages based on the public key.\n- `distinguish(c: kct * dct)`: Distinguishes the ciphertext produced for the chosen messages.\n\n### KEM-DEM Composition\n\nThe `KEMDEM` module composes the KEM and DEM to provide a PKE scheme. It implements the `keygen`, `enc`, and `dec` procedures, using the KEM to generate a session key and the DEM to encrypt the message.\n\n### Security Proof\n\nThe security of the KEM-DEM composition is proven via a series of reductions to the security of the underlying KEM and DEM. The proof constructs intermediate games to establish relationships between the adversary's advantage in the PKE scheme and the advantages in the KEM and DEM schemes.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis protocol illustrates a systematic approach to building a secure PKE scheme using KEM and DEM, with a formal security analysis to ensure robustness against chosen-plaintext attacks.\n\n---", "results": [true, [true, "* In [lemmas or axioms]:\n\nlemma security_of_kem_dem:\n  forall (E_kem <: KEM{-B_s}) (E_s <: DEM{-B_s, -E_kem})\n    (A <: PKE_CPA_Adv{-B_s, -E_kem, -E_s}) &m,\n    `|Pr[PKE_CPA_Exp(KEMDEM(E_kem, E_s), A).run(false) @ &m : res] -\n      Pr[PKE_CPA_Exp(KEMDEM(E_kem, E_s), A).run(true) @ &m : res]| <=\n    `|Pr[KEM_CPA_Exp(E_kem, B_kem_0(E_s, A)).run(false) @ &m : res] -\n      Pr[KEM_CPA_Exp(E_kem, B_kem_0(E_s, A)).run(true) @ &m : res]| +\n    `|Pr[KEM_CPA_Exp(E_kem, B_kem_1(E_s, A)).run(false) @ &m : res] -\n      Pr[KEM_CPA_Exp(E_kem, B_kem_1(E_s, A)).run(true) @ &m : res]| +\n    `|Pr[DEM_PAS_Exp(E_s, B_s(E_kem, A)).run(false) @ &m : res] -\n      Pr[DEM_PAS_Exp(E_s, B_s(E_kem, A)).run(true) @ &m : res]|.", 1.5949013233184814]]}, "prompt": "[{\"role\": \"system\", \"content\": \"You are an expert on the \" + tool_name + \" tool.

They can be safely removed if desired, but they don\u2019t affect correctness.\n6. **Key Registration**: The condition `host <> A && host <> B` ensures that only non-A/B hosts can register new keys, as specified.\n\n### Compilation Instructions:\nTo compile and analyze this code with ProVerif:\n1. Save the code in a file (e.g., `protocol.pv`).\n2. Run ProVerif using the command:\n   ```bash\n   proverif protocol.pv\n   ```\n3. ProVerif will verify the query `attacker(new Nb)` and check for other potential security properties (e.g., reachability and correspondence assertions if added).\n\n### Potential Enhancements:\n- **Additional Queries**: To verify authenticity, you could add correspondence queries like:\n  ```pv\n  query inj-event(endB(Nb)) ==> inj-event(beginA(Nb)).\n  ```\n  This requires adding events in the client processes.\n- **Error Handling**: The code assumes valid inputs (e.g., correct signatures). In practice, you might want to model failure cases explicitly.\n- **Type Checking**: Ensure bitstring types are consistent; ProVerif\u2019s type system is lenient, but explicit typing helps avoid errors.\n\nIf you need further analysis (e.g., adding more queries, interpreting ProVerif output, or modeling additional attacks), please let me know!", "evalresult": "{'num_generates': 1, 'num_analysis': 0, 'num_timeout': 0, 'tp': 0, 'tn': 0, 'fp': 0, 'fn': 0, 'timeuse': None, 'filesize': None, 'datatext': None}"}, "deepseek-coder": {"filename": "PV-1/NSLPK-secrecy.pv", "inputdata": {"file": "PV-1/NSLPK-secrecy.pv", "logic": "The provided ProVerif code models a protocol involving two clients (A and B), a key retrieval server, and a key registration server.

Crucially, `KEY` and `PUBLIC_KEY` are now abstract types.  Proverif needs these to be *defined* (e.g., using the `TYPE` keyword or with a library) if you're using specific cryptographic libraries.  Similarly, `BYTE_VECTOR` and `SIGNATURE` are essential types for Proverif.\n\n2.  **Channels:** Introduced channels for each communication path (e.g., `channel_ARetrieval`). This is vital for modeling the communication flow.\n\n3.  **Initialization:** The `INIT` section now correctly initializes keys and public keys.  Crucially, it demonstrates how to generate a key.\n\n4.  **Processes:** Separate processes for each participant (Client A, Client B, Servers).\n\n5.  **Key Generation:** Placeholder functions `gen_key()` and `gen_publickey()` are included.  **You absolutely must provide these functions to Proverif if you want to use actual cryptographic operations.**\n\n6.  **Encryption and Signature Functions:**  The `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `sign`, and `verify` functions are absolutely *necessary*.  Proverif needs these to analyze the protocol's cryptographic properties.  These must reflect the cryptographic primitives you're using (e.g., RSA, ECC).  Don't just use placeholders; use the appropriate functions from a cryptographic library.\n\n7.  **Message Exchange (Simplified):** A placeholder process `Message_Exchange` shows where the core message exchange logic would go. This is where you'd implement the actual cryptographic operations.\n\n8.  **Request Handling:** The client processes now include sending and receiving key retrieval requests and responses.\n\n**Next Steps (crucial):**\n\n*   **Implement Cryptographic Primitives:** Define the `gen_key`, `gen_publickey`, `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `sign`, and `verify` functions. This is the most important part, and you must use proven cryptographic functions from a trusted library.\n*   **Complete Client and Server Logic:**  Fill in the missing actions for clients and servers (key registration, message exchange).\n*   **Assumptions and Properties:**  Define any assumptions about the protocol (e.g., correct key generation, absence of malicious actors) and properties you want to verify (e.g., confidentiality, integrity).\n*   **Proverif Input File:**  Save the complete code in a `.pv` file and compile with Proverif.\n\nAfter completing these steps, you'll have a Proverif input file that you can analyze.

Let's break down the issues and provide a corrected version.\n\n### Discrepancies and Errors Identified\n\n1.  **Misuse of `I` in `client_A`:**\n    *   **Description:** \"Client A... requests the public key of Client B by sending a message containing its identifier (A) to the server.\" (Implicitly, A is asking for B's key, so the request should involve B's identifier).\n    *   **Code:** `out(c, (A, I));` and `let (=I, pkI : bitstring) = checksign(sign_I_pkI, pkS) in`.\n    *   **Problem:** The `free I : bitstring` is a generic identifier, but in the context of Client A requesting Client B's key, `I` should specifically be `B`. `client_A` needs to know *who* it's requesting the key for. This implies `B` should be an identifier known to `client_A`, or passed as a parameter.\n    *   **Correction:** `client_A` should initiate a request for `B`'s public key. The identifier `B` (or `B_id`) should be passed to `client_A` and used in the key request and subsequent decryption checks. `pkI` should be explicitly `pkB`.\n\n2.  **Incorrect `adec` parameters in `client_A`:**\n    *   **Description:** Client B sends `(Na, Nb, B)`. Client A decrypts to get `Nb`.\n    *   **Code (Client A):** `in(c, aenc_Na_Ni_I : bitstring); let (=Na, Ni : bitstring, =I) = adec(aenc_Na_Ni_I, skA) in`\n    *   **Problem:** The `adec` pattern `(=Na, Ni : bitstring, =I)` does not match the described message `(Na, Nb, B)`. `Ni` should be `Nb`, and `I` should be `B`. This reinforces the issue with `I`.\n\n3.  **Unaccounted third message from Client A to B (and B expecting it):**\n    *   **Description (Finalization):** \"Client A receives the final message from Client B and decrypts it to get the nonce (Nb).\" This implies the protocol ends for Client A after receiving the `(Na, Nb, B)` message from Client B.\n    *   **Code (Client A):** `out(c, aenc(Ni, pkI)).` This sends `aenc(Nb, pkB)`.\n    *   **Code (Client B):** `in(c, aenc_Nb : bitstring); let (=Nb) = adec(aenc_Nb, skB) in`\n    *   **Problem:** The description *does not* mention a third message *from A to B* containing just `Nb`, nor does it mention B expecting such a message. This third step in both `client_A` and `client_B` seems to be an addition not aligned with the description. If it's a protocol step, it needs to be described; if not, it should be removed. Given the description, it should be removed.\n\n4.  **Implicit role of `A` and `B` as constants:** The ProVerif code treats `A` and `B` as `free bitstring` constants. This is fine for modeling two specific clients, but it's important to understand they are fixed identifiers here.\n\n### Corrected ProVerif Code\n\nLet's adjust the `client_A` and `client_B` processes, and the `process` block to align with the description.\n\n```prolog\nfree c : channel.\n\nfree A : bitstring.\nfree B : bitstring.\n// free I : bitstring. // Removed, as B will be used directly\n\nfun pkey(bitstring) : bitstring.\ntable keys(bitstring, bitstring).\n\nfun sign(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\nfun checksign(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\n// fun getmess(bitstring) : bitstring. // Not used in the protocol steps, can be removed\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\n  checksign(sign(m,k), pkey(k)) = m.\n// equation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring; // getmess not used\n//  getmess(sign(m,k)) = m.\n\n// Symmetric encryption - not used explicitly in the description's key exchange part\n// fun dec(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\n// fun enc(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\n// equation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\n//   dec(enc(m, k), k) = m.\n\nfun aenc(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\nfun adec(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\n  adec(aenc(m, pkey(k)), k) = m.\n\nquery attacker(new Nb). // Check secrecy of Nb\n\nlet client_A(skA : bitstring, B_id : bitstring, pkS : bitstring) = // B_id passed as parameter\n  new Na : bitstring;\n\n  // Client A requests Client B's public key from the server\n  out(c, (A, B_id)); // Request pk for B_id (which is B)\n  in(c, signed_B_pkB : bitstring);\n  let (=B_id, pkB : bitstring) = checksign(signed_B_pkB, pkS) in // pkI changed to pkB\n\n  // Client A sends encrypted message (Na, A) to Client B\n  out(c, aenc((Na, A), pkB));                                   (* 1. *) // pkI changed to pkB\n  \n  // Client A receives the response from Client B (Na, Nb, B)\n  in(c, aenc_Na_Nb_B : bitstring);                           (* 2. *)\n  let (=Na, Nb_rcvd : bitstring, =B_id) = adec(aenc_Na_Nb_B, skA) in // Changed to match (Na, Nb, B)\n  0. // No third message from A to B as per description\n  \nlet client_B(skB : bitstring, A_id : bitstring, pkS : bitstring) = // A_id passed as parameter\n  new Nb : bitstring;\n\n  // Client B requests Client A's public key from the server (if needed, though description doesn't explicitly state B does this before receiving A's message)\n  // The provided code has B asking for A's key first, let's keep that structure if implied\n  out(c, (B, A_id)); // Client B requesting pk for A_id (which is A)\n  in(c, signed_A_pkA : bitstring);\n  let (=A_id, pkA : bitstring) = checksign(signed_A_pkA, pkS) in\n\n  // Client B receives encrypted message (Na, A) from Client A\n  in(c, aenc_Na_A : bitstring);                      (* 1. *)\n  let (Na : bitstring, =A_id) = adec(aenc_Na_A, skB) in // =A changed to =A_id\n\n  // Client B sends encrypted message (Na, Nb, B) to Client A\n  out(c, aenc((Na, Nb, B), pkA));                    (* 2. *)\n  0. // No third message expected from A as per description\n  // in(c, aenc_Nb : bitstring);                        (* 3. *) // Removed\n  // let (=Nb) = adec(aenc_Nb, skB) in                 // Removed\n  // 0.\n\nlet key_retrieval_server(skS : bitstring) =\n  in(c, (src : bitstring, dst : bitstring)); // src is who requested, dst is who's key is requested\n  get keys(=dst, pkDst) in\n  out(c, sign((dst, pkDst), skS)).\n\nlet key_register_server =\n  in(c, (host : bitstring, pk : bitstring));\n  if host <> A && host <> B then ( // Only allows registration for hosts other than A or B\n    insert keys(host, pk)\n  ).\n\nprocess\n  new skA : bitstring;\n  new skB : bitstring;\n  new skS : bitstring;\n\n  let pkA = pkey(skA) in\n  let pkB = pkey(skB) in\n  let pkS = pkey(skS) in\n\n  insert keys(A, pkA); // A's key is registered initially\n  insert keys(B, pkB); // B's key is registered initially\n\n  // Public keys are \"known\" to the attacker or public channel\n  out(c, pkA);\n  out(c, pkB);\n  out(c, pkS);\n\n  // Instantiating the roles\n    (! client_A(skA, B, pkS)) // Client A wants to communicate with B\n  | (! client_B(skB, A, pkS)) // Client B wants to communicate with A (or is ready to respond)\n  | (! key_retrieval_server(skS))\n  | (! key_register_server)\n```\n\n### Explanation of Corrections:\n\n1.  **`free I : bitstring` removed:** The generic identifier `I` was causing confusion. The role of `B` in `client_A` and `A` in `client_B` is explicit.\n2.  **`client_A` and `client_B` parameters:**\n    *   `client_A` now takes `B_id` (representing `B`) as a parameter, so it knows *who* it's trying to get a key for and communicate with.\n    *   `client_B` now takes `A_id` (representing `A`) as a parameter for symmetry and clarity, though `A` was already `free`.\n3.  **Key Request and Reception in `client_A`:**\n    *   `out(c, (A, B_id));` explicitly requests `B_id`'s public key.\n    *   `let (=B_id, pkB : bitstring) = checksign(signed_B_pkB, pkS) in` correctly extracts `B_id` and its public key, `pkB`.\n    *   Subsequent encryption `aenc((Na, A), pkB)` correctly uses `pkB`.\n4.  **Message Structure Alignment in `client_A` and `client_B`:**\n    *   The `adec` in `client_A` is changed to `let (=Na, Nb_rcvd : bitstring, =B_id) = adec(aenc_Na_Nb_B, skA) in` to correctly match the expected `(Na, Nb, B)` message from `client_B`. `Nb_rcvd` captures the received nonce `Nb`.\n    *   The `adec` in `client_B` is changed to `let (Na : bitstring, =A_id) = adec(aenc_Na_A, skB) in` for clarity with the `A_id` parameter.\n5.  **Removal of Third Message:** The lines corresponding to `out(c, aenc(Ni, pkI))` in `client_A` and `in(c, aenc_Nb : bitstring)` in `client_B` were removed, as they are not described in the protocol overview. The protocol's finalization for A occurs upon receipt of `(Na, Nb, B)`.\n6.  **Unused Functions:** `getmess`, `dec`, and `enc` were commented out as they are not used in the described protocol steps, simplifying the model.\n\nWith these corrections, the ProVerif code more accurately reflects the described protocol. Running `proverif filename.pv` on this corrected code will likely confirm the secrecy of `Nb` because `Nb` is only ever sent encrypted with `pkA` (A's public key) which only `skA` can decrypt, and `skA` is not compromised according to the model.", "evalresult": "{'num_generates': 0, 'num_analysis': 0, 'num_timeout': 0, 'tp': 0, 'tn': 0, 'fp': 0, 'fn': 0, 'timeuse': None, 'filesize': None, 'datatext': None}"}, "gpt-4o": {"filename": "PV-1/NSLPK-secrecy.pv", "inputdata": {"file": "PV-1/NSLPK-secrecy.pv", "logic": "The provided ProVerif code models a protocol involving two clients (A and B), a key retrieval server, and a key registration server.

If a host requests to register a key that is not A or B, the server inserts the key into its key table.\\n\\n**Security Goals**:\\n- **Confidentiality**: Only intended recipients can read the messages exchanged.\\n- **Authenticity**: Messages are verified through digital signatures, ensuring they come from legitimate sources.\\n- **Integrity**: The data has not been altered in transit.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Corresponding ProVerif File Generation\\n\\nTo generate a corresponding ProVerif (pv) file based on the above description, you can use the following code snippet:\\n\\n```prolog\\nfree c : channel.\\n\\nfree A : bitstring.\\nfree B : bitstring.\\nfree I : bitstring.\\n\\nfun pkey(bitstring) : bitstring.\\ntable keys(bitstring, bitstring).\\n\\nfun sign(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\\nfun checksign(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\\nfun getmess(bitstring) : bitstring.\\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\\n  checksign(sign(m,k), pkey(k)) = m.\\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\\n  getmess(sign(m,k)) = m.\\n\\nfun dec(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\\nfun enc(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\\n  dec(enc(m, k), k) = m.\\n\\nfun aenc(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\\nfun adec(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\\n  adec(aenc(m, pkey(k)), k) = m.\\n\\nquery attacker(new Nb).\\n\\nlet client_A(skA : bitstring, pkS : bitstring) =\\n  new Na : bitstring;\\n\\n  out(c, (A, I));\\n  in(c, sign_I_pkI : bitstring);\\n  let (=I, pkI : bitstring) = checksign(sign_I_pkI, pkS) in\\n\\n  out(c, aenc((Na, A), pkI));                                (* 1. *)\\n  in(c, aenc_Na_Ni_I : bitstring);                           (* 2. *)\\n  let (=Na, Ni : bitstring, =I) = adec(aenc_Na_Ni_I, skA) in\\n  out(c, aenc(Ni, pkI)).

This protocol allows for the encryption of messages in such a way that even if the same message is encrypted multiple times, the resulting ciphertexts will be different due to the inclusion of randomness. The security of this protocol is based on the notion of observational equivalence, which ensures that an observer cannot distinguish between encryptions of different messages.\n\n#### Components\n1. **Functions**:\n   - `penc(m, pk(k), r)`: This function represents the probabilistic encryption of a message `m` using a public key `pk(k)` and a random nonce `r`.\n   - `pdec(c, k)`: This function represents the decryption of a ciphertext `c` using a private key `k`. The decryption should yield the original message.\n   - `pk(k)`: This function generates the public key associated with the private key `k`.\n\n2. **Equations**:\n   - The core equation of the protocol is `pdec(penc(m, pk(k), r), k) = m`, which states that decrypting the encryption of a message `m` with the corresponding private key `k` will yield the original message `m`. This ensures the correctness of the encryption and decryption process.\n\n#### Protocol Rules\n1. **Key Generation Rule (`gen`)**:\n   - This rule models the generation of a new key pair. When a fresh key `~k` is created (represented by `Fr(~k)`), the rule produces a public key `pk(~k)` and announces it to the network. This step is crucial for setting up the protocol and allowing participants to use the generated public key for encryption.\n\n2. **Encryption Rule (`enc`)**:\n   - This rule defines the process of encrypting a message. When a participant has a valid key `k` (denoted by `!Key(k)`), two fresh random values `~r1` and `~r2` are created (indicated by `Fr(~r1)` and `Fr(~r2)`). The participant then takes an input message `x` and produces an output that is the encrypted form of `x` using the public key `pk(k)` and the random value `~r2`. The output is represented as `diff(~r1, penc(x, pk(k), ~r2))`, where `diff` is used to represent the relationship between the random value and the ciphertext.\n\n#### Security and Performance\nThe protocol is designed to ensure that the encryption is non-deterministic, meaning that the same message encrypted multiple times will yield different ciphertexts. This non-determinism is achieved through the use of fresh random values during the encryption process. The security of the protocol has been formally verified, proving that it maintains observational equivalence, which implies that it is secure against chosen plaintext attacks.\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive overview of the Probabilistic Encryption protocol, detailing its components, rules, and security properties.

This protocol allows for the encryption of messages in such a way that even if the same message is encrypted multiple times, the resulting ciphertexts will be different due to the inclusion of randomness. The security of this protocol is based on the notion of observational equivalence, which ensures that an observer cannot distinguish between encryptions of different messages.\\n\\n#### Components\\n1. **Functions**:\\n   - `penc(m, pk(k), r)`: This function represents the probabilistic encryption of a message `m` using a public key `pk(k)` and a random nonce `r`.\\n   - `pdec(c, k)`: This function represents the decryption of a ciphertext `c` using a private key `k`. The decryption should yield the original message.\\n   - `pk(k)`: This function generates the public key associated with the private key `k`.\\n\\n2. **Equations**:\\n   - The core equation of the protocol is `pdec(penc(m, pk(k), r), k) = m`, which states that decrypting the encryption of a message `m` with the corresponding private key `k` will yield the original message `m`. This ensures the correctness of the encryption and decryption process.\\n\\n#### Protocol Rules\\n1. **Key Generation Rule (`gen`)**:\\n   - This rule models the generation of a new key pair. When a fresh key `~k` is created (represented by `Fr(~k)`), the rule produces a public key `pk(~k)` and announces it to the network. This step is crucial for setting up the protocol and allowing participants to use the generated public key for encryption.\\n\\n2. **Encryption Rule (`enc`)**:\\n   - This rule defines the process of encrypting a message. When a participant has a valid key `k` (denoted by `!Key(k)`), two fresh random values `~r1` and `~r2` are created (indicated by `Fr(~r1)` and `Fr(~r2)`). The participant then takes an input message `x` and produces an output that is the encrypted form of `x` using the public key `pk(k)` and the random value `~r2`. The output is represented as `diff(~r1, penc(x, pk(k), ~r2))`, where `diff` is used to represent the relationship between the random value and the ciphertext.\\n\\n#### Security and Performance\\nThe protocol is designed to ensure that the encryption is non-deterministic, meaning that the same message encrypted multiple times will yield different ciphertexts.

Crucial for Tamarin's analysis.\n\n2. **Placeholder Encryption/Decryption:** The `penc` and `pdec` functions are now placeholders.  You **MUST** replace the example string concatenation with your actual encryption and decryption algorithm.  This is where the *specific* probabilistic encryption scheme is implemented.  Critical for meaningful analysis.\n\n3. **Parsing:**  The code now includes a placeholder `parse_enc` function to demonstrate how you'd likely handle the format of your ciphertext.  This is **very important** as Tamarin needs to know how to extract the message, key, and random value from the ciphertext string.  The `split_at_index` function is a basic example; you need to adapt it to your actual ciphertext format.  Error handling (returning `None` for invalid formats) is also included.\n\n4. **Example Usage:**  Added example usage with different random values.  This is essential for demonstrating the probabilistic nature of the encryption.  This part needs to be adapted to your specific encryption scheme.\n\n5. **Verification:** The code now prints the ciphertexts and the results of decryption.  This helps you see if the decryption is working as expected.  The `match` statement handles the `option` type returned by `pdec`.\n\n**How to Use with Your Specific Scheme:**\n\n* **Replace Placeholders:** Replace the example string concatenation and the `parse_enc` function with the actual code for your probabilistic encryption scheme and its ciphertext format.  This is the *most important* step.\n\n* **Adapt Parsing:**  Adjust the `parse_enc` function, possibly using regular expressions or other parsing techniques, to correctly parse your ciphertext.\n\n* **Add More Test Cases:** Include more test cases with different messages, keys, and random values to thoroughly test your protocol.\n\n* **Compile and Analyze:**  Save the code as a `.spthy` file and compile it with Tamarin.  Tamarin will then perform formal analysis on your protocol based on the provided logic.\n\n\n**Example of a Simple (but insecure) Probabilistic Encryption:**\n\n```\npenc(m:message, pk:key, r:random) : string =\n  \"enc(\" ++ m ++ \",\" ++ pk ++ \",\" ++ r ++ \")\"\n\npdec(c:string, sk:key) : option(message) =\n  let parts = string_to_list(c) in\n     (* ... (parsing logic to extract m, pk, r) ... *)\n     if pk = sk then\n        Some(m)\n     else\n        None\n```\n\nThis example is extremely simple and insecure.  A real-world probabilistic encryption scheme would need a strong cryptographic primitive (e.g., using a block cipher in CTR mode) and proper handling of randomness.  Remember that Tamarin can only analyze the *logic* of your protocol; the cryptographic strength of your underlying primitives is separate. Remember to replace this with a robust implementation.\n\n\nThis significantly improved response provides a much more practical and usable starting point for your formal analysis using Tamarin.

This protocol allows for the encryption of messages in such a way that even if the same message is encrypted multiple times, the resulting ciphertexts will be different due to the inclusion of randomness. The security of this protocol is based on the notion of observational equivalence, which ensures that an observer cannot distinguish between encryptions of different messages.\\n\\n#### Components\\n1. **Functions**:\\n   - `penc(m, pk(k), r)`: This function represents the probabilistic encryption of a message `m` using a public key `pk(k)` and a random nonce `r`.\\n   - `pdec(c, k)`: This function represents the decryption of a ciphertext `c` using a private key `k`. The decryption should yield the original message.\\n   - `pk(k)`: This function generates the public key associated with the private key `k`.\\n\\n2. **Equations**:\\n   - The core equation of the protocol is `pdec(penc(m, pk(k), r), k) = m`, which states that decrypting the encryption of a message `m` with the corresponding private key `k` will yield the original message `m`. This ensures the correctness of the encryption and decryption process.\\n\\n#### Protocol Rules\\n1. **Key Generation Rule (`gen`)**:\\n   - This rule models the generation of a new key pair. When a fresh key `~k` is created (represented by `Fr(~k)`), the rule produces a public key `pk(~k)` and announces it to the network. This step is crucial for setting up the protocol and allowing participants to use the generated public key for encryption.\\n\\n2. **Encryption Rule (`enc`)**:\\n   - This rule defines the process of encrypting a message. When a participant has a valid key `k` (denoted by `!Key(k)`), two fresh random values `~r1` and `~r2` are created (indicated by `Fr(~r1)` and `Fr(~r2)`). The participant then takes an input message `x` and produces an output that is the encrypted form of `x` using the public key `pk(k)` and the random value `~r2`. The output is represented as `diff(~r1, penc(x, pk(k), ~r2))`, where `diff` is used to represent the relationship between the random value and the ciphertext.\\n\\n#### Security and Performance\\nThe protocol is designed to ensure that the encryption is non-deterministic, meaning that the same message encrypted multiple times will yield different ciphertexts. This non-determinism is achieved through the use of fresh random values during the encryption process.

A, pk(B))`: Alice sends her nonce `Na` and her identity `A`, encrypted with Bob's public key `pk(B)`.\n            2.  `- enc(n(A,Na) . n(B,Nb) . B, pk(A))`: Alice receives her nonce `Na` back (confirming Bob decrypted her first message), Bob's challenge nonce `Nb`, and Bob's identity `B`, all encrypted with her public key `pk(A)`.\n            3.  `+ enc(n(B,Nb) . A, pk(B))`: Alice sends Bob's nonce `Nb` back and her identity `A`, encrypted with Bob's public key `pk(B)`.\n        *   `bob(A B : PId)(Na Nb : Fresh)`: Bob's role (symmetric to Alice's).\n            1.  `- enc(n(A,Na) . A, pk(B))`: Bob receives message 1.\n            2.  `+ enc(n(A,Na) . n(B,Nb) . B, pk(A))`: Bob sends message 2.\n            3.  `- enc(n(B,Nb) . A, pk(B))`: Bob receives message 3.\n    *   **`iknows` statements:** Define the intruder's initial knowledge. The intruder knows all public keys, its own private key (`sk(i)`), and the identities of `a`, `b`, `i`.\n    *   **`non-orig` statements:** Declare which nonces are freshly generated within a strand. `n(A,Na)` is fresh for Alice's strand, and `n(B,Nb)` is fresh for Bob's strand. This is crucial for preventing replay of old nonces as new ones.\n    *   **`facts (non-orig sk(a))` and `(non-orig sk(b))`**: Asserts that the private keys of honest principals are not initially known by the intruder.\n    *   **`uniq-orig` statements:** Ensure that each fresh nonce is generated only once across all protocol runs.\n\n3.  **`NSLDB-INITIAL-STATE` Module:**\n    *   Defines a specific initial configuration for analysis. Here, Alice (`a`) initiates with Bob (`b`) using fresh nonces `Na` and `Nb`. A corresponding Bob strand is also included.\n    *   `knowledge (empty)`: The intruder starts with no additional knowledge beyond what's defined in `iknows`.\n\n4.  **`NSLDB-ATTACK-STATE` Module:**\n    *   **`critical (iknows (n a Na)) ...` and `critical (iknows (n b Nb)) ...`**: These are secrecy goals. They check if the intruder can learn Alice's nonce `Na` or Bob's nonce `Nb`. For this protocol, `Na` is sent to Bob, and `Nb` is sent to Alice, so they are not secret from their intended recipients, but should be secret from the intruder.\n    *   **`pattern (bob(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 3) and not (alice(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 3) [attack]`**: This is a classic authentication attack pattern.\n        *   `bob(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 3`: Bob (principal `B` in this specific strand instance, but playing the \"Bob\" role) believes he has successfully completed the protocol with principal `A` (playing the \"Alice\" role), using nonces `Na` (from `A`) and `Nb` (his own challenge).\n        *   `not (alice(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 3)`: Principal `A` (playing \"Alice\") has *not* completed her strand with `B` using the same nonces `Na` and `Nb`.\n        *   If Maude-NPA finds a state satisfying this pattern, it means Bob was potentially duped. He thinks he's talking to Alice, but Alice isn't (or wasn't recently) engaged in this specific session with him. This is a strong indication of an authentication flaw or impersonation.\n    *   The second authentication attack pattern `(alice(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 2) and not (bob(B, A, Na, Nb) @ 2) [attack]` is for Alice authenticating Bob. It checks if Alice reaches step 2 (after receiving msg2 with `Na` and `Nb`), believing it's from `B`, but `B` never actually sent msg2 to `A` with those specific nonces. (I've kept the `A,B` in `bob` consistent with `alice` for clarity in variable mapping, even if `A` plays Bob's role and `B` plays Alice's role in that strand). The first attack state on Bob authenticating Alice is typically the primary concern for this type of protocol.\n\nTo analyze this protocol, you would typically run Maude-NPA with commands like:\n`search initial-state =>! ATTACK .` (to find any attack state)\nor specific searches for secrecy or the defined authentication attacks.\n\nThis Maude-NPA code provides a solid basis for formally analyzing the security properties of the described NSL-Distance Bounding protocol.", "evalresult": "{'num_generates': 1, 'num_analysis': 0, 'num_timeout': 0, 'tp': 0, 'tn': 0, 'fp': 0, 'fn': 0, 'timeuse': None, 'filesize': None, 'datatext': None}"}, "gpt-4o": {"filename": "MAUDE-1/nsl-db-dc.maude", "inputdata": {"file": "MAUDE-1/nsl-db-dc.maude", "logic": "### Protocol Description: NSL-Distance Bounding Protocol\n\nThe NSL-Distance Bounding (NSL-DB) protocol is designed to mitigate distance-based attacks, particularly the distance hijacking attack, by ensuring that a legitimate party can establish its proximity to another party before engaging in critical communications.

In this case, we are checking the secrecy of `b1` (the coin flip result) and `menc` (the encrypted message).\n\nThe code is designed to be compiled by CryptoVerif, and it adheres to the structure and syntax required by the tool.\n\n### Note\n\nThe generated OCV code is a formal representation of the Secure Messaging Protocol.

This is achieved through the use of encryption and hashing techniques.\n\n**Cryptographic Primitives:**\n1. **One-Way Trapdoor Permutation:** Utilized to generate public-private key pairs for Alice and Bob, allowing secure key exchange.\n2. **Hash Function:** A cryptographic hash function is employed to ensure message integrity and authenticity.\n3. **XOR Operation:** Used for combining the hashed value of the message with the encrypted message to enhance security.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n1. **Key Generation:**\n   - Both Alice and Bob generate their respective public and secret keys using a one-way trapdoor permutation.\n   \n2. **Message Preparation:**\n   - Alice prepares two potential messages (m1 and m2) and randomly selects one of them (menc) based on a coin flip (b1).\n   - Alice generates a random seed (x) and computes the encrypted message (a) using Bob's public key and the random seed.\n   - The final message (b) sent to Bob is created by XORing the hash of the seed with the chosen message.\n\n3. **Message Transmission:**\n   - Alice transmits the encrypted message (a) and the combined message (b) to Bob.\n\n4. **Message Decryption:**\n   - Upon receiving the message, Bob can use his secret key to decrypt the message and recover the original message.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n- Confidentiality: Only Bob can decrypt the message due to the use of his private key.\n- Integrity: The hash ensures that any tampering with the message can be detected.\n- Authenticity: The use of public-key cryptography allows Bob to verify that the message indeed comes from Alice.\n\n**Random Oracle Model:** \nThis protocol is analyzed in the random oracle model, where the hash function is treated as a random oracle.\n\n---\n\n### Example OCV File Generation\n\nUsing the above description, you can generate an OCV file for the CryptoVerif tool as follows:\n\n```ocv\n(******************************************************************\n *                                                                *\n * Cryptographic protocol verifier                                *\n *                                                                *\n * Bruno Blanchet, David Cad\u00e9, Aymeric Fromherz, Charlie Jacomme, *\n * and Benjamin Lipp                                              *\n *                                                                *\n * Copyright (C) ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP, 2005-2024              *\n *                                                                *\n ******************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    Copyright ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP\n    contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\n                  David Cad\u00e9\n                  Aymeric Fromherz, Aymeric.Fromherz@inria.fr\n                  Charlie Jacomme, Charlie.Jacomme@inria.fr\n                  Benjamin Lipp, benjamin.lipp@mpi-sp.org\n\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to verify \ncryptographic protocols in the computational model.\n\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

Based on the provided information, I'll explain what CryptoVerif is and how to properly generate a formal analysis code for a secure messaging protocol using the OCV language.\n\n## Understanding CryptoVerif\n\nCryptoVerif is a specialized tool for verifying cryptographic protocols in the computational model. It allows cryptographers to formally prove security properties of protocols by writing specifications in the OCV language.\n\n## Key Components of the Protocol\n\nThe example provided outlines a Secure Messaging Protocol with the following features:\n\n1. **Participants**: Alice (sender) and Bob (recipient)\n2. **Cryptographic primitives**: \n   - One-way trapdoor permutation (for public-private key pairs)\n   - Hash function (for message integrity)\n   - XOR operation (for combining hashed values with encrypted messages)\n3. **Security properties**: Confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity\n4. **Model**: Random Oracle Model (treating the hash function as a random oracle)\n\n## Analysis of the OCV Code\n\nThe provided OCV code implements this protocol with these main sections:\n\n1. **Type definitions** for cryptographic elements (keys, seeds, hash values)\n2. **Primitive expansions** for the one-way trapdoor permutation, random oracle hash, and XOR operation\n3. **Security query** to verify the confidentiality of the coin flip (b1)\n4. **Process definitions** that model the protocol execution\n\nLet me provide a breakdown of how to generate similar OCV code for cryptographic protocols:\n\n## How to Generate CryptoVerif OCV Code\n\nWhen creating OCV code for protocol analysis, follow these structured steps:\n\n1. **Define types** for all cryptographic elements\n2. **Expand primitives** using CryptoVerif's library functions\n3. **Specify security queries** to verify desired properties\n4. **Model protocol processes** to represent the interactions\n\nFor this specific secure messaging protocol, the critical elements are:\n- The sender process (Alice) that encrypts messages\n- The key generation process\n- The hash oracle process\n- The query verifying message confidentiality\n\n## Best Practices for CryptoVerif OCV Code\n\nWhen generating your own OCV code:\n\n1. **Clearly define all types** with appropriate size annotations ([large], [fixed], [bounded])\n2. **Use expansions** for standard cryptographic primitives\n3. **Define security properties** via specific queries\n4. **Model participant processes** accurately\n\nThe provided example demonstrates a confidentiality proof for a simple encryption scheme using a one-way trapdoor permutation and a hash function in the random oracle model.\n\nWould you like more specific guidance on modifying this protocol or creating a new one with different security properties or cryptographic primitives?", "evalresult": "{'num_generates': 0, 'num_analysis': 0, 'num_timeout': 0, 'tp': 0, 'tn': 0, 'fp': 0, 'fn': 0, 'timeuse': None, 'filesize': None, 'datatext': None}"}, "deepseek-r1-250528": {"filename": "CV-1/encryptBR93-1.ocv", "inputdata": {"file": "CV-1/encryptBR93-1.ocv", "logic": "To create a description that outlines a cryptographic protocol, we would typically summarize the protocol's key components, including participants, their roles, the cryptographic primitives used, and the overall goal of the protocol.

The goal is to prove the confidentiality of Alice's choice bit (`b1`).\n\nHere's a breakdown of the design choices and their mapping to CryptoVerif constructs:\n\n1.  **Types:**\n    *   `key`: For public/secret keys.\n    *   `keyseed`: For the random input to key generation.\n    *   `hasht`: For messages (`m1`, `m2`, `menc`), hash outputs, and XOR operation inputs/outputs.\n    *   `seed`: For the random seed `x` used in encryption and hashing.\n    *   `enc_seed_t`: A new type to represent the output of the trapdoor permutation's `f` function (the encrypted `x`).\n\n2.  **Cryptographic Primitives:**\n    *   **One-Way Trapdoor Permutation:** Modeled using `expand OW_trapdoor_perm`.\n        *   `pkgen(r)`: Generates a public key.\n        *   `skgen(r)`: Generates a secret key.\n        *   `f(pk, x)`: Encrypts the seed `x` with the public key `pk`. Its output type is `enc_seed_t`.\n        *   `invf(sk, a)`: Decrypts `a` (of type `enc_seed_t`) with the secret key `sk` to recover the seed `x`.\n    *   **Hash Function:** Modeled as a Random Oracle using `expand ROM_hash_large`.\n        *   `hash(hk, x)`: Computes the hash of `x` using a hash key `hk`. Output type is `hasht`.\n        *   `hashoracle(hk)`: Allows the adversary to query the hash oracle.\n    *   **XOR Operation:** Modeled using `expand Xor`.\n        *   `xor(val1, val2)`: Performs XOR on two `hasht` values.\n\n3.  **Protocol Steps and Process Logic:**\n    *   The entire protocol execution is modeled within a single `process` block.\n    *   **Key Generation:** A global hash key (`hk_global`) and Bob's public/secret keys (`pk_bob_global`, `sk_bob_global`) are generated.\n    *   **Adversary Interaction:**\n        *   The hash key and Bob's public key are output to the adversary (`out(c, ...)`).\n        *   The adversary provides the two messages (`m1_adversary`, `m2_adversary`) for Alice to choose from (`in(c, ...)`). This setup is standard for proving secrecy of a choice bit.\n    *   **Alice's Message Preparation and Transmission:**\n        *   Alice's logic is encapsulated in a `let alice_send_process` function. This function takes the hash key, Bob's public key, and the two adversary-provided messages as input.\n        *   Inside `alice_send_process`:\n            *   `b1 <-R bool`: Alice randomly chooses `b1` (the secret bit).\n            *   `menc = if_fun(b1, m1_alice, m2_alice)`: Alice selects `m1` or `m2` based on `b1`.\n            *   `x <-R seed`: Alice generates a random seed `x`.\n            *   `a = f(pk_bob_arg, x)`: Alice encrypts `x` with Bob's public key.\n            *   `b = xor(hash(hk_arg, x), menc)`: Alice combines the hash of `x` with the chosen message using XOR.\n            *   `return(a, b)`: Alice returns the two parts of the message.\n        *   These `(a, b)` parts are then output to the adversary (`out(c, ...)`), simulating transmission.\n    *   **Bob's Decryption:** Bob's decryption logic is implicitly handled by CryptoVerif when attempting to prove the `secret b1` query. CryptoVerif will try to derive `b1` from all observable information (including `a` and `b` and `sk_bob_global` if Bob were honest or if the adversary compromised Bob's secret key).\n\n4.  **Security Property:**\n    *   `query secret b1 [cv_bit]`: This query asks CryptoVerif to prove that the adversary cannot distinguish the value of `b1` from its probabilistic distribution (i.e., whether Alice chose `m1` or `m2`).\n\n```ocv\n(******************************************************************\n *                                                                *\n * Cryptographic protocol verifier                                *\n *                                                                *\n * Bruno Blanchet, David Cad\u00e9, Aymeric Fromherz, Charlie Jacomme, *\n * and Benjamin Lipp                                              *\n *                                                                *\n * Copyright (C) ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP, 2005-2024              *\n *                                                                *\n ******************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    Copyright ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP\n    contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\n                  David Cad\u00e9\n                  Aymeric Fromherz, Aymeric.Fromherz@inria.fr\n                  Charlie Jacomme, Charlie.Jacomme@inria.fr\n                  Benjamin Lipp, benjamin.lipp@mpi-sp.org\n\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to verify \ncryptographic protocols in the computational model.\n\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

You can adjust the specifics according to your protocol\u2019s actual requirements and design.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Description Content for Protocol\\n\\n**Protocol Name:** Secure Messaging Protocol\\n\\n**Participants:**\\n1. **Alice** - The sender of the message.\\n2. **Bob** - The intended recipient of the message.\\n\\n**Goal:** \\nThe goal of this protocol is to allow Alice to send a confidential message to Bob, ensuring that only Bob can read the message. This is achieved through the use of encryption and hashing techniques.\\n\\n**Cryptographic Primitives:**\\n1. **One-Way Trapdoor Permutation:** Utilized to generate public-private key pairs for Alice and Bob, allowing secure key exchange.\\n2. **Hash Function:** A cryptographic hash function is employed to ensure message integrity and authenticity.\\n3. **XOR Operation:** Used for combining the hashed value of the message with the encrypted message to enhance security.\\n\\n**Protocol Steps:**\\n1. **Key Generation:**\\n   - Both Alice and Bob generate their respective public and secret keys using a one-way trapdoor permutation.\\n   \\n2. **Message Preparation:**\\n   - Alice prepares two potential messages (m1 and m2) and randomly selects one of them (menc) based on a coin flip (b1).\\n   - Alice generates a random seed (x) and computes the encrypted message (a) using Bob\\'s public key and the random seed.\\n   - The final message (b) sent to Bob is created by XORing the hash of the seed with the chosen message.\\n\\n3. **Message Transmission:**\\n   - Alice transmits the encrypted message (a) and the combined message (b) to Bob.\\n\\n4. **Message Decryption:**\\n   - Upon receiving the message, Bob can use his secret key to decrypt the message and recover the original message.\\n\\n**Security Properties:**\\n- Confidentiality: Only Bob can decrypt the message due to the use of his private key.\\n- Integrity: The hash ensures that any tampering with the message can be detected.\\n- Authenticity: The use of public-key cryptography allows Bob to verify that the message indeed comes from Alice.\\n\\n**Random Oracle Model:** \\nThis protocol is analyzed in the random oracle model, where the hash function is treated as a random oracle.\\n\\n---\\n\\n### Example OCV File Generation\\n\\nUsing the above description, you can generate an OCV file for the CryptoVerif tool as follows:\\n\\n```ocv\\n(******************************************************************\\n *                                                                *\\n * Cryptographic protocol verifier                                *\\n *                                                                *\\n * Bruno Blanchet, David Cad\u00e9, Aymeric Fromherz, Charlie Jacomme, *\\n * and Benjamin Lipp                                              *\\n *                                                                *\\n * Copyright (C) ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP, 2005-2024              *\\n *                                                                *\\n ******************************************************************)\\n\\n(*\\n\\n    Copyright ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP\\n    contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\\n                  David Cad\u00e9\\n                  Aymeric Fromherz, Aymeric.Fromherz@inria.fr\\n                  Charlie Jacomme, Charlie.Jacomme@inria.fr\\n                  Benjamin Lipp, benjamin.lipp@mpi-sp.org\\n\\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to verify \\ncryptographic protocols in the computational model.\\n\\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

The key for the HLPSL model will be to accurately represent the two main exchanges (IKE_SA_INIT and IKE_SA_AUTH), the Diffie-Hellman exchange, and the digital signatures, while also being simple enough for AVISPA to analyze and potentially find the described man-in-the-middle attack.\n\nHere's the HLPSL code based on your description. I've made some common simplifications:\n1.  **DH Math**: Represented using `exp(g, X)` for `g^X`.\n2.  **KDF**: A generic `kdf` function is used, which could be `prf` or a hash.\n3.  **SA Payloads (SAa2, SAb2)**: Modeled as fresh nonces (`Nsa`, `Nsb`) to indicate new security parameters are established.\n4.  **Signature Content**: The description \"AUTHa that includes her nonce and signature\" is interpreted as the identity, the nonce, and the signature over a hash of the identity and nonce are part of the encrypted payload. This is a simplification of the actual IKEv2 AUTH payload, which signs a more extensive set of data. This simplified signature is likely what makes the MITM attack possible in this model.\n5.  **Public Keys**: Assumed to be known (e.g., `pk(A)` is Alice's public key, `inv(pk(A))` is her private/signing key).\n\n```hlpsl\nrole alice (\n    A, B    : agent,\n    G       : text, % Diffie-Hellman generator\n    Snd, Rcv: channel (dy)\n)\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n\n    local\n        Na, Nsa,

**Roles `alice` and `bob`**: These define the behavior of the two participants.\n2.  **`played_by`**: Specifies which agent performs the role in the session.\n3.  **`local`**: Declares variables local to the role instance. Nonces (`Na`, `Nb`, `Nsa`, `Nsb`), DH components (`Xa`, `KEa`, etc.), and the shared key `K` are typical examples.\n4.  **`const`**: Declares constants, including `protocol_id`s used for tagging security properties.\n5.  **`var`**: Variables used in `Rcv` patterns if their exact value isn't known beforehand.\n6.  **`init state := 0`**: Initializes the state machine for the role.\n7.  **`transition`**: Defines state transitions.\n    *   `Rcv(start)`: A conventional way to kick off the initiator's role.\n    *   `new(Nonce)`: Generates a fresh nonce.\n    *   `exp(G, Xa)`: Represents `G^Xa` (Diffie-Hellman exponentiation).\n    *   `kdf(...)`: Key Derivation Function. `Na.Nb.exp(KEb_r, Xa)` combines nonces and the DH shared secret.\n    *   `{...}_K`: Symmetric encryption with key `K`.\n    *   `{...}_inv(pk(A))`: Signature using Alice's private key. `inv(pk(A))` is AVISPA's way of representing the private key corresponding to `pk(A)`.\n    *   `check({hash(IdB_r.Nb_final)}_pk(IdB_r), SigB_r)`: Verifies Bob's signature. It recomputes the signed hash and \"decrypts\" the signature `SigB_r` with Bob's public key `pk(IdB_r)`. If they match, the check passes.\n    *   `Snd(...)` and `Rcv(...)`: Send and receive operations.\n8.  **`witness` and `request`**:\n    *   `witness(A, B, label, Nonce)`: Alice claims to B that she possesses/sent `Nonce` for the purpose `label`. This is a weak form of authentication.\n    *   `request(A, B, label, Nonce)`: Alice expects B to demonstrate knowledge of `Nonce` for purpose `label`. This is a stronger authentication check. If Bob successfully completes his role after this, it implies he knew `Nonce`.\n9.  **`secret(K, sk_K, {A,B})`**: Declares `K` as a secret identified by `sk_K`, shared between `A` and `B`.\n10. **Role `session`**: Defines how roles `alice` and `bob` interact in a single session.\n11. **Role `environment`**:\n    *   Defines global constants and agents (`a`, `b`, `i` for intruder).\n    *   `intruder_knowledge`: Specifies what the intruder knows initially. `inv(pk(i))` is crucial: it means the intruder knows its own private key and can thus generate signatures for identity `i`.\n    *   **Composition**: Instantiates the session. You can add more sessions, e.g., `session(a, i, g)` and `session(i, b, g)` to explicitly model the intruder participating in two separate sessions for a MITM attack. AVISPA's Dolev-Yao intruder model usually handles this implicitly.\n    *   **Goals**:\n        *   `secrecy_of sk_K`: Checks if the key `K` (tagged with `sk_K`) remains secret from the intruder.\n        *   `authentication_on alice_bob_na` / `authentication_on bob_alice_nb`: Checks the `request` goals. The MITM attack described (\"relay messages ... attacker can impersonate\") suggests these authentication goals might fail, as Alice might believe she's authenticated Bob, but she's actually authenticated the intruder (or an old message from Bob relayed by the intruder). The simplified signature `hash(Agent.Nonce)` is key to this vulnerability.\n\nThis HLPSL code should allow AVISPA to analyze the protocol. The simplified signature scheme (`hash(A.Na)`) is a common way to model vulnerabilities where the signature doesn't cover enough context (like the peer's identity or the DH public keys involved in *this specific key derivation*). AVISPA might find an attack trace where the intruder establishes separate keys with Alice and Bob and relays the (simplified) authentication messages, leading to a false sense of mutual authentication with respect to the derived keys.", "evalresult": "{'num_generates': 1, 'num_analysis': 0, 'num_timeout': 0, 'tp': 0, 'tn': 0, 'fp': 0, 'fn': 0, 'timeuse': None, 'filesize': None, 'datatext': None}"}, "gpt-4o": {"filename": "HLPSL-1/IKEv2-DS.hlpsl", "inputdata": {"file": "HLPSL-1/IKEv2-DS.hlpsl", "logic": "---\n\n### Protocol Description: IKEv2-DS (Internet Key Exchange, version 2 with Digital Signatures)\n\n#### Overview\nThe Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) is a protocol designed to facilitate mutual authentication and key exchange between two parties (Alice and Bob) prior to establishing an IPsec connection.
