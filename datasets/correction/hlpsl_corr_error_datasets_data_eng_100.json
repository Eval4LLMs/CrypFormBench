        "logic": "### Protocol Overview\n\n1. **Purpose**:\n   - The CALP is intended to facilitate secure access control management between a server and a badge reader, ensuring that employee identities are communicated securely.\n\n2. **Roles**:\n   - **Badge Reader (B)**: This role represents the badge reader that initiates the access request to the server.\n   - **Server (S)**: This role represents the server that processes the access request from the badge reader.\n\n3. **Message Flow**:\n   - The protocol starts with the badge reader sending a message to the server containing the employee ID and badge ID, encrypted with the server's public key. The message format is `{IdBadgeuse, IdEmploye}_PKs`.\n   - Upon receiving this message, the server responds with an acknowledgment message `{Ok}_PKb`, confirming the receipt and processing of the request.\n   - The badge reader then acknowledges the server's response by sending another message `{Ok}_PKs`.\n\n4. **State Transitions**:\n   - The badge reader operates in a finite state machine:\n     - **State 0**: Waits for a start signal; upon receiving it, it transitions to State 1 and sends the employee and badge ID to the server.\n     - **State 1**: Waits for an acknowledgment from the server; upon receiving it, it transitions to State 2 and sends an acknowledgment back to the server.\n   - The server also has a state machine:\n     - **State 0**: Waits for a message from the badge reader; upon receiving the employee and badge ID, it transitions to State 1 and sends an acknowledgment.\n\n5. **Session Role**:\n   - A session is defined to encapsulate the interactions between the badge reader and server, ensuring that the messages are exchanged through designated channels.\n\n6. **Environment Role**:\n   - The environment role defines the agents and keys used, including an intruder model that knows certain public keys and can attempt to intercept messages, reflecting real-world scenarios where security might be tested against potential attacks.\n\n7. **Security Goals**:\n   - The primary goal of the protocol is to ensure the secrecy of the employee's identity during the communication process, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that only legitimate requests are processed.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe CALP protocol establishes a secure framework for managing access control in environments where identity verification is critical. The careful design of the message flow and state transitions, combined with the emphasis on secrecy, highlights the commitment to maintaining security in access control systems.",

        "logic": "### Description of the Control Access Loria Protocol (CALP)\n\nThe Control Access Loria Protocol (CALP) is designed to facilitate secure access control in environments where badges are used for authentication. The protocol involves two primary entities: a badge reader (Badgeuse) and a server (Serveur). The communication between these entities is structured to ensure both confidentiality and authentication of the involved parties.\n\n#### Purpose\nThe protocol serves two primary scenarios:\n1. Normal access request.\n2. Exceptional access request.\n\n#### Protocol Flow\nThe communication flow of CALP can be broken down into several key steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The badge reader (B) initiates the protocol by sending its identifier (`IdBadgeuse`) along with the employee's identifier (`IdEmploye`) to the server (S) encrypted with the server's public key (`PKs`). This message establishes the intent for an access request.\n\n2. **Session Key Establishment**:\n   - The server responds to the badge reader with a session key (`ClefSession`) encrypted using the badge reader's public key (`PKb`). This session key will be used for subsequent communication between the two parties.\n\n3. **Action Request**:\n   - The badge reader sends a message containing the type of action (`TypeAction`) it wishes to perform, encrypted with the established session key.\n\n4. **Confirmation**:\n   - The server processes the action and responds with a confirmation message that includes a hash of the action (`ok.H(Action')`), ensuring that the integrity of the action is maintained.\n\n5. **Finalization**:\n   - Both parties then confirm the completion of the process, with the server making a request to the badge reader for further actions if necessary.\n\n#### Roles in the Protocol\n- **Badgeuse Role**: Initiates the protocol, manages the state transitions, and handles the communication with the server. It maintains the session state and ensures that messages are sent and received in the correct order.\n  \n- **Serveur Role**: Responds to the badge reader's requests, manages session keys, and sends back action confirmations. It also maintains state transitions based on received messages.\n\n- **Session Role**: Encapsulates the interaction between the badge reader and the server, ensuring that both roles are executed in a concerted manner.\n\n- **Environment Role**: Simulates the overall protocol environment, allowing for multiple sessions to be instantiated. It also includes intruder knowledge, which is critical for analyzing the protocol against potential attacks.\n\n#### Security Goals\nThe protocol is designed with specific security goals in mind:\n- **Secrecy of Session Keys**: The session key and action must remain confidential and secure from unauthorized parties.\n- **Secrecy of Identifiers**: The identifiers of employees and servers should not be disclosed to potential attackers.\n- **Authentication**: Both the badge reader and the server must authenticate each other to prevent impersonation attacks.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Control Access Loria Protocol is structured to provide secure access control through a series of well-defined interactions between a badge reader and a server. By ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and authentication, CALP aims to protect sensitive information and prevent unauthorized access in environments that utilize badge systems for security.",
