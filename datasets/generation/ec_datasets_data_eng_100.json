It operates within a framework that allows for the execution of operations that may expose side information, ensuring that sensitive data is handled securely.\n\n#### Key Components\n\n1. **Public Data Type (`public_t`)**:\n   - Represents data that can be shared openly without any confidentiality concerns.\n\n2. **Input and Output Types**:\n   - `inputs_t`: Defines the structure of inputs that can be provided to the API.\n   - `outputs_t`: Defines the structure of outputs that the API can return.\n\n3. **Secret Variables (`svar_t`)**:\n   - Represents variables that store confidential information, which must be protected from unauthorized access.\n\n4. **Secret Operations (`sop_t`)**:\n   - Defines a set of operations that can be performed on secret variables, ensuring computations retain the confidentiality of the data.\n\n5. **Side Information (`sideInfo_t`)**:\n   - Refers to any additional information that may be revealed or inferred during the computations, which might affect the confidentiality guarantees.\n\n6. **API Calls and Responses**:\n   - `apiCall_data`: Represents the structure of data used in API calls.\n   - `apiRes_data`: Represents the structure of data returned from API responses.\n   - `apiCallRes`: An interaction buffer that holds both API calls and responses for processing.\n\n#### Operations\n\n- **API Call Extraction**:\n  - `apiCall(x: apiCallRes)`: Extracts an API call from the interaction buffer, returning an optional `apiCall_data`.\n  \n- **API Response Extraction**:\n  - `apiRes(x: apiCallRes)`: Extracts an API response from the interaction buffer, returning an optional `apiRes_data`.\n\n#### Handle Generation\n\nThe protocol includes a module for handle generation:\n- **Handle Module**:\n  - `create_handle(hdls: svar_t fset)`: Generates a new, fresh handle to store secret values based on existing handles.\n\n#### API Interface\n\nThe API exposes several procedures for interaction:\n- `init()`: Initializes the API engine, preparing it for operations.\n- `nparties()`: Returns the number of parties interacting with the API.\n- `declass(a: svar_t)`: Reveals the secret value of variable `a`, converting it to public while potentially returning side information.\n- `input(a: svar_t, inp: inputs_t)`: Adds an input value to the API's internal storage, managing the confidentiality of the data.\n- `output(a: svar_t)`: Discloses the value of a secret variable `a`, returning it alongside any side information.\n- `sop(sop: sop_t, pargs: public_t list, sargs: svar_t list, result: svar_t)`: Computes a secret operation using public and secret arguments, returning any side information.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe API framework facilitates a secure environment for confidential computations, balancing the need for secrecy with the functionality required for interaction. It allows for structured handling of data while providing mechanisms for input, output, and side information disclosure.\n\n---",

The protocol involves the interaction between a Challenger and an Adversary, with the primary objective of evaluating the security of the encryption mechanism employed.\n\n#### 1. Core Theory Imports\n\nThe protocol begins by importing essential core theory files that define basic constructs such as real numbers, boolean values, and database booleans.\n\n```easycrypt\nrequire import Real Bool DBool.\n```\n\n#### 2. Abstract Data Types\n\nTwo abstract data types are defined:\n\n- `msg`: Represents the message that is to be encrypted.\n- `cip`: Represents the ciphertext produced by the encryption operation.\n\n```easycrypt\ntype msg.\ntype cip.\n```\n\n#### 3. Cryptographic Operations\n\nThe protocol specifies two primary operations:\n\n- `enc`: A function that takes a message and returns its ciphertext.\n- `dec`: A function that takes a ciphertext and returns the original message.\n\n```easycrypt\nop enc: msg -> cip.\nop dec: cip -> msg.\n```\n\n#### 4. Adversary Computation\n\nAn adversary can also perform a computation on the ciphertext, represented by the `comp` operation, which returns a boolean indicating a guess about the ciphertext.\n\n```easycrypt\nop comp: cip -> bool.\n```\n\n#### 5. Module Types\n\nThe protocol defines two module types:\n\n- **Challenger**: This module type includes procedures for encryption and decryption.\n- **Adversary**: This module type includes a procedure for guessing the validity of a ciphertext.\n\n```easycrypt\nmodule type Challenger = {\n  proc encrypt(m:msg): cip\n  proc decrypt(c:cip): msg\n}.\n\nmodule type Adversary = {\n  proc guess(c:cip): bool\n}.\n```\n\n#### 6. Challenger Implementation\n\nAn implementation of the Challenger module, named `C`, is provided. It defines the `encrypt` and `decrypt` procedures that utilize the previously defined operations.\n\n```easycrypt\nmodule C:Challenger = {\n  proc encrypt(m:msg): cip = {\n    return enc(m);\n  }\n  \n  proc decrypt(c:cip): msg = {\n    return dec(c);\n  }\n}.\n```\n\n#### 7. Adversary Implementation\n\nAn implementation of the Adversary module, named `Adv`, is provided, which utilizes the `comp` operation to guess the ciphertext.\n\n```easycrypt\nmodule Adv:Adversary = {\n  proc guess(c:cip): bool = {\n    return comp(c);\n  }\n}.\n```\n\n#### 8. Game Module\n\nThe main game module is defined, encapsulating the logic of the IND-RoR game. It contains a procedure `ind_ror`, which simulates the game by randomly selecting a message and observing the adversary's guess.\n\n```easycrypt\nmodule Game(C:Challenger, Adv:Adversary) = {\n  \n  proc ind_ror(): bool = {\n      var m:msg;\n      var c:cip;\n      var b,b_adv:bool;\n      b <$ {0,1}; (* Pick b uniformly at random. *)\n      if(b=true){\n        (* Set m to be an authentic message. *)\n      } else {\n        (* Set m to be a random string. *)\n      }\n      c <@ C.encrypt(m);\n      b_adv <@ Adv.guess(c);\n      return (b_adv=b);\n  }\n}.\n```\n\n#### 9. Security Claims\n\nFinally, two axioms and a lemma are presented, which relate to the security of the IND-RoR game. The `ind_ror_pr_le1` axiom establishes a probability bound for the game, while the `ind_ror_secure` lemma asserts a security property that maintains a specific probability bound.\n\n```easycrypt\naxiom ind_ror_pr_le1:\nphoare [Game(C,Adv).ind_ror: true ==> res] <= 1%r.\n\nlemma ind_ror_secure:\nphoare [Game(C,Adv).ind_ror: true ==> res] <= (1%r/2%r).\nproof.\n  admit.\nqed.\n```\n\n---",

The protocol provides operations for both encryption and decryption, utilizing various transformations and key schedules to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data.\n\n## Key Operations\n\n### S-Box Operations\n- **Sbox**: A substitution operation that takes an 8-bit word and produces an 8-bit output.\n- **InvSbox**: The inverse of the Sbox operation, allowing for the retrieval of the original 8-bit word from its substituted form. It is axiomatized that applying InvSbox to Sbox returns the original value.\n\n### Word Transformations\n- **SubWord**: Applies the Sbox transformation to each byte of a 32-bit word.\n- **InvSubWord**: Applies the InvSbox transformation to each byte of a 32-bit word. It is proven that applying InvSubWord to SubWord returns the original word.\n\n### State Representation\n- The state in the AES algorithm is represented as a 128-bit word, organized in a 4x4 matrix format.\n- **to_matrix**: Converts a 128-bit state into a column-major matrix representation.\n- **to_state**: Converts a matrix representation back into a 128-bit state.\n\n### Byte Substitution and Row Shifting\n- **SubBytes**: Applies the SubWord operation to each byte of the 128-bit state.\n- **InvSubBytes**: Applies the InvSubWord operation to each byte of the 128-bit state.\n- **ShiftRows**: Shifts each row of the state to the left by a certain number of bytes.\n- **InvShiftRows**: Reverses the ShiftRows operation.\n\n### Column Mixing\n- **MixColumns**: Combines the bytes of each column in the state using linear transformations.\n- **InvMixColumns**: The inverse of MixColumns, allowing for the recovery of the original state before mixing. This operation is axiomatized.\n\n### Key Addition\n- **AddRoundKey**: Performs a bitwise XOR operation between the state and a round key.\n\n## AES Instructions\nThe protocol defines several operations corresponding to the AES encryption and decryption process:\n- **AESENC**: Encrypts the state with a round key by applying the SubBytes, ShiftRows, and MixColumns operations followed by AddRoundKey.\n- **AESENCLAST**: The last encryption step that omits the MixColumns operation.\n- **AESDEC**: Decrypts the state using the inverse operations: InvShiftRows, InvSubBytes, and AddRoundKey, followed by InvMixColumns.\n- **AESDECLAST**: The last decryption step that omits the InvMixColumns operation.\n\n### Key Expansion\n- **AESKEYGENASSIST**: Assists in generating round keys from the current state and a round constant.\n\n## Redefinition of x86 AES Instructions\nThe protocol also includes a redefinition of the x86 AES instructions to align with the standard AES specification. This includes:\n- **AESENC_** and **AESENCLAST_**: Adjustments to the order of operations.\n- **AESDEC_**: Modifications to the decryption process to incorporate InvMixColumns at the end.\n\n## Lemmas and Proofs\nThe protocol includes several lemmas that establish the correctness of the transformations and operations:\n- **InvSubWordK**: Proves that Inverses hold for SubWord and InvSubWord.\n- **ShiftRows_SubBytes**: Shows the commutativity of the ShiftRows and SubBytes operations.\n- **AESDEC_AESDEC_**: Establishes the equivalence of the specified AESDEC operations under certain conditions.\n\n---\n\nThis description encapsulates the main aspects of the protocol, its operations, and its mathematical properties, providing a clear understanding of how the AES algorithm is implemented in the EasyCrypt framework.
