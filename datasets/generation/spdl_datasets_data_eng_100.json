The protocol utilizes public key cryptography to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the messages exchanged among the participants.\n\n#### Roles\n1. **Initiator (I)**: The entity that initiates the protocol by sending a nonce to responder X. The initiator also generates a nonce to be sent to responder Y.\n2. **Responder X (X)**: The first responder that receives the nonce from the initiator, processes it, and sends back a response encrypted with the initiator's public key.\n3. **Responder Y (Y)**: The second responder that receives a nonce from the initiator and sends back a response encrypted with its own public key.\n\n#### Steps of the Protocol\n1. **Nonce Generation**: \n   - The initiator generates two fresh nonces: `nx` for responder X and `ny` for responder Y.\n\n2. **Message Exchange**:\n   - **Step 1**: The initiator sends the nonce `nx` to responder X.\n   - **Step 2**: Responder X receives `nx` and responds with the initiator's identity and the nonce `nx`, both encrypted with the initiator's secret key.\n   - **Step 3**: The initiator sends the nonce `ny` to responder Y.\n   - **Step 4**: Responder Y receives `ny` and responds with the nonce `ny` and the initiator's identity, both encrypted with responder Y's secret key.\n\n3. **Claims**:\n   - The initiator claims non-agreement (Niagree) and non-synchronization (Nisynch) with the responses received.\n\n#### Security Properties\n- **Non-Synchronization (Nisynch)**: Ensures that the initiator does not have to synchronize with the responders for successful communication.\n- **Non-Agreement (Niagree)**: Guarantees that the initiator's agreement on the session context is not compromised by the responders.\n\n---\n\n### SPDL File Generation\nBased on the above description, an SPDL file can be structured to include the necessary roles, message exchanges, and claims, as shown in the original SPDL file provided.",

The primary goal of this protocol is to authenticate the user and securely establish a session using cryptographic techniques.\n\n#### Components\n1. **Cryptographic Functions**:\n   - **Hash Function (`h`)**: A secure hash function used for generating digests of messages.\n   - **XOR Operation**: A binary operation used for combining bits of data securely.\n   - **Concatenation Function**: Used to combine multiple data elements into a single data stream.\n   - **Enforce Function**: Ensures certain security properties or constraints are maintained within the protocol.\n   - **Fresh Function**: Generates fresh values (e.g., nonces) to mitigate replay attacks.\n   - **Role, Capability, Permission, and Priority Functions**: Used to manage user roles and their associated capabilities and permissions within the system.\n\n2. **Secret Keys**:\n   - **`SKa`**: A secret key associated with the role `Da`.\n   - **`Resp`**: A response variable used in the protocol's message exchanges.\n\n3. **Roles**:\n   - **User Role (`Da`)**: Represents the entity requesting access.\n   - **Gateway Role (`GW`)**: Represents the entity validating the request and providing access.\n\n#### Protocol Flow\n1. **Role of `Da` (User)**:\n   - The user generates a fresh nonce (`T1`) to ensure the freshness of the session.\n   - The user constructs a request message (`Rq`) by concatenating their identifier (`IDa`), context (`cxt`), and a constant (`c`).\n   - The message (`M`) sent to the gateway is created by XORing the request message with the hash of the secret key (`h(SKa)`).\n   - The user sends the message (`M`) and nonce (`T1`) to the gateway.\n\n2. **Role of `GW` (Gateway)**:\n   - The gateway receives the message (`M`) and nonce (`T1`) from the user.\n   - It generates its own fresh nonce (`T2`).\n   - The gateway responds to the user by sending a message that includes an XOR of the concatenated identifier, context, response, and the hash of the secret key, along with its nonce (`T2`).\n\n#### Claims\nBoth roles make several claims to establish trust and verify the security properties of the protocol:\n- **`Alive` Claim**: Ensures that both `Da` and `GW` are active participants in the protocol.\n- **`Weakagree`, `Niagree`, `Nisynch` Claims**: These claims ensure that the entities agree on certain values and that their nonces are synchronized.\n- **`Secret` Claim**: Validates that the secret key `SKa` remains confidential and is only known to the user.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe AccessRequest protocol is designed to securely authenticate a user and establish a session with a gateway. It employs cryptographic principles such as nonces, hashing, and secure message construction to protect against replay attacks and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the communication.\n\n---",

This protocol incorporates nonce values to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks, while using a symmetric key shared between the two parties for encryption.\n\n### Key Components\n1. **User Types**:\n   - **SessionKey**: Represents the session key that is established for the communication between the Initiator and Responder.\n\n2. **Constants**:\n   - **Fresh**: A function that denotes the freshness of values.\n   - **Compromised**: A function that indicates if a key has been compromised.\n\n### Protocol Roles\nThe protocol consists of two distinct roles:\n\n#### Role: Initiator (I)\n- **Variables**:\n  - `ni`: A nonce generated by the Initiator.\n  - `nr`, `nr2`: Nonces used in the communication.\n  - `kir`: The session key established during the protocol.\n\n- **Message Flow**:\n  1. **Send Message 1**: The Initiator sends its identity (I) and the nonce (`ni`) encrypted with the session key `k(I,R)` to the Responder.\n  2. **Receive Message 2**: The Initiator receives a message from the Responder containing the nonce (`nr`) and the original nonce (`ni`), both encrypted with the session key.\n  3. **Send Message 3**: The Initiator sends the nonce (`nr`) back to the Responder, encrypted with the session key.\n  4. **Receive Message 4**: The Initiator receives a message from the Responder containing the session key (`kir`), the second nonce (`nr2`), and the original nonce (`ni`), all encrypted with the session key.\n  \n- **Claims**:\n  - Claims the synchronization state (Nisynch).\n  - Claims agreement on nonce values (Niagree).\n  - Claims possession of the established session key (Secret, `kir`).\n  - Claims the freshness of the session key (Empty, (Fresh, `kir`)).\n\n#### Role: Responder (R)\n- **Variables**:\n  - `ni`: A nonce received from the Initiator.\n  - `nr`, `nr2`: Fresh nonces generated by the Responder.\n  - `kir`: A fresh session key established for the communication.\n\n- **Message Flow**:\n  1. **Receive Message 1**: The Responder receives the identity (I) and nonce (`ni`) encrypted with the session key.\n  2. **Send Message 2**: The Responder sends back the original nonce (`ni`) and a new nonce (`nr`) encrypted with the session key to the Initiator.\n  3. **Receive Message 3**: The Responder receives the nonce (`nr`) from the Initiator, encrypted with the session key.\n  4. **Send Message 4**: The Responder sends the newly created session key (`kir`), the second nonce (`nr2`), and the original nonce (`ni`), all encrypted with the session key.\n\n- **Claims**:\n  - Claims the synchronization state (Nisynch).\n  - Claims agreement on nonce values (Niagree).\n  - Claims possession of the established session key (Secret, `kir`).\n  - Claims the freshness of the session key (Empty, (Fresh, `kir`)).\n\n### Security Properties\n- The protocol ensures that both parties can agree on the session key without the risk of compromise, provided that the initial shared key and nonces are kept secure.\n- There are no known attacks against this protocol according to the SPORE library, though the nature of the shared key is modeled such that its properties may not be fully expressible in the current framework.\n\n---",
