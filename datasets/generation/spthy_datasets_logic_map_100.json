    "SPTHY-1/9.spthy": "### Description of the Protocol\n\n#### Purpose\nThe protocol is designed for secure communication among three parties: Alice (A), Bob (B), and a trusted server (S). It allows Alice and Bob to exchange messages securely using both symmetric and asymmetric encryption techniques.\n\n#### Components\n1. **Keys**:\n   - Each participant has a pair of asymmetric keys: a public key (pk) and a private key (sk).\n   - A symmetric key (symK) is established for direct communication between Alice and Bob after initial setup.\n\n2. **Functions**:\n   - `pk/1`: Represents the public key of an entity.\n   - `sk/1`: Represents the secret (private) key of an entity.\n   - `aenc/2`: Represents asymmetric encryption of a message with a public key.\n   - `adec/2`: Represents asymmetric decryption of a message with a private key.\n\n3. **Built-in Functions**:\n   - The protocol utilizes symmetric encryption for the confidentiality of messages.\n\n#### Sequence of Actions\n1. **Key Setup**:\n   - Asymmetric keys are generated for Alice, Bob, and the server.\n   - Public keys are published so that all parties can access them.\n\n2. **Initial Knowledge**:\n   - Each party initializes their state with their own keys and the keys of the other parties.\n\n3. **Message Exchange**:\n   - **Alice to Server (msg1_A)**: Alice sends an encrypted message containing her identity and public key to the server.\n   - **Server to Alice (msg1_S)**: The server receives Alice's message and updates its state.\n   - **Server to Bob (msg2_S)**: The server forwards a message to Bob that includes Alice's identity and a newly generated symmetric key.\n   - **Bob to Server (msg2_B)**: Bob generates a symmetric key and sends it to the server in an encrypted form.\n   - **Server to Bob (msg3_S)**: The server sends back the encrypted symmetric key to Bob.\n   - **Bob to Alice (msg4_B)**: Bob sends a message back to Alice that is encrypted with Alice\u2019s public key, which includes a secret message.\n\n4. **Security Properties**:\n   - The protocol ensures secrecy, meaning that if a secret is established, it cannot be revealed by any party without the appropriate keys.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe described protocol establishes a secure communication channel between Alice and Bob with the help of a trusted server, utilizing both asymmetric and symmetric encryption methods. The various states and message exchanges ensure that the participants can securely share information without exposing their private keys or the contents of their communications.\n\n### Corresponding Tamarin spthy File Structure\nBased on the above description, the spthy file structure provided initially is appropriate and correctly defines the roles, rules, and actions that implement the described protocol.",
    "SPTHY-1/ake_KEAplus.spthy": "---\n\n### KEA+ Protocol Description\n\n**Protocol Name**: KEA+  \n**Modelers**: Jannik Dreier, Ralf Sasse  \n**Date**: April 2015  \n**Source**: Lauter, Mityagin, 2006  \n**Property**: Key indistinguishable from randomness  \n**Status**: (To be determined)\n\n#### Overview\nKEA+ is a key exchange protocol that allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. The protocol is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism and incorporates additional security measures to ensure that the keys generated are indistinguishable from random values.\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **Functions**:\n   - `h/1`: A cryptographic hash function used to generate keys from given inputs.\n   - `g/0`: A generator for the Diffie-Hellman group used in the protocol.\n\n2. **Long-term Keypair Generation**:\n   - Each participant generates a long-term public/private key pair. The public key is derived from the private key using the generator.\n\n3. **Initiator**:\n   - **Step 1**: The initiator generates a session key using their ephemeral secret and sends it along with their identity and the public key of the responder to the responder.\n   - **Step 2**: The initiator computes a derived key based on the public key received from the responder and their long-term key.\n\n4. **Responder**:\n   - **Step 1**: The responder receives the initiator's message, extracts the necessary information, and computes their own session key.\n   - **Step 2**: The responder sends their ephemeral public key along with their computed session key back to the initiator.\n\n#### Protocol Rules\n- **Long-term Key Generation**: Each participant generates a long-term key pair and outputs their public key.\n- **Initiation Phase**: The initiator sends a message to the responder containing their information and the computed session key.\n- **Response Phase**: The responder processes the initiator's message, computes their session key, and sends a response back to the initiator.\n  \n#### Restrictions and Properties\n- **One Key per Name**: A restriction is placed to ensure that each participant has a unique long-term key.\n- **Key Initialization and Response**: The protocol ensures that both parties successfully derive and agree on the session key.\n\n#### Security Lemmas\n- The protocol guarantees that there exists a trace in which both the key initialization by the initiator and the key response by the responder can be observed, ensuring that the keys are established.\n\n### Additional Notes\n- The protocol is designed to prevent key compromise and ensure that the generated keys are secure.\n- The key exchange is modeled within the eCK (extended Canetti-Krawczyk) framework to evaluate its security properties.\n\n---",
    "SPTHY-1/ake_NAXOS.spthy": "---\n\n### Protocol Description: NAXOS\n\n#### Overview\nThe NAXOS protocol is an authenticated key exchange protocol designed to ensure that the keys used for communication are indistinguishable from random values. This property is crucial for maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged keys, thus providing a secure channel for communication between parties.\n\n#### Authors and Source\n- **Modelers:** Jannik Dreier, Ralf Sasse\n- **Trace-Version Contributors:** Cas Cremers, Benedikt Schmidt\n- **Date:** January 2012 / April 2012\n- **Source:** \"Stronger Security of Authenticated Key Exchange\" by LaMacchia, Lauter, Mityagin, 2007\n\n#### Security Properties\nThe NAXOS protocol aims to achieve the following security properties:\n- **Key Indistinguishability from Randomness:** The keys generated during the exchange should not be distinguishable from random values, ensuring their secrecy and security.\n- **Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS):** Even if a long-term key is compromised in the future, past session keys remain secure.\n\n#### Protocol Steps\n1. **Key Generation:**\n   - Each party generates a long-term key pair consisting of a private key (lk) and a corresponding public key (pk).\n   - The public key is derived from the private key using a generator `g`.\n\n2. **Initiator's Actions:**\n   - The initiator (I) generates an ephemeral secret key (eskI) and computes a hash value (exI) using a function `h1`.\n   - The initiator sends an initial message containing its ephemeral key and public key to the responder (R).\n\n3. **Responder's Actions:**\n   - Upon receiving the initiator's message, the responder (R) also generates its ephemeral secret key (eskR) and computes a corresponding hash (exR).\n   - The responder then computes a session key (kR) based on received values and sends back a response.\n\n4. **Session Key Establishment:**\n   - Both the initiator and responder compute their respective session keys (kI and kR) using hash functions (h2) based on exchanged values.\n   - The keys are registered for future use in secure communication.\n\n#### Rules and Constraints\n- **Long-term Key Pair Generation:** Each party generates a long-term key pair and registers their public keys.\n- **Session Management:** The initiator and responder keep track of session identifiers to match and verify the sessions.\n- **Restrictions:** The protocol ensures that each party registers at most one public key, preventing key collisions.\n\n#### Security Lemmas\n- **Session Key Consistency Lemma:** If two matching sessions accept different keys, it violates the security of the protocol.\n- **Forward Secrecy Lemma:** If a test session is compromised, certain conditions must be met regarding key reveals to maintain security.\n\n---"
