The protocol seems to involve three entities: two parties (A and B) and a server (S). The protocol involves the exchange of encrypted and signed messages, and there is also an attacker who can interact with the system.\n\nHere's a description of the protocol:\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\nThe protocol involves three main entities: Party A (sA), Party B (sB), and a Server (sS). The entities communicate using public key encryption, digital signatures, and a special encryption function `sencrypt`. The protocol is structured as follows:\n\n**Initialization:**\n1. Each entity (A, B, and S) has a public key (pk) that is known to the system.\n2. The system initializes with the public keys of A, B, and S.\n\n**Attacker Capabilities:**\n1. The attacker can obtain the plaintext of an encrypted message if they know the secret key.\n2. The attacker can obtain the public key of any entity.\n3. The attacker can encrypt any message using any public key.\n4. The attacker can forge signatures.\n5. The attacker can use the `sencrypt` function with any input.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n**Entity A (sA):**\n1. A generates a signature of a tuple containing its host identifier and its public key, signed by S.\n2. A also generates a signature of a tuple containing the host identifier of another entity (x) and its public key (pkx), signed by S.\n3. A encrypts the signature of the key shared with entity x (k[pkx]) using x's public key and sends this encrypted message.\n\n**Entity B (sB):**\n1. B receives a message that includes a signature of a tuple containing the host identifier of A (sA) and its public key (s1), and a signature of a tuple containing the host identifier of B (sB) and its public key (sB), both signed by S.\n2. B also receives an encrypted message containing a signature of a shared key (k) signed by s1.\n3. B then uses the `sencrypt` function with a secret and the shared key to generate a new encrypted message.\n\n**Server (sS):**\n1. The server receives the host identifiers of two entities (s1 and s2).\n2. The server generates a signature of a tuple containing each host identifier and its public key, signed by S.\n\n**Security Goal:**\nThe protocol aims to ensure that the secret (secret[]) is reachable, meaning that there exists a valid execution path in the protocol where the secret can be obtained.\n\n---\n\nBased on this description, we can create the corresponding horn file.

The protocol utilizes encryption and decryption functions (`enc` and `dec`), exponentiation (`exp`), and modular arithmetic (`mod`). The goal of the protocol is to securely exchange a message `objective` which is a private bitstring.\n\n**Initial Setup:**\n- Entity A generates three new bitstrings: `P`, `G`, and `Na`.\n- Entity B generates a new bitstring `Nb`.\n\n**Entity A's Actions:**\n1. A sends `P` and `G` to B over the channel `c`.\n2. A computes the value of `G` raised to the power of `Na`, then takes the result modulo `P`, and sends this value to B.\n3. A waits to receive a message `B` from B over the channel `c`.\n4. Upon receiving `B`, A computes the value of `B` raised to the power of `Na`, then takes the result modulo `P`, and uses this value `s` as the symmetric key to encrypt the `objective` using the encryption function `enc`. The encrypted message is then sent to B.\n\n**Entity B's Actions:**\n1. B waits to receive the pair `(P, G)` from A over the channel `c`.\n2. B waits to receive a message `A` from A over the channel `c`.\n3. B computes the value of `G` raised to the power of `Nb`, then takes the result modulo `P`, and sends this value to A.\n4. B computes the value of `A` raised to the power of `Nb`, then takes the result modulo `P`. However, the protocol description seems to be incomplete or incorrect here, as it simply states `let s = mod(exp(A, Nb), P) in 0.` which does not align with standard cryptographic protocol behavior. It is expected that B would use this value to decrypt a received message, but there is no decryption action or further message exchange described in the provided code.\n\n**Security Concerns:**\n- The protocol does not include any mechanism for authenticating the participants or the messages, which could lead to man-in-the-middle attacks.\n- The protocol description for B's actions is incomplete and seems to contain an error, as B does not perform any decryption and the final `0` does not correspond to any meaningful action in a cryptographic protocol.\n\nTo generate a corresponding pv file from this description, we would need to create a new pv file with the described entities, actions, and the encryption/decryption primitives.

These keys are stored in a table.\n\n2. **Initiator (Host A or B):**\n   - The initiator (let's say A) generates a fresh nonce `Na` and a fresh session identifier `C`.\n   - A sends a message to the responder (B) containing `C`, `A`, `B`, and the tuple `(Na, C, A, B)` encrypted with the key `kA` that A shares with the server.\n\n3. **Responder (Host B or A):**\n   - The responder receives the message from the initiator.\n   - The responder generates a fresh nonce `Nb` and sends a message to the server containing `C`, `A`, `B`, the previously received encrypted message, and the tuple `(Nb, C, A, B)` encrypted with the key `kB` that B shares with the server.\n\n4. **Server (S):**\n   - The server receives the message from the responder.\n   - The server decrypts the messages with the respective keys of A and B to obtain `Na` and `Nb`.\n   - The server generates a new session key `k` and sends a message to the responder containing `C`, `Na` encrypted with `kA`, and `Nb` encrypted with `kB`.\n\n5. **Responder (Host B or A):**\n   - The responder receives the message from the server, decrypts it to obtain the session key `k`, and sends a message to the initiator containing `C` and the session key `k` encrypted with the session key `k`.\n\n6. **Initiator (Host A or B):**\n   - The initiator receives the message from the responder, decrypts it to obtain the session key `k`, and can now use this key to establish a secure communication channel with the responder.\n\n### Protocol PV File Description\n\nThe provided PV file contains the following elements:\n\n- **Type Definitions:**\n  - `key` for cryptographic keys.\n  - `host` for host identifiers.\n  - `nonce` for nonces (random values used once).\n\n- **Function Definitions:**\n  - `encrypt` for encryption, assuming that decryption is the inverse of encryption.\n\n- **Secrecy Assumptions:**\n  - The attacker does not have access to new keys `Kas` and `Kbs`.\n\n- **Host Identifiers:**\n  - `A` and `B` are the two hosts participating in the protocol.\n\n- **Key Table:**\n  - `keys` is a table mapping hosts to their shared keys with the server.\n\n- **Process Definitions:**\n  - `processInitiator` for the behavior of the initiator.\n  - `processResponder` for the behavior of the responder.\n  - `processS` for the behavior of the server.\n  - `processK` for the process of key registration.\n  \n- **Main Process:**\n  - The main process initializes the shared keys between the server and the hosts, and then starts an unbounded number of sessions for each role (initiator, responder, server, and key registration).\n\n### Expected Results\n\nThe protocol is analyzed for non-interference properties, specifically that the secrets `secretA` and `secretB` are not influenced by the attacker's actions. The expected results indicate that non-interference for `secretA` and `secretB` individually is true, but non-interference for both secrets together cannot be proved.\n\nThis description should provide enough information to create a corresponding PV file that can be run by ProVerif.

It involves two participants, A and B, who wish to establish a shared secret key. The protocol uses a combination of public key cryptography, symmetric encryption, hash functions, and a Diffie-Hellman-like key exchange mechanism. Here's a step-by-step description:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Both participants A and B generate their own public and private key pairs. A generates `skA` and `pkA`, while B generates `skB` and `pkB`.\n   - These public keys (`pkA` and `pkB`) are then sent to the other party through an insecure channel `c`.\n\n2. **Process A (Initiator):**\n   - A receives the public key `pkX` (which should be `pkB`) from B.\n   - A generates a random value `x` and a fresh symmetric key `Ka`.\n   - A computes the encryption of a tuple containing `pkA` and `Ka` using `pkX` and sends it along with `g(x)` to B.\n   - A receives a message `(m1, m2, m3)` from B.\n   - A decrypts `m1` with its private key `skA` to obtain `Kb`.\n   - A computes `K0` by hashing the concatenation of `Ka` and `Kb`.\n   - A checks if `m3` matches the keyed hash of `(g(x), m2, pkX, pkA)` using `K0`.\n   - If the check passes, A computes a shared value `sh` by hashing `f(x, m2)` and sends a keyed hash of `(m2, g(x), pkA, pkX)` using `K0`.\n   - If `pkX` matches `pkB`, A encrypts `secretA` with `sh` using symmetric encryption and sends it to B.\n\n3. **Process B (Responder):**\n   - B receives a message `(m1, m2)` from A.\n   - B decrypts `m1` with its private key `skB` to obtain `pkAr` and `Ka`.\n   - B generates a fresh symmetric key `Kb` and a random value `y`.\n   - B computes a shared value `sh` by hashing `f(y, m2)`.\n   - B sends a message that includes the encryption of `Kb` with `pkAr`, `g(y)`, and a keyed hash of `(m2, g(y), pkB, pkAr)` using `K0`.\n   - B receives a message `m3` from A.\n   - B checks if `m3` matches the keyed hash of `(g(y), m2, pkAr, pkB)` using `K0`.\n   - If the check passes and `pkAr` matches `pkA`, B encrypts `secretB` with `sh` using symmetric encryption and sends it to A.\n\n**Security Assumptions:**\n- The protocol assumes that the public keys can be safely exchanged over an insecure channel without being tampered with or intercepted.\n- The protocol assumes the secrecy of the private keys `skA` and `skB`.\n- It also assumes that the functions `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `hash`, `keyhash`, `f`, and `g` are secure and that the `sencrypt` and `sdecrypt` functions provide secure symmetric encryption.\n\n**Proverif Requirements:**\n- The protocol description should include all the functions and their properties (e.g., `encrypt`, `decrypt`, `hash`, `keyhash`, `f`, `g`, `sencrypt`, `sdecrypt`).\n- It should define the initial public keys and the private keys, as well as the non-interference properties for `secretA` and `secretB`.\n- The description should include the processes for A and B, as well as the initial setup where the public keys are output to the channel.\n\nPlease note that this is a high-level description of the protocol.

It uses public key encryption, a hash function, and a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. The protocol is designed to resist certain types of attacks, such as man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n#### Initialization\n- Party A generates its own secret key (`skA`) and corresponding public key (`pkA`).\n- Party B generates its own secret key (`skB`) and corresponding public key (`pkB`).\n- Both parties publish their public keys (`pkA` and `pkB`) on a channel.\n\n#### Key Exchange\n- **Party A**:\n  1. A receives a public key (`pkX`) from the channel.\n  2. A generates a random exponent `x` and computes `gx` using the Diffie-Hellman function.\n  3. A generates a nonce `Ka` and encrypts `(pkA, Ka)` using `pkX`.\n  4. A sends the encrypted message and `gx` to B.\n  5. A receives a message `(m1, m2, m3)` from B.\n  6. A decrypts `m1` using its secret key to obtain `Kb`.\n  7. A computes `K0` as the hash of `(Ka, Kb)`.\n  8. If `m3` matches the keyed hash of `(gx, m2, pkX, pkA)` using `K0`, A computes `sh` as the hash of `exp(m2, x)`.\n  9. A sends a keyed hash of `(m2, gx, pkA, pkX)` using `K0`.\n  10. If `pkX` is equal to `pkB`, A encrypts the secret `secretA` using `sh` and sends it.\n\n- **Party B**:\n  1. B receives an encrypted message `(m1, m2)` from the channel.\n  2. B decrypts `m1` using its secret key to obtain `(pkAr, Ka)`.\n  3. B generates a nonce `Kb`.\n  4. B computes `K0` as the hash of `(Ka, Kb)`.\n  5. B generates a random exponent `y` and computes `gy` using the Diffie-Hellman function.\n  6. B computes `sh` as the hash of `exp(m2, y)`.\n  7. B sends an encrypted message of `Kb` using `pkAr`, along with `gy` and a keyed hash of `(m2, gy, pkB, pkAr)` using `K0`.\n  8. B receives a message `m3` from A.\n  9. If `m3` matches the keyed hash of `(gy, m2, pkAr, pkB)` using `K0`, and if `pkAr` is equal to `pkA`, B encrypts the secret `secretB` using `sh` and sends it.\n\n#### Security Assumptions\n- The protocol assumes that the secrets `skA`, `skB`, and `x` are not known to the attacker.\n- The protocol assumes that the nonces `Ka` and `Kb` are fresh and not reused.\n- The protocol assumes that the hash function is secure.\n\n#### Security Properties\n- The protocol aims to ensure that the secrets `secretA` and `secretB` are not leaked to the attacker, even in the presence of an active attacker who can manipulate the communication channel.\n\n### Corresponding ProVerif (pv) File Content\n\nBased on the description above, the provided pv file already captures the essence of the protocol.

Initiator (A)\n2. Responder (B)\n3. Server (S)\n\n#### Initial Setup:\n- Each participant has a public key and a secret key.\n- A table of host names and their corresponding public keys is maintained.\n\n#### Protocol Steps:\n\n**Initiator (A) Actions:**\n1. The Initiator starts by sending its identity (xA) to the Responder (B).\n2. A nonce (n) is received from the Responder.\n3. The Initiator signs the nonce with its secret key and sends the signed nonce back to the Responder.\n\n**Responder (B) Actions:**\n1. The Responder receives the Initiator's identity (xA) and generates a nonce (n).\n2. The Responder sends the nonce to the Initiator.\n3. The Responder receives a signed message from the Initiator.\n4. The Responder checks the signature using the Initiator's public key.\n5. If the signature is valid, the Responder sends the Initiator's identity to the Server (S).\n\n**Server (S) Actions:**\n1. The Server receives the Initiator's identity (xA).\n2. The Server retrieves the Initiator's public key from the key table.\n3. The Server sends the Initiator's identity and a signed message (containing the Initiator's identity and public key) back to the Responder.\n\n#### Security Assumptions:\n- The secret keys (skA, skB, skS) are not known to the attacker.\n- The public keys (pkA, pkB, pkS) are registered in the key table and are used for signature verification.\n\n#### Events:\n- `beginBparam(xA, xB)`: The Responder starts the protocol with the Initiator.\n- `endBparam(xA, xB)`: The Responder finishes the first part of the protocol with the Initiator.\n- `beginBfull(xA, xB, n)`: The Responder starts the full protocol with the Initiator, including the nonce.\n- `endBfull(xA, xB, n)`: The Responder finishes the full protocol with the Initiator, including the nonce.\n\n#### Queries:\n- There are queries to ensure that the `beginBparam` and `endBparam` events are properly correlated, and similarly for `beginBfull` and `endBfull`.\n\n#### Process Initialization:\n- The protocol starts with the generation of secret keys for A, B, and S, and their corresponding public keys.\n- The public keys are output and registered in the key table.\n- The protocol processes for the Initiator, Responder, and Server are started concurrently.\n\n### Notes:\n- The protocol description does not mention B as a sender in the original messages, which might lead to a potential attack as noted in the comments.\n- The protocol assumes that the attacker cannot forge signatures or learn secret keys.\n\nBased on this description, you can now generate the corresponding pv file for ProVerif.

The encrypted message is then sent to the server.\n\n4. **Message 3 (Server to Initiator):**\n   - The server S decrypts the message from B using the shared key `Kbs`. It then retrieves A's shared key `Kas` and encrypts B's identity, a new session key `Kab`, nonce `Na`, and nonce `Nb` using `Kas`. It also encrypts A's identity and the session key `Kab` using `Kbs`. Both encrypted messages are sent to A.\n\n5. **Message 4 (Initiator to Responder):**\n   - Host A decrypts the first message from S using `Kas` to obtain B's identity, `Kab`, `Na`, and `Nb`. It then sends an encrypted message to B containing A's identity and `Kab` using `Kbs`, and an encrypted nonce `Nb` using `Kab`.\n\n6. **Establishment of Secure Channel:**\n   - Host B decrypts the message from A using `Kbs` to obtain A's identity and `Kab`. It then verifies that the decrypted nonce `Nb` matches the one it originally sent to the server. If the verification is successful, B considers the session key `Kab` as established and sends an encrypted message to A containing the session key `Kab`.\n\n**Secrecy Assumptions:**\n- The shared keys `Kas` and `Kbs` between the server and the hosts A and B, respectively, are not known to the attacker.\n\n**Roles and Processes:**\n- **Initiator Role:** The role of the host A (initiator) is to start the protocol by sending the first message and handling the subsequent messages to establish a secure channel.\n- **Responder Role:** The role of the host B (responder) is to receive the first message, interact with the server, and establish a secure channel with A.\n- **Server Role:** The server S is responsible for facilitating the secure channel establishment between A and B by generating and distributing the session key `Kab`.\n- **Key Registration Process:** A process to register keys for hosts with the server.\n\n**ProVerif Analysis:**\n- The provided pv file includes a ProVerif analysis to check for non-interference properties of the secrets `secretA` and `secretB`. The analysis results indicate that non-interference cannot be proved for `secretA` and `secretB` as a whole, but non-interference holds for each secret individually.\n\nThis description should be sufficient to generate a corresponding pv file for the Yahalom protocol that can be run by ProVerif."]]}, "PV-1/piyahalom.pi": {"code": [[false, "To add notations to the given pi file without changing the original content, we can include comments within the existing code.

The goal is to establish a secure communication channel between A and B with the help of S, using shared keys for encryption. The protocol ensures that both A and B agree on a session key `K_ab` but does not necessarily agree on the nonces `N_A` and `N_B`.\n\n#### Steps of the Protocol\n\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - A generates a nonce `N_A` and sends it along with its identity to B.\n   \n2. **B to Server**:\n   - B receives the message from A and sends its identity, a nonce `N_B`, and the message from A (encrypted with B's shared key with the server `K_bs`) to the server S.\n\n3. **Server to A**:\n   - The server S processes the message from B, extracts A's identity and nonce `N_A`, and generates a session key `K_ab`. It then sends a message to A containing `N_B`, the session key `K_ab` encrypted with A's shared key with the server `K_as`, and a message with A's identity, `K_ab`, and `N_B` encrypted with B's shared key `K_bs`.\n\n4. **A to B**:\n   - A receives the message from S, decrypts it, and if the nonce `N_B` matches, sends a message to B containing the session key `K_ab` encrypted with B's shared key `K_bs` and `N_B` encrypted with the new session key `K_ab`.\n\n5. **B to Server**:\n   - B receives the message from A, decrypts it, and if the nonce `N_B` matches, it concludes the protocol successfully.\n\n#### Entities and Their Roles\n\n- **Entity A (Initiator)**:\n  - Generates `N_A`.\n  - Sends `N_A` and its identity to B.\n  - Receives `N_B` and session key `K_ab` from S.\n  - Sends `K_ab` and `N_B` to B.\n  - Optionally sends a secret `secretA` encrypted with `K_ab` to B.\n\n- **Entity B (Participant)**:\n  - Receives `N_A` and A's identity from A.\n  - Generates `N_B`.\n  - Sends `N_B` and the message from A to S.\n  - Receives `K_ab` and `N_B` from S.\n  - Sends `K_ab` and `N_B` to A.\n  - Optionally sends a secret `secretB` encrypted with `K_ab` to A.\n\n- **Entity S (Server)**:\n  - Receives `N_B` and the message from B.\n  - Processes the message to extract A's identity and nonce.\n  - Generates `K_ab`.\n  - Sends `N_B`, `K_ab` encrypted with A's key, and `K_ab` encrypted with B's key to A.\n\n#### Security Assumptions\n\n- The shared keys between A and S (`K_as`), B and S (`K_bs`), and A and B (`K_ab`) are kept secret.\n- The protocol assumes that the attacker cannot forge these keys or decrypt messages encrypted with these keys.\n\n#### Expected Results\n\n- The protocol should ensure that the attacker does not learn the secrets `secretA` or `secretB`.\n- The protocol should ensure that the initial and final parameters are correctly logged by the entities.\n\nThis description should provide enough information to generate a corresponding pi file that can be run by ProVerif.

The protocol involves three entities: A, B, and a server S, each with their own secret keys (`sA`, `sB`, and `sS` respectively). The protocol also involves the use of public keys, encryption, signing, and a special encryption function (`sencrypt`) that uses a shared key (`k`). Below is the description content of the protocol:\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nThe protocol involves three entities: A (entity A), B (entity B), and a server S (server). Each entity has a secret key (`sA`, `sB`, and `sS` respectively), and there is a shared key `k` that is used for a special encryption function. The protocol uses standard public key encryption and digital signatures.\n\n**Initialization:**\n- Each entity A, B, and S generates a public key (`pk(sA)`, `pk(sB)`, and `pk(sS)`) from their respective secret keys.\n- These public keys are committed to the system and are considered common knowledge.\n\n**Attacker Model:**\n- The attacker can compute the plaintext from the ciphertext if they know the secret key used for encryption.\n- The attacker can deduce the public key from the secret key.\n- The attacker can compute the ciphertext from the plaintext and the public key.\n- The attacker can forge a signature if they know the secret key used for signing.\n- The attacker can compute the result of the special encryption function if they know the shared key.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Entity A's Action:**\n   - Entity A signs a tuple containing its host identity and its public key using the server's secret key (`sS`).\n   - Entity A signs a tuple containing the host identity and public key of another entity (not necessarily A) using the server's secret key (`sS`).\n   - Entity A encrypts a signature of the bitstring representation of the shared key `k` (converted to a bitstring using the `key_to_bitstring` function) and its secret key (`sA`) using the public key of the other entity.\n   - The result is a tuple containing the two signatures and the encrypted signature.\n\n2. **Entity B's Action:**\n   - Entity B receives a tuple containing a signature of a tuple with the host identity and public key of entity A and another entity, and a signature of the host identity and public key of entity B, both signed by the server.\n   - Entity B also receives a ciphertext, which is the encryption of a signature of the bitstring representation of the shared key `k` and the secret key of the other entity, encrypted with entity B's public key.\n   - Entity B uses the shared key `k` to decrypt the ciphertext and obtain the secret information.\n\n3. **Server's Action:**\n   - The server signs the host identities of entities A and B along with their respective public keys using the server's secret key (`sS`).\n\n**Security Goals:**\n- The protocol aims to ensure that the shared secret `k` remains confidential and that only the intended participants can compute it.\n- The protocol also aims to ensure that the host identities and public keys of the entities are correctly authenticated by the server's signature.\n\n---\n\nBased on this description, one could generate a corresponding horntype file that captures the protocol's structure and security properties.

If it does, the authentication is successful, and the function returns `0`.\n\n4. **Adversary Model:**\n   - The protocol includes an adversarial model where the adversary can interact with the system as any host. However, the adversary does not share secrets with the legitimate hosts.\n\n5. **Equations and Reductions:**\n   - The protocol specifies symmetric encryption (`enc` and `dec`) and symmetric encryption with known success (`senc` and `sdec`).\n   - There are equations that state that encryption followed by decryption with the same key will result in the original message, and vice versa.\n   - Public key encryption (`penc`) and decryption (`pdec`) are also defined, with a reduction stating that decrypting a public key-encrypted message with the corresponding private key will yield the original message.\n\n6. **Protocol Execution:**\n   - The protocol is executed with multiple processes running concurrently, including `processA` and `processB` for both `hostA` and `hostB` communicating with each other using the shared passwords `PAA`, `PAB`, and `PBB`.\n   - There is also a phase where an adversarial action can occur, where a new password `w` is generated, and the adversary can choose between `w` and `PAB`.\n\nThis description provides a high-level overview of the protocol.

This description will outline the actions and entities involved in the protocol, and the rules that dictate the interactions between them. Please note that the horn file provided uses a specific syntax and abbreviations that are typical for ProVerif, and the following description will attempt to interpret these elements in a more human-readable form.\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n**Entities:**\n- `skA[]`: The private key of entity A.\n- `skB[]`: The private key of entity B.\n- `pk(skX[])`: The public key corresponding to the private key `skX[]` of an entity X.\n\n**Actions:**\n- `encrypt(m, pk(skX))`: Encrypting message `m` using the public key of entity X.\n- `begin(Na[v3,v4], pk(skA[]), v3, v5)`: An initial step involving a value `Na[v3,v4]` (which seems to be a nonce), the public key of A, and other values `v3` and `v5`.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. The protocol starts with an action labeled `begin`.\n2. An encrypted message is constructed with `Nb[encrypt((v9, pk(skA[])), pk(skB[])), v10]`, which is then encrypted with the public key of B (`pk(skB[])`). If this is the case and we have the original encrypted message `(v9, pk(skA[]))` encrypted with the public key of B, the protocol transitions to an `end` state with the values `v10` and the tuple `(v9, pk(skA[]), pk(skB[]), Nb[encrypt((v9, pk(skA[])), pk(skB[])), v10])`.\n3. If there is a message `(v6, v7)` encrypted with the public key of B, then this message can be transformed into a new message that includes an encryption of the original message with an additional value `Nb[encrypt((v6, v7), pk(skB[])), v8]`.\n4. When the protocol reaches a `begin` state with certain values, and there is an encryption of these values with the public key of A, then a transition can be made to encrypt the value `v5` with `v3`.\n5. If there is a message `v1`, it can be transformed into a new message that includes `Na[v1, v2]` encrypted with the public key of A, followed by the value `v1`.\n6. There are rules indicating that public keys `pk(skB[])` and `pk(skA[])` are present in the system.\n7. If there is a message `x` encrypted with the public key of `y`, then the content `x` can be retrieved.\n8. If there is any value `any3`, it can be replaced by its public key.\n9. If there are two values `any2` and `any1`, their encryption can be represented as a new message.\n\nPlease note that this description is based on the horn file syntax and the given rules. The actual protocol's semantics might require more context about what each variable represents and how they are used within the protocol's logic. The horn file includes functions, predicates, and rules that would need to be translated back into a formal representation for ProVerif to analyze. However, the above description should provide a general overview of the protocol's structure. \n\nIf you need a corresponding horn file based on this description, please provide more specific details about the protocol's intended behavior, as the horn file requires precise syntax and a formal structure that captures all the intricacies of the protocol's logic."]]}, "PV-1/NeedhamSchroederSK.pv": {"code": [[false, "To add notations to the provided ProVerif (pv) file without changing the original code and ensuring that the added notations are semantically correct, we can add comments and use the `(* ... *)` syntax to explain sections of the code.

The server inserts the public keys of clients A and B into a table of keys.\n\n2. **Client A's Actions**:\n   - Client A generates a fresh nonce Na.\n   - Client A sends a message containing its identity A and the identity of the intended recipient I to the server.\n   - Client A receives the signed public key of I (sign_I_pkI) from the server and verifies it using the server's public key.\n   - Client A encrypts the nonce Na and its identity A using the public key of I (aenc((Na, A), pkI)) and sends it to the server.\n   - Client A receives an encrypted message (aenc_Na_Ni_I) from the server and decrypts it using its secret key to obtain the nonce Na and the identity of client B (Ni).\n   - Client A encrypts Ni using the public key of I and sends it to the server.\n\n3. **Client B's Actions**:\n   - Client B generates a fresh nonce Nb.\n   - Client B sends a message containing its identity B and the identity of the intended recipient A to the server.\n   - Client B receives the signed public key of A (sign_A_pkA) from the server and verifies it using the server's public key.\n   - Client B receives an encrypted message (aenc_Na_A) from the server and decrypts it using its secret key to obtain the nonce Na and the identity A.\n   - Client B encrypts a message containing Na, Nb, and its identity B using A's public key and sends it to the server.\n   - Client B receives an encrypted message (aenc_Nb) from the server and decrypts it using its secret key to obtain Nb.\n\n4. **Server's Actions**:\n   - The server can act as a key retrieval server, receiving a request for the public key of a destination entity and responding with the signed public key of that entity.\n   - The server can also act as a key register server, receiving a registration of a new host and its public key, and adding it to the keys table if the host is not A or B.\n\nThe objective of the protocol is to securely establish a shared secret between clients A and B with the help of the server, ensuring that the communication between them is confidential and authenticated."]]}, "PV-1/piwoolampk.pi": {"code": [[false, "To add notations to the provided pi file for ProVerif, we should keep in mind that we want to add comments or annotations that do not alter the semantics of the code.

Below is a human-readable description of the protocol based on the given code:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Initial Setup\n- Each participant (A, B, and S) has a host name and a private key associated with it. The public keys can be derived from the private keys.\n- The protocol starts with the initialization of the private keys `skA`, `skB`, and `skS` for participants A, B, and S, respectively.\n\n#### Process A (Initiator)\n1. A chooses the host B with which to communicate by receiving an initial message `hostB0`.\n2. A starts the protocol by sending its host name `hostA` to B.\n3. A receives a nonce `n` from B.\n4. A signs the tuple `(hostA, hostB, n)` with its private key `skA` and sends the signature to B.\n\n#### Process B (Responder)\n1. B receives the host name `hostA0` from A.\n2. B generates a nonce `n` and sends it to A.\n3. B receives a message `m` from A, which is expected to be the signed tuple `(hostA, hostB, n)`.\n4. B sends its host name `hostA0` to S for verification.\n5. B receives a message from S, which includes `hostA` and the signed tuple `(hostA, pkA)` using S's private key `skS`.\n6. B verifies the signature using S's public key `pkS` and then verifies the signature of the tuple `(hostA, hostB, n)` using A's public key `pkA2`.\n7. If the verification is successful and `hostA0` matches the host name received from A, B triggers two events: `endBparam(hostB)` and `endBfull(hostA0, n, hostB)`.\n\n#### Process S (Server)\n1. S receives the host name `hostA` from B.\n2. S sends a message back to B that includes `hostA` and the signed tuple `(hostA, getkey(hostA))` using S's private key `skS`.\n\n#### Final Steps\n- The public keys of A, B, and S are outputted along with their corresponding host names.\n- The processes for A, B, and S are run concurrently.\n\n### Security Assumptions\n- The private keys `skA`, `skB`, and `skS` are assumed to be secret.\n- There are queries to check if the events `beginBparam` and `beginBfull` are correctly paired with their corresponding `endBparam` and `endBfull` events.\n\n### Verification Queries\n- The protocol is checked to ensure that the events `endBparam(x)` imply `beginBparam(x)` and `endBfull(x,y,z)` imply `beginBfull(x,y,z)`.\n\nThis description should be sufficient to generate a corresponding pi file for the ProVerif tool.

Below is a description of the protocol based on the provided pv file:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Entities and Channels\n- **Entities**: Client, RDP (Proxy), Organization, Affiliate\n- **Channels**:\n  - `cout`: Output channel from the client to the RDP.\n  - `cin`: Input channel from the RDP to the client.\n  - `orgin`: Output channel from the RDP to the organization.\n  - `orgout`: Input channel from the organization to the RDP.\n  - `affin`: Output channel from the RDP to the affiliate.\n  - `affout`: Input channel from the affiliate to the RDP.\n  - `pub`: Public channel used by the affiliate to publish received names.\n\n#### Types and Constants\n- `Name`: A type representing the names of clients and organizations.\n- `OK` and `notOK`: Bitstrings used to indicate successful or unsuccessful operations.\n- `nN`: A special name indicating no policy is found for a client.\n- `nO`: A special bitstring indicating no policy is found for an operation.\n- `validName` and `invalidName`: Private names indicating whether a client is authorized to perform operations.\n\n#### Events\n- `clientSendName(bitstring)`: Event emitted when a client sends a name and operation.\n- `clientReceiveResponse(bitstring)`: Event emitted after a client receives a response.\n- `orgOK(bitstring)`: Event emitted when the organization receives a message to return policy.\n- `affReceivesMsg(bitstring)`: Event emitted if the affiliate accepts a message.\n- `rdpWasSuccessful(bitstring)`: Event emitted if the RDP receives an answer for an orgOK request from the affiliate.\n\n#### Protocol Steps\n1. **Client Request**:\n   - The client generates a session ID (`nonce`).\n   - The client sends a message (`m0`) containing the client's name, operation, and nonce to the RDP using the `cout` channel.\n   - The client waits for a response from the RDP through the `cin` channel.\n\n2. **RDP Processing**:\n   - The RDP receives the message from the client through the `cout` channel.\n   - The RDP forwards the client's name and nonce to the organization using the `orgin` channel to retrieve the policy details.\n   - The RDP receives a response from the organization through the `orgout` channel.\n   - If the response matches the request, the RDP forwards the message to the affiliate using the `affin` channel.\n\n3. **Organization Policy**:\n   - The organization receives the request from the RDP through the `orgin` channel.\n   - If the name matches a valid policy, the organization emits the `orgOK` event and sends the policy details back to the RDP using the `orgout` channel.\n\n4. **Affiliate Processing**:\n   - The affiliate receives the message from the RDP through the `affin` channel.\n   - If the message matches the expected organization and operation, the affiliate emits the `affReceivesMsg` event and sends an acknowledgment (`m4`) back to the RDP using the `affout` channel.\n   - The affiliate also publishes the received name to the public channel `pub`.\n\n#### Security Goals\n1. The affiliate should never learn a client's name, whether it is valid or invalid.\n2. The organization must have seen the message before it is forwarded to the affiliate.\n3. Whenever the client sends a request, it should receive a response.\n\nBased on this description, you can generate a corresponding pv file that can be run by ProVerif to verify the security properties of the protocol.

It involves three entities: two hosts (A and B) and a server (S). The protocol aims to authenticate host A to host B using a shared key between each host and the server.\n\n#### Steps of the Protocol:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The protocol starts with the server (S) and both hosts (A and B) having pre-established shared keys with the server (Kas for A and Kbs for B).\n\n2. **Initiator (A) Actions:**\n   - Host A, acting as the initiator, sends its identity (xA) to host B.\n   - Host A receives a nonce (N) from host B.\n   - Host A encrypts a message containing its identity, host B's identity, and the nonce with its shared key (kas) and sends this encrypted message to host B.\n\n3. **Responder (B) Actions:**\n   - Host B, acting as the responder, receives the identity of the initiator (xA) and generates a fresh nonce (N).\n   - Host B sends the nonce to host A.\n   - Host B receives an encrypted message from host A and decrypts it using its shared key (kbs).\n   - Host B then sends the encrypted message, along with the nonce and its identity, to the server (S).\n\n4. **Server (S) Actions:**\n   - The server receives the message from host B.\n   - The server decrypts the message using host B's shared key (kbs) to obtain host A's identity, host B's identity, and the encrypted message.\n   - The server then decrypts the inner message using host A's shared key (kas) to obtain the original message.\n   - The server encrypts this message with host B's shared key (kbs) and sends it back to host B.\n\n5. **Verification:**\n   - Host B receives the final message from the server and decrypts it using its shared key (kbs).\n   - Host B verifies that the decrypted message matches the expected message.\n\n#### Additional Information:\n\n- The protocol includes a key registration process where new keys can be inserted into the key table.\n- The pv file includes queries to check the integrity of the protocol execution, ensuring that the events are properly initiated and completed.\n- The protocol assumes that the shared keys between the hosts and the server are not known to the attacker.\n\n### ProVerif PV File Content\n\nBased on the above description, the corresponding PV file content includes the following elements:\n\n- **Type Definitions:** Definitions of host, nonce, and key types.\n- **Encryption Function:** A function `encrypt` that represents the encryption mechanism.\n- **Secrecy Assumptions:** Assumptions that the shared keys Kas and Kbs are not known to the attacker.\n- **Roles:** Definitions of the roles of the initiator, responder, and server, including the messages they send and receive.\n- **Key Registration:** A process for inserting new keys into the key table.\n- **Main Process:** The main process that initializes the keys and starts the protocol processes.\n\nThe pv file also includes queries to verify the protocol's correctness and a process to simulate an unbounded number of protocol sessions. The protocol is expected to be secure under the assumptions made, but the actual security analysis would be performed by ProVerif."]]}}
