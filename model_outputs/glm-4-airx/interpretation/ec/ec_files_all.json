It uses the `pr_interval_to_sum_lemma'` to prove its correctness by considering the range from `s` to `e`.\n\nThe protocol appears to be focused on probability calculations and does not specify the actual behavior of the `run` procedure within module `A`. The lemmas are likely used to prove properties about the distribution of the outputs produced by `A.run`.\n\nTo generate the corresponding ec file from this description, one would need to define the types `rt` and `iat`, the behavior of the `run` procedure within module `A`, and any additional necessary properties or assumptions about the protocol's execution.\n\n---\n\nFrom this description, we can see that the protocol is abstract and lacks concrete details about the implementation of `A.run`. To fully implement the ec file, one would need to specify how the `run` procedure operates and what the global state `(glob A)` consists of.

It defines one procedure:\n   - `play()`: The procedure that interacts with the game's `guess` method.\n\n3. `Main (O:GuessGame) (A:Adversary)`: The main protocol module that coordinates the interaction between the `GuessGame` module `O` and the `Adversary` module `A`. It defines one procedure:\n   - `main(q: int)`: Executes the game with an integer `q` and interacts with the adversary to play the game.\n\n4. `GG`: An instance of the `GuessGame` module that keeps track of the game's state with variables `win`, `c`, and `q`. It defines:\n   - `init(q: int)`: Initializes the game state.\n   - `guess(x: bits): bool`: The guessing logic which samples a value from the distribution `bD` and updates the `win` state.\n\n** Lemmas:**\n- `winPr &m`: A lemma that upper bounds the probability of the `GG.win` variable being `true` after the execution of the `main` procedure. The bound is expressed in terms of the integer `q` and the support size of the distribution `bD`.\n\n**Proof:**\n- The protocol includes a proof for the `winPr` lemma that involves a series of steps, including the use of the `mu1_uni_ll` property to relate the uniform distribution and the losslessness of `bD`.

Here is a description of the protocol:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Theory and Types\n\n- The protocol starts by importing necessary libraries and defining the abstract theory `SKE`.\n- It defines three types: `key` for encryption keys, `plaintext` for messages to be encrypted, and `ciphertext` for encrypted messages.\n\n#### Module Type\n\n- `module type SKE` defines the interface for a symmetric key encryption scheme, which includes an initialization procedure (`init`), a key generation procedure (`kg`), an encryption procedure (`enc`), and a decryption procedure (`dec`).\n\n#### Correctness Module\n\n- `module Correctness` is a specification module that demonstrates the correctness of the encryption scheme by ensuring that the decryption of an encrypted message with the correct key yields the original plaintext.\n\n#### Oracles and Adversaries\n\n- In the `SKE_RND` theory, oracles are introduced as part of the simulation for CCA and CPA games. Oracles are modules that provide the adversary with the ability to perform encryption and decryption operations.\n- `CCA_Oracles` and `CPA_Oracles` are types of oracles with different sets of available procedures, reflecting the different powers of adversaries in CCA and CPA attacks.\n- `CCA_Adv` and `CPA_Adv` are types of adversaries that can interact with these oracles.\n\n#### Games\n\n- `CCA_game` and `CPA_game` are modules that simulate the CCA and CPA games, respectively. These games measure the advantage an adversary has against the encryption scheme.\n\n#### Real World and Memory Modules\n\n- `Mem` is a memory module that simulates the real-world use of the encryption scheme, including a key (`k`), a log of ciphertext-plaintext pairs (`log`), and a list of ciphertexts (`lc`).\n\n#### Oracle Implementations\n\n- `RealOrcls` is a module that implements the CCA_Oracles interface using the actual encryption scheme (`S`).\n- `CPA_CCA_Orcls` is a module that implements the CCA_Oracles interface for use in CPA games, logging answers to encryption queries.\n\n#### Adversary Implementations\n\n- `CCA_CPA_Adv` is a module that adapts a CCA adversary to work within the constraints of a CPA game.\n\n#### Security Proof\n\n- `CCA_CPA_UFCMA` is an abstract theory that assumes the existence of a deterministic and stateless decryption algorithm and provides a proof of security for the encryption scheme under CCA and CPA attacks.\n- The security proof is done by showing the equivalence of the CCA game and a modified CPA game (UFCMA) and bounding the probability of the CCA adversary's success by the probability of success in the CPA game plus the probability of certain events in the UFCMA game.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe `ec` file provided describes a symmetric key encryption protocol with a focus on proving its resistance to CCA and CPA attacks. It includes the definition of the encryption scheme, oracles for simulating attacks, and a security proof demonstrating the scheme's correctness and resistance to these types of attacks.

It contains procedures to:\n  - `tag`: Generate a pair of plaintext and PRF output for a given index.\n  - `reader_i`: Check if a given pair of plaintext and PRF output is valid for a specific index.\n  - `reader`: Check if a given pair is valid for any index within a defined range (`n_tag`).\n\n- The `BasicHash` module extends `BasicHash0` with an initialization procedure that prepares the PRFs and resets logs.\n\n#### Adversary and Authentication Game\n- The protocol defines an adversary `Adv` that can interact with the `BasicHash` module and attempt to forge valid PRF outputs.\n- An authentication game `AuthGame` is set up to determine if the adversary can successfully forge a PRF output, which would indicate a weakness in the protocol.\n\n#### Distinguisher and Indistinguishability Game\n- A distinguisher `Distinguisher` is used to test whether the PRFs are indistinguishable from random functions.\n- An indistinguishability game `EUF_PRF_IND` is played between the PRFs and the distinguisher to check if the PRFs can be distinguished from random functions.\n\n#### Lemmas and Proofs\n- The file contains several lemmas (`dnonce_ll`, `dnonce_uni`, `drf_ll`, `drf_uni`, `eq_RF`, `eq_PRF`, and `res_0`) that establish properties about the distributions and the behavior of the protocol.\n- The `auth0` lemma concludes by relating the probability of the adversary successfully forging a PRF output to the indistinguishability of the PRFs from random functions.\n\n### Summary\nThe EasyCrypt file defines a protocol for authentication using PRFs and includes an adversary model to test the protocol's security. It also provides a framework to prove the security of the protocol by showing that the PRFs are indistinguishable from random functions and that the adversary cannot win the authentication game with a probability greater than zero."]]}, "EC-1/ddh-1.ec": {"code": [[true, "(* DDH.h *)\n(* This file defines the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption and associated adversary models. *)\n\n(* Decisional Diffie-Hellman Assumption *)\n\nprover [\"\"].

Below is a description of the protocol that would allow someone to reconstruct the corresponding `ec` file:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Imports and Assumptions\n- The protocol starts by importing necessary libraries and theories, including `AllCore`, `Int`, `Real`, `Distr`, `DBool` for basic cryptographic primitives and types.\n- It also imports the `DiffieHellman` and `PKE_CPA` theories, which are presumably defined elsewhere, to use their concepts and properties.\n\n#### Pragmas and Definitions\n- The `pragma +implicits` is used to enable implicit arguments for function calls, which simplifies the syntax.\n- A clone of the `DiffieHellman` theory is created under the name `DH`, and the `DDH` and `FDistr` modules are imported to work with the DDH assumption and a specific distribution, respectively.\n\n#### Public Key Encryption (PKE) Construction\n- The protocol defines types for public keys (`pkey`), secret keys (`skey`), plaintexts (`ptxt`), and ciphertexts (`ctxt`) as abstract types.\n- A clone of the `PKE_CPA` module is created with the previously defined types to construct a CPA-secure Public Key Encryption scheme.\n\n#### ElGamal Construction\n- The `ElGamal` module defines the ElGamal encryption scheme with the following procedures:\n  - `kg`: Generates a public and private key pair (`pkey * skey`) by randomly selecting a secret key (`sk`) and computing the corresponding public key.\n  - `enc`: Encrypts a plaintext (`ptxt`) into a ciphertext (`ctxt`) using a public key (`pkey`) and a randomly chosen exponent (`y`).\n  - `dec`: Decrypts a ciphertext (`ctxt`) into a plaintext (`ptxt`) using a secret key (`skey`), or returns `None` if decryption fails.\n\n#### DDH Adversary Construction\n- The `DDHAdv` module constructs a DDH adversary from a given PKE adversary `A`. It defines a procedure `guess` that simulates the behavior of the PKE adversary in a DDH experiment.\n\n#### Security Proof\n- The `Security` section contains the main security proof, which shows that the difference in probability of the PKE adversary's success in breaking ElGamal encryption and the success of a DDH adversary is negligible.\n- The proof uses several lemmas (`cpa_ddh0`, `ddh1_gb`, and `Gb_half`) to establish the equivalence between the CPA experiment and the DDH experiment, ultimately proving the security of the ElGamal scheme under the DDH assumption.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- The `print conclusion` statement outputs the final theorem, which states that the absolute difference between the probability of the CPA experiment's result and 1/2 is equal to the absolute difference between the probabilities of the two DDH experiments' results.\n\nBased on this description, one could generate an `ec` file by reconstructing the sections and procedures outlined above, ensuring that all the necessary imports, clones, definitions, and theorems are included as per the original file's structure. The description omits some of the intricacies of the EasyCrypt language for brevity and clarity, but it captures the essence of the protocol and its security proof."]]}, "EC-1/hashed_elgamal_std.ec": {"code": [[true, "(* -------------------------------------------------------------------- *)\nrequire import AllCore Int Real Distr DBool.\nrequire (*--*) DiffieHellman BitWord PKE_CPA.\n\n(* Sane Default Behaviours: Set the implicit type system to be more lenient. *)\npragma +implicits.\n\n(* Let's Get Started: Define the size of the key used in the protocol. *)\nop k : { int | 0 < k } as gt0_k.\n\nclone import BitWord as Bits with\n  op n <- k\nproof gt0_n by exact/gt0_k\nrename\n  \"word\" as \"bits\"\n  \"dunifin\" as \"dbits\".\nimport DWord.\n\n(** Assumption: DDH - We assume the Decisional Diffie-Hellman problem is hard. *)\nclone import DiffieHellman as DH.\nimport DDH FDistr.\n\n(** Entropy Smoothing Theory: Define the components needed for entropy smoothing. *)\ntheory EntropySmoothing.\n  type hkey.\n\n  op dhkey: { hkey distr | is_lossless dhkey } as dhkey_ll.\n  (* dhkey is a lossless distribution of keys *)\n  hint exact random : dhkey_ll.  \n\n  op hash : hkey -> group -> bits.\n  (* hash function mapping from a key and a group element to a bit string *)\n\n  (* Define an adversary module type for entropy smoothing attacks *)\n  module type AdvES = {\n    proc guess(_: hkey * bits) : bool\n  }.\n\n  (* Two different encryption schemes for the entropy smoothing experiment *)\n  module ES0 (A:AdvES) = {\n    proc main () : bool = {\n      (* Standard entropy smoothing experiment without hashing the group element *)\n      ...\n    }\n  }.\n\n  module ES1 (A:AdvES) = {\n    proc main () : bool = {\n      (* Entropy smoothing experiment with hashing the group element *)\n      ...\n    }\n  }.\nend EntropySmoothing.\nimport EntropySmoothing.\n\n(** Construction: a PKE - Define the types for public and private keys, plaintexts, and ciphertexts. *)\ntype pkey = hkey * group.\ntype skey = hkey * F.t.\ntype ptxt = bits.\ntype ctxt = group * bits.\n\nclone import PKE_CPA as PKE_ with\n  type pkey <- pkey,\n  type skey <- skey,\n  type ptxt <- ptxt,\n  type ctxt <- ctxt.\n\n(** Concrete Construction: Hashed ElGammal - Implement the key generation, encryption, and decryption procedures for the Hashed ElGamal encryption scheme. *)\nmodule Hashed_ElGamal : Scheme = {\n  ...\n}\n\n(** Adversary definitions for DDH and ES experiments *)\nmodule DDHAdv(A:Adversary) = {\n  ...\n}\n\nmodule ESAdv(A:Adversary) = {\n  ...\n}\n\nsection Security.\n  declare module A:Adversary.\n  (* Axioms stating that the choose and guess procedures of the adversary are lossless *)\n  axiom Ac_ll: islossless A.choose.\n  axiom Ag_ll: islossless A.guess.\n\n  ...\nend section Security.\n\nprint conclusion.", "To add notation to an EasyCrypt file without altering the original content, we can introduce comments or definitions that clarify certain parts of the code without affecting its execution.

The protocol also involves the concept of entropy smoothing and examines the scheme's security properties. Below is a step-by-step description:\n\n#### Prerequisites\n- The protocol requires importing several libraries and theories, including basic types and operations (`AllCore`), integers (`Int`), real numbers (`Real`), distributions (`Distr`), boolean distributions (`DBool`), Diffie-Hellman key exchange (`DiffieHellman`), and a definition for CPA (Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure public-key encryption (`PKE_CPA`).\n\n#### Definitions and Assumptions\n- A positive integer `k` is defined, which is used to define the size of bit strings (`bits`).\n- The Diffie-Hellman assumption is imported and treated with a warning about potential outdated developments.\n- An `EntropySmoothing` theory is defined to model the behavior of a hypothetical adversary in an entropy smoothing attack scenario. This includes a type `hkey` for the secret keys, a lossless distribution `dhkey` for generating these keys, a hash function `hash`, and two modules (`ES0` and `ES1`) that model the adversary's guessing behavior.\n\n#### Construction of the PKE Scheme\n- The protocol defines types for public keys (`pkey`), secret keys (`skey`), plaintexts (`ptxt`), and ciphertexts (`ctxt`).\n- A concrete encryption scheme, `Hashed_ElGamal`, is constructed by cloning the `PKE_CPA` module with the defined types. This module includes:\n  - A key generation procedure (`kg`) that selects a random `dhkey` and computes the corresponding public and private keys.\n  - An encryption procedure (`enc`) that encrypts plaintext by generating a random exponent, hashing the public key, and combining this with the plaintext using a bitwise XOR operation.\n  - A decryption procedure (`dec`) that attempts to recover the plaintext from a ciphertext using the secret key.\n\n#### Security Analysis\n- The protocol defines two adversary modules, `DDHAdv` and `ESAdv`, which are used to model the security of the `Hashed_ElGamal` scheme against certain attacks.\n- Several lemmas (`cpa_ddh0`, `ddh1_es1`, and `es0_Gb`) are provided to relate the probability of the `Hashed_ElGamal` scheme correctly encrypting and decrypting messages to the probability of successfully attacking the underlying Diffie-Hellman problem or breaking the entropy smoothing assumption.\n- A `Gb` module is also introduced as part of a proof to show that the probability of an adversary correctly guessing the outcome is 50% under certain conditions.\n\n#### Conclusion\n- The `conclusion` lemma states that the difference between the probability of a successful CPA attack on the `Hashed_ElGamal` scheme and the probability of 1/2 (random guessing) is bounded by the difference in probabilities of successfully attacking the Diffie-Hellman problem and breaking the entropy smoothing assumption.\n\nThis description summarizes the content and purpose of the provided ec file, which can be used to generate an EasyCrypt file that would allow running the protocol and proving its properties within the EasyCrypt proof assistant."]]}, "EC-1/KEMDEM.ec": {"code": [[false, "To add the necessary notation for the EasyCrypt code to remain semantically correct and beRunnable by EasyCrypt, we need to include the proper syntax for function types, procedure calls, and other constructs that EasyCrypt recognizes.

Below is a description of the protocol based on the content of the ec file:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**1. Protocol Components:**\n\n- **Types:**\n  - `nonce`: A type representing a nonce (a random value used only once).\n  - `plaintext`: A type representing the data to be encrypted.\n  - `key`: A type representing the encryption key.\n\n- **Distributions:**\n  - `dkey`: A distribution over keys.\n  - `dplaintext`: A distribution over plaintexts.\n\n- **Operations:**\n  - `f`: A function that models the PRF, mapping keys and nonces to plaintexts.\n  - `enc`: A function for encryption, which takes a key, nonce, and plaintext, and returns a ciphertext by applying the PRF to the key and nonce and then XORing the result with the plaintext.\n  - `dec`: A function for decryption, which takes a key, nonce, and ciphertext, and returns the plaintext by applying the PRF to the key and nonce and then XORing the result with the ciphertext.\n\n**2. Assumptions:**\n\n- The distributions `dkey` and `dplaintext` are assumed to be lossless and uniform, and `dplaintext` is also assumed to be full (i.e., it covers the entire plaintext space).\n\n**3. Protocol Structure:**\n\n- **Key Generation (`kg`):** A probabilistic algorithm that generates a key from the `dkey` distribution.\n- **Encryption (`enc`):** A probabilistic algorithm that takes a key, nonce, and plaintext, and outputs a ciphertext using the `enc` function.\n- **Decryption (`dec`):** A probabilistic algorithm that takes a key, nonce, and ciphertext, and outputs the original plaintext using the `dec` function.\n\n**4. Correctness Lemmas:**\n\n- `correct_enc_h`, `correct_enc_ll`, `correct_enc`: These lemmas prove that the encryption process is correct and always terminates, and that the output of the encryption algorithm matches the `enc` function.\n- `correct_dec_h`, `correct_dec_ll`, `correct_dec`: These lemmas prove that the decryption process is correct and always terminates, and that the output of the decryption algorithm matches the `dec` function.\n\n**5. Security Proof:**\n\n- The protocol's security is proven by showing that an adversary's advantage in breaking the encryption scheme is related to their advantage in breaking the underlying PRF. This involves several steps, including:\n  - `Real_CPA_PRF`: A lemma showing the equivalence between the real CPA game and a PRF-based ideal game.\n  - `Modified_CPA_PRF`: A lemma showing the equivalence between the modified scheme (using a random function) and the PRF-based ideal game.\n  - `Modified_CPA_Ideal`: A lemma showing the equivalence between the modified scheme and the ideal scheme.\n  - `incpa_security_hop`: A theorem relating the advantages of the adversary in the real game and the ideal game, and showing that the number of queries made by the adversary in both games is the same.\n\n**6. Alternative Proof:**\n\n- An alternative proof is provided using a direct reduction from the ideal scheme to the ideal PRF game, which also shows that the adversary's advantage in breaking the encryption scheme is related to their advantage in breaking the PRF.\n\nThis description captures the main components and properties of the protocol as described in the EasyCrypt file.

The protocol involves an adversary, `A`, which is modeled as an OW-CPA adversary, and a public key encryption scheme, `S`, which is tested against this adversary.\n\nThe protocol includes a game, `OW_CPA_V`, where an encryption scheme is used to encrypt two randomly chosen plaintexts, and the adversary is given the ciphertext of one of these plaintexts.

It provides both hiding (the value cannot be determined from the commitment) and binding (once a commitment is made, it is impossible to change the committed value without detection).\n\n#### Protocol Components:\n- **Types:**\n  - `value`: An element from a group (typically a large prime cyclic group).\n  - `message`: An exponentiation of the committed value.\n  - `commitment`: The result of the commitment process, which is a group element.\n  - `openingkey`: A key used to open the commitment and verify the committed value.\n\n- **Commitment Scheme Interface:**\n  - `gen()`: Generates a random value and computes its commitment.\n  - `commit(h: value, m: message)`: Generates a commitment and an opening key for a given message.\n  - `verify(h: value, m: message, c: commitment, d: openingkey)`: Verifies the commitment for a given message.\n\n#### Protocol Steps:\n1. **Generation (`gen`):**\n   - A random value `x` is chosen from the group.\n   - The commitment `h` is computed as `h = g^x`, where `g` is a generator of the group.\n\n2. **Commitment (`commit`):**\n   - A random opening key `d` is chosen.\n   - The commitment `c` is computed as `c = (g^d) * (h^m)`.\n\n3. **Verification (`verify`):**\n   - Given the commitment `c`, the original value `h`, the message `m`, and the opening key `d`, the verification checks if `c` equals `(g^d) * (h^m)`.\n\n#### Security Properties:\n- **Correctness:** The `verify` procedure should always return `true` when given the correct commitment and opening key.\n- **Perfect Hiding:** The commitment should be indistinguishable from a random element in the group, making it computationally infeasible to determine the committed value.\n- **Computational Binding:** Once a commitment is made, it should be computationally infeasible to find another message that would produce the same commitment, assuming the discrete logarithm problem is hard.\n\n#### Security Proofs:\n- **Correctness Proof (`pedersen_correctness`):** This proof shows that the `verify` function always returns the correct result.\n- **Perfect Hiding Proof (`pedersen_perfect_hiding`):** This proof demonstrates that the commitment is as indistinguishable as a random group element.\n- **Computational Binding Proof (`pedersen_computational_binding`):** This proof establishes that the commitment scheme is computationally binding, meaning that an adversary cannot find a new message that matches the commitment without knowledge of the original message.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThe Pedersen Commitment Scheme provides a secure way to commit to a value while maintaining the properties of hiding and binding, making it suitable for various cryptographic applications, such as secure multi-party computation and digital signatures.\n\n---\n\nThis description content should be sufficient to generate the corresponding ec file for the Pedersen Commitment Scheme using the EasyCrypt tool.

It has an `init` procedure to initialize the module and a function `f` that takes a seed and returns a tuple of a new seed and an output.\n\n4. **Pseudorandom Generator (PRG)**: A module type that has an `init` procedure to initialize the PRG and a `prg` procedure that produces random outputs. The PRG maintains an internal state that includes a seed and a log of seeds used.\n\n5. **Distinguisher (Adv)**: A module type that can query a PRF and a PRG a limited number of times (specified by `qF` for the PRF and `qP` for the PRG) and returns a boolean value.\n\n6. **Concrete Considerations**: The protocol uses a specific random function (RF) and PRG. The RF maintains a map (`m`) that associates seeds with pairs of new seeds and outputs. The PRG uses the RF to generate outputs and maintains a log of seeds used.\n\n7. **Oracle Games**: The protocol involves several oracle games to prove the security of the PRG. These games include logging the queries made to the PRF and PRG, and using this information to bound the probability of certain events.\n\n8. **Security Proof**: The protocol's security is proven by showing that an adversary cannot distinguish between the PRG and a sampling operation that directly samples from the output distribution (`dout`).\n\n### Protocol Steps\n\n1. **Initialization**: The RF and PRG are initialized.\n\n2. **Adversary Query**: The adversary makes queries to the PRF and PRG up to `qF` and `qP` times, respectively.\n\n3. **Logging**: The protocol logs the seeds used by the PRG in a list (`logP`).\n\n4. **Security Game**: The protocol constructs a security game where the adversary's goal is to distinguish between the PRG and a sampling operation. The game involves bounding the probability of certain events that indicate a weakness in the PRG.\n\n5. **Proof of Security**: The protocol proves that the PRG is secure by showing that the probability of the adversary successfully distinguishing the PRG from the sampling operation is bounded by a small value.\n\n### Security Properties\n\nThe protocol aims to demonstrate the following security properties:\n\n- The PRG is indistinguishable from sampling in the output distribution (`dout`) by an adversary with access to the PRF and PRG interfaces.\n- The security of the PRG is proven using a series of oracle games and bounding techniques.\n\nThis description provides a high-level overview of the protocol and its components.
