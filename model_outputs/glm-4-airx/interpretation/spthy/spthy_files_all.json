It is an extension of the KEA protocol and is designed to provide secure key establishment between two parties, an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R). The protocol leverages the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism and includes additional features for enhanced security.\n\n**Modeler**: Jannik Dreier, Ralf Sasse  \n**Date**: April 2015  \n**Source**: Lauter, Mityagin, 2006  \n**Property**: Key indistinguishable from randomness  \n**Status**: Unknown\n\n**Functions**:\n- `h/1`: Hash function with one input parameter.\n- `g/0`: Generator function that produces a group element.\n\n**Protocol Rules**:\n\n1. **Generate Long-term Key Pair**:\n   Each party generates a long-term public/private key pair. Party A computes `pkA` as `g` raised to the power of its private long-term key `~lkA`. The key pair is registered internally, and the public key is outputted.\n\n2. **Initiator (I) Actions**:\n   - **Init_1**: The Initiator computes a temporary public key `hkI` by raising `g` to the power of its ephemeral private key `~eskI`. It sends `hkI` along with other information to the Responder.\n   - **Init_2**: Upon receiving the Responder's public key `pkR` and a response message `Y`, the Initiator computes the session key `kI` using a hash function that incorporates the received and previously generated values.\n\n3. **Responder (R) Actions**:\n   - **Resp_1**: The Responder computes a temporary public key `hkR` and a session key `kR` after receiving the Initiator's message. It then sends `hkR` back to the Initiator.\n\n**Restrictions**:\n- One key per name: Each party can register only one long-term key.\n\n**Lemmas**:\n- Executability: There exists a trace in which both `KeyInit` and `KeyResp` events occur, indicating that the key exchange can be successfully executed.\n\n**Key Reveals** (for the eCK model):\n- The protocol description includes commented-out rules for revealing session keys, long-term keys, and ephemeral keys, which are typically used in the eCK security model for proving security properties.\n\n---\n\nBased on this description, one could generate a corresponding spthy file, but the description itself does not contain all the details needed to reconstruct the entire file, such as the specific syntax and all the rules (especially those commented out or not explicitly mentioned).

The protocol in the spthy file consists of the following elements:\n\n1. **Functions:**\n   - `pk/1`: Represents a public key.\n   - `sk/1`: Represents a private key.\n   - `aenc/2`: Asymmetric encryption function.\n   - `adec/2`: Asymmetric decryption function.\n\n2. **Built-ins:**\n   - `diffie-hellman`: Represents the Diffie-Hellman function.\n   - `symmetric-encryption`: Represents symmetric encryption.\n\n3. **Equations:**\n   - These equations define the relationship between encryption and decryption operations, ensuring that if a message is encrypted with a public key, it can only be decrypted with the corresponding private key, and vice versa.\n\n4. **Rules:**\n   - `Asymmetric_key_setup`: Generates an asymmetric key pair (public and private keys) for a fresh entity.\n   - `Publish_public_keys`: Publishes the public key of an entity.\n   - `Symmetric_key_setup`: Establishes a symmetric key for a fresh pair of entities.\n   - `Init_Knowledge`: Initializes the knowledge of the public and private keys for both entities.\n   - `dh_1_A` and `dh_1_B`: The initial step for entities A and B, respectively, where they generate a fresh value and output it.\n   - `dh_2_A` and `dh_2_B`: The intermediate steps where entities A and B, respectively, receive the other entity's output.\n   - `dh_3_A` and `dh_3_B`: The final steps where entities A and B, respectively, output the shared secret key encrypted with the received value.\n\n5. **Lemmas:**\n   - `key_secret`: Ensures that the shared secret key is not known to any other party.\n   - `key_secretA` and `key_secretB`: Ensure that the shared secret key is not known to any other party except entities A and B, respectively.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. Both entities A and B generate their public and private key pairs.\n2. They publish their public keys.\n3. Both entities initialize their states with their respective keys.\n4. Each entity performs the following steps:\n   a. Generate a fresh value.\n   b. Compute the Diffie-Hellman value using the fresh value and the other entity's public key.\n   c. Send the computed value to the other entity.\n   d. Receive the other entity's computed value.\n   e. Decrypt the received value using their private key to obtain the shared secret key.\n   f. Optionally, encrypt the shared secret key with the other entity's public key and send it back to ensure mutual knowledge of the secret key.\n\nThe above description is a high-level overview of the protocol as represented in the spthy file. It is designed to be detailed enough so that someone familiar with the Tamarin tool could use it to reconstruct the spthy file or to understand the protocol's flow.

The initiator (I) sends a message to the responder (R) which includes:\n   - A protocol identifier '1'.\n   - A nonce value `ni` generated by the initiator.\n   - The identity of the initiator (I).\n   \n   This message is encrypted with the responder's public key.\n\n2. The responder (R) responds with a message to the initiator (I) which includes:\n   - A protocol identifier '2'.\n   - The nonce `ni` received from the initiator.\n   - A fresh nonce `nr` generated by the responder.\n   \n   This message is encrypted with the initiator's public key.\n\n3. The initiator (I) sends a final message to the responder (R) which includes:\n   - The protocol identifier '3'.\n   - The nonce `nr` received from the responder.\n   \n   This message is encrypted with the responder's public key.\n\n**Protocol Rules:**\n\n- `Register_pk`: Models the registration of a public key for an entity.\n- `Reveal_ltk`: Models the action of revealing a long-term private key.\n- `I_1`: The rule that initiates the protocol by sending the first message from the initiator to the responder.\n- `R_1`: The rule that processes the first message from the initiator and sends a response back.\n- `I_2`: The rule that processes the responder's message and sends the final message.\n- `R_2`: The rule that processes the final message from the initiator and establishes the shared secrets.\n- `Secrecy_claim`: A rule that represents the secrecy of shared information.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n\nThe protocol is analyzed with respect to the following security properties:\n- Nonce secrecy: Ensures that nonces (unique random numbers used to prevent replay attacks) are not revealed to an adversary without a long-term key being revealed.\n- Injective agreement: Ensures that if two parties agree on a shared secret, no other parties can claim to have agreed on the same secret without revealing their long-term keys.\n- Session key setup possibility: Ensures that it is possible for honest parties to establish a shared secret without revealing their long-term keys.\n\n**Additional Notes:**\n\n- The protocol model is untyped, meaning that additional type invariants would be required for formal proof construction.\n- The protocol is known to have security vulnerabilities and is subject to attacks, such as the man-in-the-middle attack.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a high-level overview of the protocol based on the provided spthy file.

The protocol is stateful, meaning that the knowledge of both the reader and the tag is updated after a successful execution. The protocol does not ensure untraceability or the recent aliveness of the reader but does ensure the recent aliveness of the tag.\n\n**Initial Setup:**\n- The reader and the tag share a secret key `k`.\n- The reader generates a fresh random number `r` and sends it to the tag.\n- The tag computes the hash of the XOR of `k` and `r` and sends it back to the reader.\n- The reader then generates a fresh key `k1` and sends the XOR of `k` and `k1` to the tag.\n- The reader updates its knowledge of `k` to `k1`, and the tag does the same.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Setup Rule:**\n   - The system initializes with fresh variables for the keys and random numbers.\n   - The reader outputs a message containing `r`, the hash of `k XOR r`, and the new key `k1`.\n   - The tag is initialized with an initial key and the current key.\n\n2. **Tag Interaction Rules:**\n   - **tag1 Rule:** When the reader receives a message from the tag, it sends a challenge to the tag. The tag computes the hash of the XOR of its current key and the received random number and sends it back to the reader. This step ensures the tag's recent aliveness.\n   - **tag2 Rule:** The reader can update the tag's key by sending a new key. The tag computes the new key by XORing the received new key with its current key and updates its key accordingly.\n\n**Properties and Restrictions:**\n- The protocol uses cryptographic hashing and XOR operations to secure the communication.\n- The protocol has restrictions to ensure that certain actions occur only once and that the tag's state is properly initialized.\n- A lemma (`tag_start`) is provided to prove that the tag's state must have been set up at some point before it starts communicating.\n- An observational equivalence attack has been found, indicating that the protocol may not be secure against all types of attacks.\n\n**Security Goals:**\n- The protocol aims to ensure the recent aliveness of the tag but does not guarantee untraceability or the recent aliveness of the reader.\n\n---\n\nThis description should provide enough information to create a corresponding spthy file that can be processed by the Tamarin prover.

The protocol is designed to provide secure communication channels resistant to certain types of attacks, such as small subgroup attacks.\n\n**Participants:**\n- Initiator (I)\n- Responder (R)\n\n**Public Infrastructure:**\n- Register_pk: Registers a public key for a user by mapping a long-term private key to a corresponding public key and publishing it.\n\n**Initiator Actions:**\n- Init_1: The Initiator generates a temporary private key, computes the corresponding public key, and sends a message including this public key raised to the power of the temporary private key.\n- Init_2: Upon receiving a response, the Initiator verifies the response and computes the session key using the received data and the Initiator's long-term private key.\n\n**Responder Actions:**\n- Resp_1: The Responder generates a temporary private key, verifies the Initiator's message, and computes the session key using its long-term private key.\n\n**Reveal Actions:**\n- Sessionkey_Reveal: Allows the revelation of a session key.\n- Ltk_Reveal: Allows the revelation of a long-term private key.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n- Executable: Ensures that the protocol execution is consistent, meaning that both the Initiator and Responder can agree on the same session key without external interference.\n- Secrecy_wrt_sesskRev_and_ltk_rev_Initiator: Asserts the Initiator's session key secrecy, ensuring that the key is not revealed unless explicitly done so by the Initiator, and that no other party can compute the session key without proper authorization.\n- Secrecy_wrt_sesskRev_and_ltk_rev_Responder: Similar to the Initiator's secrecy, this property ensures the Responder's session key secrecy under the same conditions.\n\n**Security Analysis:**\nThe protocol's security analysis revolves around the resistance to key revelation and the integrity of the session key establishment process. The lemmas provided in the file enforce the non-reusability of session keys and the confidentiality of long-term keys.\n\n---\n\nBased on this description, one should be able to create a corresponding spthy file that models the MTI/C0 protocol in the Tamarin prover.

The private key is kept secret, while the public key is distributed and associated with the party's identity (`id`).\n\n2. **Initialization by Party A:**\n   - Party A creates a message (`m1`) containing its identity (`idA`), the identity of party B (`idB`), and its public key (`pkA`).\n   - Party A sends message `m1` to party B through an adversarially controlled channel.\n\n3. **Initialization by Party B:**\n   - Party B receives message `m1` and uses the received public key (`pkA`) to compute a shared secret.\n   - Party B then creates a response message (`m2`) that includes the shared secret encrypted with a symmetric encryption algorithm and sends it back to party A.\n\n4. **Message Sending by Party A:**\n   - Party A receives the response message (`m2`) from party B and uses the shared secret to decrypt the message.\n   - Party A then sends a message (`m3`) that contains data encrypted with the shared secret to party B.\n\n**Security Properties and Assumptions:**\n\n- The protocol assumes that the keys and identities are unique, preventing an adversary from registering arbitrary keys or identities.\n- The Diffie-Hellman key exchange ensures that only the parties with the correct private keys can compute the shared secret.\n- Symmetric encryption ensures that only the intended recipient with the shared secret can decrypt the messages.\n- The protocol assumes the PKI (Public Key Infrastructure) is correct and has unique registrations.\n\n** Lemmas for Verification:**\n\nThe protocol includes several lemmas that are intended to be proven to verify its security properties:\n\n- `Executability`: Ensures that the protocol can be executed correctly by both parties.\n- `ExecutabilityEqS`: Ensures that the shared secrets computed by both parties are equal.\n- `ResponderKeySecrecy` and `InitiatorKeySecrecy`: Ensure that the shared secrets are kept secret from the adversary.\n- `AgreementOnKey`: Ensures that if one party computes a shared secret, the other party will compute the same shared secret.\n- `PKICorrectness` and `PKIValidation`: Ensure the correctness and uniqueness of public key registrations in the PKI.\n\nThe protocol also includes some lemmas that are expected to be falsified (`AgreementOnKey2_SHOULD_BE_FALSIFIED`), indicating potential security vulnerabilities if they are proven true.\n\n**Heuristics and Restrictions:**\n\n- A heuristic is set to `c` to improve the efficiency of the Tamarin prover.\n- The `Eq` action fact is commented out but can be used to compare terms in the protocol.\n\nThis description provides a high-level overview of the protocol and the security properties it aims to achieve, based on the given spthy file.

Below is a description of the protocol:\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Description: RYY Identity-Based Key Exchange Protocol**\n\nThe RYY protocol is a model of an identity-based key exchange mechanism. It involves a Key Generation Center (KGC), two parties (A and B), and uses bilinear pairings for cryptographic operations. The protocol is designed to establish a secure session key between the two parties based on their identities.\n\n**Key Generation Center (KGC) Operations:**\n\n1. **KGC_Setup:** The KGC generates a master secret key (`msk`) which is kept private.\n   \n2. **KGC_Request:** Upon request, the KGC generates a long-term key for a party identified by `$ID`. The long-term key is derived by multiplying the master secret key with the hash of the party's identity (`hp($ID)`).\n\n**Reveals:**\n\n1. **Reveal_ltk:** This rule models the scenario where the long-term key of a party is revealed to the adversary.\n\n2. **Reveal_master_key:** Models the revealing of the KGC's master secret key to the adversary.\n\n3. **Reveal_session_key:** Models the revealing of a session key established between two parties to the adversary.\n\n**Protocol Execution:**\n\n1. **Init_1:** Party A initiates the protocol by generating an ephemeral key (`~ex`) and sending a message including `g^~ex` to party B.\n\n2. **Init_2:** Party B receives the message from A, computes a session key using its long-term key (`skB`), and the ephemeral key sent by A. If successful, B stores the session key.\n\n3. **Resp_1:** Party B generates its own ephemeral key (`~ey`), computes a session key, and sends a message to party A. If successful, B stores the session key.\n\n**Security Lemmas:**\n\n1. **key_agreement_reachable:** This lemma states that it is possible to reach a state where two parties have agreed on a session key without either party being the originator or responder in both cases.\n\n2. **key_secrecy_PFS:** This lemma specifies that if an adversary learns a session key, then there must have been a breach of security, such as the revelation of long-term or master keys before the session key was established.\n\n---\n\nBased on this description, one could generate a corresponding spthy file, but since the description is abstract and does not contain the specific syntax and structure required by the Tamarin prover, it is not directly executable. The description serves as a high-level overview of the protocol's operations and security properties.

Below is the description content of the protocol:\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Description: KCL07**\n\n**Purpose:** The KCL07 protocol is designed to establish the recent aliveness of an RFID tag by interacting with a reader through a series of steps involving cryptographic operations.\n\n**Entities:**\n- **Reader (R):** The entity that initializes communication with the tag and verifies the tag's recent aliveness.\n- **RFID Tag (T):** The entity that responds to the reader's challenge to prove its recent aliveness.\n\n**Shared Knowledge:**\n- **k (Key):** A shared secret key known by both the reader and the tag.\n- **ID:** A unique identifier for the RFID tag known by both the reader and the tag.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Setup:**\n   - The initial setup ensures that both the reader and the tag are fresh entities with knowledge of the shared key `k` and the tag's unique `ID`.\n\n2. **Reader Challenge:**\n   - The reader generates a fresh random value `r1` and sends it to the tag.\n\n3. **Tag Response:**\n   - Upon receiving `r1`, the tag generates a fresh random value `r2`.\n   - The tag computes the XOR of `ID` and `r2`, and also computes the XOR of the hash of the concatenation of `r1` and `k` with `r2`.\n   - The tag sends the result of these two XOR operations back to the reader.\n\n4. **Reader Verification:**\n   - The reader receives the response from the tag, which includes the XORed `ID` and `r2`, and the XORed hash of `r1` and `k` with `r2`.\n   - The reader verifies the tag's recent aliveness by checking if the XOR of the received `ID` and `r2` with the hash of `r1` and `k` XOR `r2` equals the `ID` XOR the hash of `r1` and `k`.\n\n**Properties:**\n\n- **Recent Aliveness:** The reader can confirm the tag's recent aliveness by successfully verifying the response from the tag.\n- **Freshness:** The use of fresh random values (`r1` and `r2`) ensures that each interaction is unique and not replayable.\n\n**Restrictions:**\n\n- The protocol uses cryptographic hashing and XOR operations to maintain the security properties.\n- The `equality` restriction ensures that the equality relation is consistent with actual equality of values.\n- The `unique` restriction ensures that the `OnlyOnce` property is maintained, preventing multiple initializations or responses.\n\n**Proofs:**\n\n- The `recentalive_tag` lemma is a proof that if the tag is considered recently alive at any point in the protocol execution, there must exist a preceding challenge by the reader and a response by the tag.\n- The `executable` lemma shows that there is a valid execution trace where the tag is both recently alive and has responded, indicating the protocol can execute correctly.\n\n---\n\nThis description can be used to generate the corresponding spthy file, which will include the theory, rules, restrictions, and lemmas necessary for Tamarin to analyze the protocol's security properties."]]}, "SPTHY-1/SAKE.spthy": {"code": [[false, "To add semantic notations to this spthy file without changing the original code, we can include comments within the existing code structure.

It is designed to simulate the interactions between an RFID device, Alice, and Bob. The protocol focuses on the generation of keys, usage of the device by Alice, and the transfer of encrypted messages. The following is a description of the components of this protocol:\n\n- **Built-ins**: The protocol uses asymmetric encryption as a built-in functionality.\n\n- **GenKey Rule**: This rule represents the generation of a unique key for the RFID device. The key (`~sk`) is generated fresh and associated with the device. The public key (`pk(~sk)`) is outputted, making it available to potential adversaries.\n\n- **Alice Rule**: Alice uses the RFID device by creating an encrypted message (`aenc{~x,~y}pk(sk)`) using her key (`sk`). The message contains two fresh values (`~x` and `~y`), which are encrypted with the public key of the RFID device.\n\n- **DeviceToBob Rule**: This rule models the action of selecting the RFID device to be handed over to Bob. The `Device_Init` and `Device_Alice` facts are replaced by `Device_Select`.\n\n- **Select_Left and Select_Right Rules**: These rules represent the decision to hand the device to either the left or the right, which are modeled as `Device_Left` and `Device_Right` respectively.\n\n- **Decrypt_Left and Decrypt_Right Rules**: These rules handle the decryption of the message by the entity holding the device on the left or the right. The output is the decrypted value `x` or `y`.\n\n- ** Lemmas:**\n    - **types**: This lemma specifies the conditions under which an `Access` event can occur, requiring either the knowledge of the key (`KU(m)`) before the access, or an `Exclusive` relationship with another message.\n    - **Device_ToBob**: This lemma states that if the device is used by Alice (`Device_Use(sk)`), then any `ToBob(sk)` event must occur after the use event.\n    - **Device_Init_Use_Set**: Similar to `Device_ToBob`, this lemma asserts that if the device is used, then it must have been initialized with a key before use, and the `ToBob(sk)` event must occur after the use and initialization.\n\n- **Attackable Lemmas:**\n    - **reachability_left**: This lemma models an attack scenario where two messages `x` and `y` are exclusively related at some point `i`, and the key for `x` is known at some later point `j`.\n\nAdditional comments in the file suggest that there were attempts to model further properties such as `reachability_right`, `secrecy`, and `Alice_before_to_bob`, but these were either not proven or could not be stated within the constraints of the system.\n\n---\n\nThis description should provide a clear understanding of the RFID_Simple protocol and its components.

(`diffie-hellman`) and digital signing (`signing`).\n\n- The protocol includes functions for Message Authentication Codes (MACs), denoted as `mac/2`.\n\n- The registration process (`RegisterPK` rule) involves a long-term key (`ltk`) and its corresponding public key (`pk`), which are shared with the network.\n\n- The `RevealLTK` rule allows the revelation of a long-term key if necessary.\n\n- The

client's request, generating a random value `~y`, and sending its response back to the client.\n\n- The client and server exchange messages to establish a session key (`k`) based on their respective random values (`~x` and `~y`).\n\n- The client and server have corresponding wait states (`ClientWait` and `ServerWait`) and final states (`ClientDone` and `ServerDone`) that indicate the completion of the key establishment process.\n\n- There are several restrictions in place to ensure the correctness of the protocol, such as the `Equality` and `Inequality` restrictions.\n\n- The protocol includes several lemmas to prove its security properties, such as `HonestTrace`, `KeySecrecy`, `ServerLiveness`, `ClientLiveness`, and `InjectiveAgreement`.\n\n- These lemmas ensure that the

The protocol involves two roles, A and B, who wish to establish a shared secret key.\n\n**Functions and Builtins:**\n- `pk/1`: Returns the public key associated with an entity.\n- `sk/1`: Returns the private key associated with an entity.\n- `aenc/2`: Asymmetric encryption function that encrypts a message with a public key.\n- `adec/2`: Asymmetric decryption function that decrypts a message with a private key.\n- `g/0`: A function representing a generator of a cyclic group used in the Diffie-Hellman process.\n- `diffie-hellman`: A built-in representing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange process.\n\n**Equations:**\n- These equations define how the encryption and decryption functions work with respect to each other. The decryption of an encrypted message with the correct key should result in the original message.\n\n**Rules:**\n1. **Asymmetric_key_setup**: This rule generates a fresh pair of public and private keys for an entity.\n2. **Publish_public_keys**: An entity's public key is sent out to participants.\n3. **Init_Knowledge**: Initializes the state of entities A and B with their respective public and private keys and their shared initial states.\n4. **dh_1_A** and **dh_1_B**: Role A and B send out their first messages, which include a signed message containing 'One', the sender's identity, the receiver's identity, and a random value encrypted with the sender's private key.\n5. **dh_2_A** and **dh_2_B**: Upon receiving the other party's first message, each role computes a shared secret key and sends out a second message that includes the shared secret encrypted with the receiver's private key.\n\n**Lemmas:**\n- **key_secret**: Proves that there does not exist a shared secret key that is known to both A and B and also known to an external party.\n- **key_secretA** and **key_secretB**: Prove that the shared secret key is not known to an external party but is secret to A and B respectively.\n\n**Properties checked:**\n- The protocol ensures that the shared secret key remains secret and is not compromised by external entities.\n\n---\n\nWith this description, one should be able to understand the protocol and potentially generate a corresponding spthy file that could be run by Tamarin. The description covers the main aspects of the protocol and the rules that enforce the security properties.

The protocol involves the exchange of several messages to establish a secure communication channel using cryptographic keys and to verify the identities of both parties.\n\n**Protocol Initialization:**\n- The client generates a nonce `nc` and a session identifier `sid`.\n- The client sends a message to the server containing `nc`, `sid`, and the client's public component `pc`.\n\n**Server's Response:**\n- The server receives the message from the client.\n- The server generates a nonce `ns` and sends a message back to the client with `ns`, the previously received `sid`, and the server's public component `ps`.\n\n**Client's Key Exchange:**\n- The client generates a pre-master secret `pms`.\n- The client computes two keys: `Ckey` (client's key) and `Skey` (server's key) based on `pms`, `nc`, and `ns`.\n- The client sends a message to the server with encrypted `pms`, a signature to authenticate the message, and a message encrypted with `Ckey`.\n\n**Server's Key Exchange:**\n- The server computes the same keys as the client using the received `pms`, `nc`, and `ns`.\n- The server verifies the client's signature and the equality of the session keys.\n- The server sends a message to the client with the session identifier `sid` and the keys encrypted with `Skey`.\n\n**Finalization:**\n- The client receives the server's message, decrypts it with `Ckey`, and verifies the keys.\n- If the keys match, both the client and the server consider the handshake successful and can proceed with secure communication using the established session keys.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n- The protocol ensures that session keys are kept secret and are not known to an adversary unless a long-term key is revealed.\n- The protocol guarantees injective agreement, meaning that once a session is established, no other session with the same parameters can be committed to by either party without revealing their long-term key.\n- It is possible for honest agents to set up session keys without revealing their long-term keys.\n\n**SPthy Modeling Specifics:**\n- The `Register_pk` and `Reveal_ltk` rules are used to model the public key infrastructure and the possible revelation of long-term private keys.\n- The rules `C_1`, `S_1`, `C_2`, `S_2`, and `C_3` correspond to the steps of the handshake process.\n- The `Eq_check_succeed` restriction ensures that equality checks in the protocol are always successful.\n- The `session_key_secrecy`, `injective_agree`, and `session_key_setup_possible` lemmas define the security properties and requirements that the protocol must satisfy.\n\n---\n\nGiven this description, one could proceed to create a spthy file by translating the sequence of steps into the corresponding set of rules and functions, similar to the provided spthy file.

It was modeled by Nick Moore in May 2017 and is currently marked as a working model. The purpose of this protocol is to explore the termination properties of a system using an injectivity constraint-reduction rule.\n\n**Theoretical Framework:**\nThe protocol is defined within a theory block named \"injectivity,\" which includes three main rules that dictate the behavior of the system, along with a lemma that serves as a specification to be proven.\n\n**Rules:**\n\n1. **Init Rule:**\n   - **Condition:** The rule is applicable if there exists an identifier `~i` that is not yet initiated (`Fr(~i)`).\n   - **Action:** Upon the application of this rule, the system transitions from the non-initiated state to an initiated state, marked by `Initiated(~i)`.\n   - **Result:** The system then enters the `Inj(~i)` state, indicating that the identifier `~i` is now in a state where injectivity is relevant.\n\n2. **Copy Rule:**\n   - **Condition:** This rule can be applied if an identifier `i` is in the `Inj(i)` state, implying that it has been initiated and is subject to injectivity constraints.\n   - **Action:** Applying the Copy rule results in a transition that maintains the `Inj(i)` state, marked by `Copied(i)`. This suggests that the identifier can be copied without violating injectivity.\n   - **Result:** The identifier remains in the `Inj(i)` state after copying.\n\n3. **Remove Rule:**\n   - **Condition:** The Remove rule is applicable when an identifier `i` is in the `Inj(i)` state.\n   - **Action:** Applying this rule leads to the removal of the identifier `i` from the system, as indicated by the transition to an empty state (`[]`).\n   - **Result:** The identifier `i` is no longer present in the system after the rule is applied.\n\n**Lemma: injectivity_check**\n- **Purpose:** The lemma `injectivity_check` serves as a specification that must hold true for the protocol to be considered correct.\n- **Statement:** It specifies that it is not possible for any identifier `id` to undergo a sequence of events where it is initiated (`Initiated(id)`), removed (`Removed(id)`), and copied (`Copied(id)`), such that the initiation occurs before the removal and the removal occurs before the copying, i.e., `#i < #j < #k`.\n- **Method:** The lemma employs induction to prove that this condition holds for all possible traces of the protocol's execution.\n\n---\n\nGiven this description, one could proceed to generate the corresponding spthy file for the \"Injectivity test\" protocol, ensuring that the rules and lemma are represented accurately as per the original file. The description provides the necessary detail to understand the structure and purpose of each element within the protocol's formalization."]]}}
