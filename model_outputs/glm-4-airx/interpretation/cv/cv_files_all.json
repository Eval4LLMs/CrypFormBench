This protocol utilizes a group `G` with a generator `gamma` and operations such as exponentiation and multiplication. The security of the protocol relies on the difficulty of distinguishing the DDH problem from a random triplet in the group.\n\n**Parameters and Types:**\n\n- `n`: A parameter representing the security level.\n- `q`: A parameter related to the order of the group `G`.\n- `Z`: A type representing the set of integers modulo `q` (the exponent space).\n- `G`: A type representing the group in which the ElGamal encryption operates.\n\n**Probabilistic Primitives:**\n\n- `pDDH`: A probability representing the advantage of an attacker in solving the DDH problem.\n- `exp(G,Z)`: A function that computes the exponentiation in the group `G`.\n- `mult(Z,Z)`: A binary operation representing multiplication in the exponent space, which is commutative.\n\n**DDH Assumption:**\n\nThe protocol assumes the DDH assumption, which states that it is computationally infeasible to distinguish between a tuple of group elements generated by exponentiating a random generator and a tuple where the third element is the product of the first two elements, both raised to a random exponent.\n\n**ElGamal Encryption Functions:**\n\n- `dot(G,G)`: A function that combines two group elements in a uniform manner, mimicking the encryption operation.\n- `invdot(G,G)`: The left-inverse of `dot`, which is used to simulate the decryption operation.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Key Generation:**\n   - The protocol starts by generating a random exponent `x` and computing the public key `alpha` as `exp(gamma, x)`.\n   - The public key `alpha` is then sent out on the `cPK` channel.\n\n2. **Encryption Process:**\n   - The encryption process receives two messages `m0` and `m1` on the `cE` channel.\n   - It randomly chooses between the two messages based on a boolean `b` and encrypts the chosen message.\n   - The encryption process involves generating a random exponent `y`, computing `beta` as `exp(gamma, y)`, `delta` as `exp(alpha, y)`, and finally computing the ciphertext `zeta` as the result of `dot(delta, m)`.\n\n3. **Ciphertext Output:**\n   - The resulting ciphertext `(beta, zeta)` is sent out on the `cEret` channel.\n\n**Security:**\n\nThe security of the encryption scheme is based on the intractability of the DDH problem. The protocol is designed to ensure that an adversary cannot distinguish between the real encryption process and a simulation that does not use the secret key.\n\n**Channels:**\n\n- `cPK`: Used to send the public key.\n- `cE`: Used to receive plaintext messages for encryption.\n- `cEret`: Used to send the resulting ciphertext.\n- `start`: Used to initiate the protocol.\n\n---\n\nThis description should provide a clear understanding of the ElGamal encryption protocol as described in the cv file.

The protocol involves generating a sequence of public keys (`Opk`) and either computing an encrypted value (`Oy`) or evaluating a boolean function (`OB`) on random values (`x`).\n2. There is an equivalence relation between two sequences of operations that involve key generation, encryption, and the boolean function `B`.\n3. Another part of the protocol involves a sequence of operations where a secret key is used to decrypt a value and then a boolean function is applied to the result.\n\n**Security Query:**\n- The protocol queries the secrecy of a boolean variable `b`, which seems to be involved in the process where encryption and decryption are used in conjunction with the boolean function `B`.\n\n**Process:**\n- `processRealBob` seems to simulate a process where a value `b` is used to determine the order of operations in encryption and decryption, and then the resulting values are compared using the boolean function `B`.\n\n---\n\nThis description is meant to capture the structure and operations of the protocol.

It involves two processes, A and B, which communicate using a symmetric encryption method. The protocol parameters include three large, fixed-length values (N, N2, N3) that are not explicitly used in the provided code but may be relevant to the context in which this protocol is used.\n\n**Types and Functions:**\n\n- `mkey`, `mkeyseed`, `key`, `keyseed`, and `seed` are defined as types with specific constraints (bounded, fixed, large).\n- `keyToBitstring` is a function that converts a `key` into a `bitstring`.\n- `Penc` is a probability distribution used in the encryption process.\n\n**Encryption Scheme:**\n\nThe protocol uses a shared-key encryption scheme, which is assumed to be a CPA (Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure stream cipher. The encryption process (`enc`) and decryption process (`dec`) are not explicitly defined in the ocv file but are assumed to be part of the protocol.\n\n- `keyseed` is used to generate a key (`Kab`) using the function `kgen`.\n- The function `Z` is used to generate a bitstring of the same length as the input, consisting only of zeroes. This is likely used to model the encryption of a zero string.\n\n**Processes:**\n\n- `processA`: This process generates a key (`k2`) and a seed (`s1`) randomly. It then encrypts a message (`Kab`) using the encryption function `enc` with the generated key and seed, and returns the encrypted message (`ea1`).\n- `processB`: This process takes an encrypted message (`ea`) and attempts to decrypt it using the decryption function `dec`. The result of the decryption is not used, and the process returns nothing.\n\n**Protocol Execution:**\n\nThe protocol starts with the generation of a shared key (`Kab`) using a random `keyseed`. The protocol then executes two concurrent loops:\n- The first loop runs `processA` `N` times.\n- The second loop runs `processB` `N` times.\n\nThe protocol is expected to be analyzed for the secrecy of `k3` and one-session secrecy of `k3`. However, the provided output indicates that the tool could not prove the secrecy of `k3`.\n\n---\n\nPlease note that the description above is based on the provided ocv file and assumes that the functions `enc`, `dec`, and `kgen` are part of the protocol's description, even though they are not explicitly defined in the code snippet.

It involves the use of a shared-key encryption scheme (considered a Pseudo-Random Permutation, PRP) and a Message Authentication Code (MAC) for ensuring the integrity of messages exchanged between two parties, A and B.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `N`, `N2`, `N3`: These parameters are placeholders, likely representing the number of instances or iterations of the processes A and B.\n- `mkey`, `mkeyseed`, `key`, `keyseed`, `seed`, `macs`: These types are used to define the various keys, seeds, and MACs involved in the protocol.\n\n**Functions and Probabilities:**\n- `keyToBitstring`: Converts a `key` into a `bitstring` representation.\n- `Penc`, `Pmac`: Probabilities associated with the encryption and MAC procedures, respectively.\n\n**Cryptographic Primitives:**\n- `PRP_cipher`: A shared-key encryption function that takes a `keyseed`, `key`, and other parameters to generate an encrypted message.\n- `SUF_CMA_mac`: A MAC function that generates a MAC for a message using `mkeyseed`, `mkey`, and a `key`.\n\n**Processes:**\n- `processA`: The process executed by party A. It generates a `key` (`k2`), encrypts a message (`Kab`), computes a MAC for the encrypted message, and sends it to party B.\n- `processB`: The process executed by party B. It receives the message and MAC from party A, verifies the MAC, and if it checks out, it decrypts the message to retrieve the original key.\n\n**Communication:**\n- The protocol involves communication over channels `cA`, `cB`, `start`, and `c`. Party A sends an encrypted message and MAC to party B over `cA`, and party B sends an acknowledgment back over `cB`.\n\n**Main Protocol Execution:**\n- The main protocol involves the initialization of a shared key (`Kab`) and MAC key (`mKab`) using `keyseed` and `mkeyseed`, respectively. Then, it creates multiple instances of processes A and B, allowing for concurrent communication between parties.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n- The Cryptoverif tool is expected to analyze the protocol and determine that the secrecy of `k3` cannot be proven, as indicated in the comments at the end of the cv file.\n\n---\n\nPlease note that the above description is based on the provided cv file and assumes that the Cryptoverif tool has successfully analyzed the protocol.

The added comments are meant to provide clarity on sections of the code without altering its functionality."]], "logic": [[true, "Based on the provided cv file, the protocol described appears to be a variant of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange (DHKE) with some additional complexity. The protocol involves the generation of public and private keys and the establishment of a shared secret key between two parties. Here is a description of the protocol:\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The protocol starts with the generation of a set of parameters, including two large prime numbers `p` and `q`, a generator `g` of the multiplicative group modulo `p`, and the order of `g` modulo `q`. These parameters are assumed to be known to all parties.\n\n2. **Key Generation:**\n   - Each party generates a random seed `r` and uses it to derive three values: `pk1`, `pk2`, and `pk3`. These values correspond to the prime `p`, the generator `g`, and the order `q` of the group, respectively.\n\n3. **Key Exchange:**\n   - Each party computes their public key as `g^a mod p`, where `a` is a randomly chosen private value from the set of integers modulo `q`.\n   - The parties exchange their public keys.\n\n4. **Shared Secret Calculation:**\n   - Each party computes the shared secret as `g^(ab) mod p`, where `b` is another randomly chosen private value from the set of integers modulo `q`. This is done by computing `g^b mod p` and then raising it to the power of `a` modulo `p`.\n\n5. **Attack Model:**\n   - The protocol includes an attack model where an attacker can intercept and relay messages but cannot modify them. The goal of the attacker is to compute the shared secret key.\n   - If the attacker computes the correct shared secret key, they are considered to have succeeded, and an event `bad` is triggered.\n\n**CDH Assumptions:**\n- The protocol seems to make use of the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption in various forms (types 1 to 4). These assumptions are used to prove the security of the protocol under the assumption that the CDH problem is hard.\n\n**Channels and Messages:**\n- The protocol uses several communication channels (`c0` to `c7`) for sending messages between the parties involved in the key exchange.\n- Messages include public keys, shared secrets, and other values necessary for the key exchange process.\n\n**Security Proof:**\n- The protocol attempts to prove that the `bad` event (indicating a successful attack) will never occur, based on the CDH assumptions and the computational costs associated with breaking these assumptions.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n- The protocol is expected to be secure, as it should not be possible to prove that the `bad` event can occur, given the CDH assumptions.\n\nThis description is based on the provided cv file and assumes that the reader has some familiarity with the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and cryptographic security proofs.

The protocol has two main entities, A and B, which interact by exchanging encrypted messages and MACs.\n\nParameters:\n- `N`, `N2`, `N3`: Natural numbers that likely represent the number of iterations or the size of some sets within the protocol.\n- `mkey`, `mkeyseed`, `key`, `keyseed`, `seed`, `macs`: These are types representing various cryptographic elements such as keys, seeds, and MACs.\n\nFunctions and Constants:\n- `keyToBitstring`: Converts a key into a bitstring.\n- `Zkey`: A constant bitstring that is used to generate a bitstring of zeroes of the same length as the input bitstring.\n- `Penc`: A probability distribution used for the encryption process.\n- `Pmac`: A probability distribution used for the MAC process.\n\nEncryption:\n- The protocol uses a shared-key encryption scheme that is assumed to be IND-CPA secure. The encryption (`enc`) and decryption (`dec`) functions are defined, along with a key generation function (`kgen`) that takes a `keyseed` as input.\n- The encryption function also uses a `seed` to generate the actual ciphertext (`ea1`), which is then authenticated using a MAC function.\n\nMAC:\n- The MAC mechanism is defined using `mac` for generating MACs and `check` for verifying MACs. A MAC key generation function (`mkgen`) is also defined, taking a `mkeyseed` as input.\n\nProtocol Execution:\n- The protocol starts with the generation of a shared key (`Kab`) and a MAC key (`mKab`) using random seeds (`rKab` and `rmKab`).\n- Process A (OA) generates a key (`k2`), a seed (`s1`), encrypts a message, and computes a MAC for that message.\n- Process B (OB) receives an encrypted message (`ea`) and a MAC (`ma`), and checks if the MAC is correct. If so, it attempts to decrypt the message.\n- The protocol is executed with `N` instances of Process A and `N` instances of Process B running concurrently.\n\nQueries:\n- The protocol includes queries for `secret1` and `secret` related to `k2` and `k3`, which are likely used to check the secrecy properties of these keys.\n\nExpected Result:\n- The CryptoVerif tool is expected to output that it \"Could not prove secrecy of k3,\" indicating that the protocol does not ensure the confidentiality of `k3`.\n\nThis description should give you a good starting point to create an ocv file.

This description will aim to be detailed enough that someone familiar with the Cryptoverif tool could generate a corresponding cv file from it.\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\nThe protocol described in the provided cv file is a simple symmetric encryption and message authentication code (MAC) verification protocol. It involves two processes, A and B, which communicate over channels. The protocol is parameterized by three values, N, N2, and N3, and uses several types and functions to define the operations and properties of the system.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `N`, `N2`, `N3`: These are parameters that likely control the scope or bounds of certain operations within the protocol, such as the number of processes or the size of certain types.\n\n**Types:**\n- `mkey`, `mkeyseed`, `key`, `keyseed`, `seed`, `macs`: These are user-defined types that represent the keys, seeds, and MACs used in the protocol.\n\n**Functions:**\n- `keyToBitstring(key)`: Converts a key into a bitstring representation.\n- `enc(key, plaintext, seed)`: Encryption function that takes a key, plaintext, and a seed to produce a ciphertext.\n- `dec(ciphertext, key)`: Decryption function that takes a ciphertext and a key to produce plaintext.\n- `mac(message, key)`: MAC generation function that takes a message and a key to produce a MAC.\n- `check(message, key, mac)`: Verification function that checks if a given MAC is correct for a message and key.\n\n**Probabilities:**\n- `Penc`: Represents the probability distribution for encryption.\n- `Pmac`: Represents the probability distribution for MAC generation.\n\n**Protocol Execution:**\n\n1. The protocol starts with a process that listens on the `start` channel.\n2. It generates two keys, `Kab` for encryption and `mKab` for MAC, using random seeds `rKab` and `rmKab` respectively.\n3. Two parallel processes are spawned `N` times each:\n   - **Process A**: Listens on the `cA` channel, generates a random key `k2` and seed `s1`, encrypts a message using `Kab`, computes the MAC of the ciphertext, and emits an event `beginA` with the ciphertext and MAC. It then sends the ciphertext and MAC to process B.\n   - **Process B**: Listens on the `cB` channel, receives a ciphertext and MAC, checks if the MAC is valid using `mKab`, and if so, emits an event `endB` with the ciphertext and MAC.\n\n**Queries and Events:**\n- The protocol includes queries for secrets `k2`, `k3`, and `secret1`, which are likely used to check the secrecy properties of these values.\n- Events `beginA` and `endB` are emitted by processes A and B, respectively, to indicate the start and end of communication between the processes.\n\n**Channels:**\n- The protocol uses three channels, `cA` for communication from process A to B, `cB` for communication from process B to A, and `start` to initiate the protocol.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n- The comment at the end of the file indicates that the expected result of the verification is that the secrecy of `k3` could not be proven. This suggests that the protocol may have a vulnerability that allows an attacker to learn `k3`.\n\nThis description should provide a comprehensive overview of the protocol, which could be used to recreate the provided cv file using the Cryptoverif tool."]]}, "CV-1/bug-otheruses-hash.cv": {"code": [[true, "(* \nBug related to simplify/otheruses: the event termS is finally\nremoved\n\n(* Additional notation for the hash function *)\nfun hash(G, nonce):thash {\n  /* The hash function combines a group element and a nonce to produce a hash value. */\n  return some h: thash such that /* The conditions under which 'h' is a valid hash output. */\n}\n\nproof {\ncrypto hash;\nsimplify;\nsimplify;\nauto\n}\n\n(* set interactiveMode = true. *)\n\nparam NU, NS, NP.\n\ntype G [large, fixed].\ntype nonce [large, fixed].\ntype thash [large, fixed].\n\ntype host [bounded].\n\n(* Hash functions in the random oracle model *)\n\nparam N, qH.\n\nfun hash(G, nonce):thash.\n\nequiv (x1: G, x2: nonce) N -> hash(x1, x2) [all]\n      <=(0)=>\n      (x1: G, x2: nonce) N -> find[unique] j <= N suchthat defined(x1[j],x2[j],r[j]) && otheruses(r[j]) && x1 = x1[j] && x2 = x2[j] then r[j] else\n\t\t\t new r:thash; r.\n\nchannel c10, c20.\n\nlet hash_oracle = ! qH in(c10, (x1: G, x2: nonce)); out(c20, hash(x1,x2)). \n\n(* Queries *)\n\nchannel c1, c2, c3, c4, c5, c6, c7, c8, c9, cp,\n\tstart, finish.\n\nconst U : host.\nconst S : host.\n\nevent termS.\n\nquery \n\tevent termS ==> false.\n\n(* Client process notation *)\nlet processU =\n\tin(c1, ());\n\tnew X: G;\n\t/* The client generates a new group element X and sends it to the server. */\n\tout(c2, (U, X));\n        in(c5, (=S, Ystar_u: G));\n\tlet Y_u:thash = hash(Ystar_u, pw) in\n\t/* The client receives a group element from the server and hashes it with the password. */\n\tout(c6, ()).\n\n(* Server process notation *)\nlet processS =\n\tin(c3, (=U, X_s: G));\n\tnew Ystar: G;\n\t/* The server generates a new group element Ystar and sends its hash to the client. */\n\tlet Y = hash(Ystar, pw) in\n\tout(c4, (S, Ystar));\n\tin(c7, ());\n\t/* The server looks for a match between the received group element and the hashed value. */\n\tfind j <= NU suchthat defined(X[j],Y_u[j]) && X[j] = X_s && Y_u[j] = Y then\n\tevent termS.\n\nprocess \n\tin(start, ());\n\tnew pw: nonce;\n\tout(c8, ());\n\t/* The system starts with the initialization of a password and then runs the client and server processes concurrently. */\n\t((!

If such an index is found, the event `termS` is triggered.\n\n7. **Protocol Execution:**\n   - The protocol executes with the client and server processes running in parallel, along with the hash oracle.\n   - The `process` block combines the client, server, and hash oracle interactions.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n- The protocol is expected to not terminate with the event `termS` being true. However, the provided cv file indicates that the protocol could not be proven to satisfy this property, as the verification resulted in a failure.\n\nThis description should give you a good starting point to create a cv file.

It is based on the ElGamal encryption method but incorporates hashing to enhance its security properties.\n\n#### Parameters:\n- `n`: This parameter likely represents the security level or the bit length of the keys used in the protocol.\n- `q`: The size of the group `G` in which the protocol's operations are performed.\n- `nH`: The number of possible queries to the hash function `h`.\n- `nCDH`: The number of CDH problem queries an adversary is allowed to make.\n- `nCDH'`: This might denote a variant or a different count of CDH problem queries.\n\n#### Types:\n- `Z`: Represents the set of integers modulo `n`, used for exponents in the group `G`.\n- `G`: The group in which the cryptographic operations are performed, typically a cyclic group of prime order `q`.\n- `K`: The type representing the keys used in the protocol, which are considered large and fixed.\n- `D`: A type for the domain of the hash function `h`.\n\n#### Constants and Functions:\n- `gamma`: A generator of the group `G`.\n- `exp(G,Z)`: A function that computes the exponentiation in the group `G`.\n- `mult(Z,Z)`: A multiplication function for elements of `Z`, assumed to be commutative.\n- `xor(D,D)`: A bitwise XOR function for elements of `D`, which has the property that XORing an element with itself results in the identity element.\n- `h(K,G)`: A hash function mapping a key from `K` and an element from `G` to an element in `D`.\n\n#### Assumptions:\n- **Commutativity of Multiplication**: Multiplication of exponents in the group is commutative.\n- **One-Time Pad Property**: XOR with a random element is a one-time pad, which is information-theoretically secure.\n- **CDH Assumption**: It is computationally infeasible to compute the CDH of two group elements given their exponents.\n\n#### Processes:\n- **Encryption Process (`processE`)**:\n  - Inputs a pair of messages `(m0, m1)` and a boolean `b`.\n  - Selects one of the messages based on `b` using the `choose` function.\n  - Generates a random exponent `y` and computes `beta` and `delta` using `gamma` and the random exponent.\n  - Hashes `delta` using the hash function `h` to get `hash`.\n  - XORs `hash` with the chosen message to produce `v`.\n  - Outputs the pair `(beta, v)` as the encrypted message.\n\n- **Hashing Process (`processH`)**:\n  - Inputs an element `xH` from the group `G`.\n  - Outputs the hash of `xH` using the hash function `h`.\n\n- **Main Process**:\n  - Generates a random exponent `x` and a key `k`.\n  - Computes `alpha` using `gamma` and the random exponent `x`.\n  - Outputs `alpha` as the public key.\n  - Parallely runs the encryption process `processE` and the hashing process `processH`.\n\nThe cv file includes the expected result of the protocol verification, indicating that all queries have been proved secure, and it provides timing and memory usage information for the verification process.\n\nTo generate a corresponding cv file from this description, one would need to translate each of these components into the Cryptoverif syntax, ensuring that the functions, types, and processes are correctly defined and the assumptions properly stated. The provided cv file already represents this description, so it serves as the input for the Cryptoverif tool to verify the protocol's security properties."]]}, "CV-1/ind_cca2.cv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n * Explanation of the cv file: This file defines a simple     *\n * encryption scheme with probabilistic encryption and        *\n * decryption functions.

It involves the generation of public and private keys, encryption of cleartext messages, and decryption of ciphertexts. The protocol is analyzed using the CryptoVerif tool to ensure its security properties, particularly under an adaptive chosen ciphertext attack (CCA2).\n\n**Types and Parameters:**\n\n- `pkey`: Represents a public key, which is bounded (i.e., has a limited size or range).\n- `skey`: Represents a private key, also bounded.\n- `keyseed`: A fixed-size seed used for generating keys.\n- `cleartext`: The type for plaintext messages.\n- `ciphertext`: The type for encrypted messages.\n- `enc_seed`: A bounded type representing a seed used during the encryption process.\n- `N` and `N2`: Parameters that likely represent the number of encryption and decryption operations, respectively.\n\n**Functions and Probabilities:**\n\n- `Z(cleartext)`: A function that likely returns the original cleartext (no transformation).\n- `enc(cleartext, pkey, enc_seed)`: Encrypts a cleartext message using a public key and an encryption seed to produce a ciphertext.\n- `skgen(keyseed)`: Generates a private key from a keyseed.\n- `pkgen(keyseed)`: Generates a public key from a keyseed.\n- `dec(ciphertext, skey)`: Decrypts a ciphertext using a private key to return a bitstringbot (bottom type for bits, indicating a successful decryption).\n- `injbot(cleartext)`: Transforms a cleartext message into a bitstringbot, likely used for decryption.\n- `Penc`: Probability of encryption, which seems to be a parameter related to the time complexity of the encryption operation.\n\n**Security Property:**\n\nThe protocol must satisfy the following security property:\n\n- For all cleartext messages `m`, keyseeds `k`, and encryption seeds `r`, the decryption of an encrypted message using the corresponding private key should result in the original message transformed into a bitstringbot. This is expressed by the equation:\n\n  ```\n  dec(enc(m, pkgen(k), r), skgen(k)) = injbot(m)\n  ```\n\n**Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack (CCA2) Security:**\n\nThe protocol is also analyzed under an CCA2, which involves the following steps:\n\n1. A keyseed `k` is randomly chosen.\n2. A public key is generated and provided to the adversary.\n3. The adversary can request the decryption of up to `N2` ciphertexts, which may include the generation of fresh ciphertexts by encrypting new messages up to `N` times.\n4. The protocol must ensure that the probability of the adversary successfully decrypting a ciphertext (i.e., returning the correct cleartext) is bounded by a certain probability, which depends on the time complexity of the encryption and the number of decryption queries (`N * Penc(time + (N-1) * time(enc, maxlength(m)), N2)`).\n\n**Process:**\n\n- The process starts with the generation of a keyseed, followed by the generation of a public key.\n- The protocol includes a loop for handling decryption queries (`Odec`), where it checks if the ciphertext exists in a table (`cipher`) and returns the corresponding cleartext if found, or performs decryption otherwise.\n- For encryption queries (`Oenc`), the protocol encrypts a transformed cleartext (using `Z(m)`) and inserts the resulting ciphertext into the `cipher` table.\n\nThis description should provide enough information to generate a corresponding cv file that can be run by the CryptoVerif tool.

It involves the following components and properties:\n\n### Types\n- `cleartext`: This type represents the plaintext messages that the protocol will encrypt.\n- `ciphertext`: This type represents the encrypted messages, which are the outputs of the encryption function.\n- `key`: This type represents the encryption keys, which are bounded (finite set of possible keys).\n- `enc_seed`: This type represents seeds used for the encryption function and are also bounded.\n\n### Functions\n- `enc(cleartext, key, enc_seed)`: This function takes a plaintext message, an encryption key, and an encryption seed as inputs and produces a ciphertext as output. It is the encryption function of the protocol.\n- `Z(cleartext)`: This function seems to represent a transformation applied to the plaintext, possibly a zeroization function that sets the input to a default or zero value. It is used in the equivalence statement.\n\n### Parameters\n- `N`: This parameter likely represents the number of encryption operations to be performed within the protocol.\n- `Penc`: This parameter represents a probability distribution that is related to the encryption time, the number of encryption operations (`N`), and the maximum length of the plaintext (`maxlength(x)`).\n\n### Equivalence Statement\nThe main statement in the cv file is an equivalence (`equiv`) that specifies the IND-CPA security of the encryption scheme. The statement is as follows:\n\n```\nequiv(ind_cpa(enc))\n  k <-R key; \n  foreach i <= N do \n    r <-R enc_seed; \n    Oenc(x:cleartext) :=  return(enc(x, k, r)) \n<=(Penc(time, N, maxlength(x)))=> \n  k <-R key;\n  foreach i <= N do \n  r <-R enc_seed; \n  Oenc(x:cleartext) := return(enc(Z(x), k, r)).\n```\n\nThis equivalence states that the encryption function `enc` should be indistinguishable from an ideal encryption function under the conditions of the IND-CPA game.

The output of the encryption function `Oenc` should be computationally indistinguishable from the encryption of a transformed plaintext `Z(x)` under the same key and seed, given the probability distribution `Penc`.\n\n### Process\nFinally, the `process 0` statement indicates that there is a single process in the protocol, numbered 0. This process likely represents the entity performing the encryption.\n\nBased on this description, the cv file could be reconstructed with the provided types, functions, parameters, the equivalence statement for IND-CPA, and the indication of a single process.

The protocol aims to verify the correctness of cryptographic signatures within a computational model using the Cryptoverif tool. The protocol does not implement the more efficient reduction by J.S. Coron because it does not assume random self-reducibility.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **One-Way Trapdoor Permutation:**\n   - The protocol uses a one-way trapdoor permutation (`OW_trapdoor_perm`) that takes a `keyseed`, `pkey` (public key), `skey` (secret key), and `D` (domain). It includes functions for key generation (`pkgen` and `skgen`), the permutation function `f`, and a mask function `mf`. The probability of this permutation is denoted as `pOW`.\n\n2. **Hash Function:**\n   - A hash function is used, modeled as a random oracle in the computational model (`ROM_hash_large`). It takes a `hashkey`, an input `bitstring`, and the domain `D`. The hash function is denoted as `hash`, and the oracle is `hashoracle`. The number of queries to the hash function is denoted as `qH`.\n\n3. **Protocol Processes:**\n   - **Process S (Signer):**\n     - This process generates a new seed (`sr`) and computes a message authentication code (MAC) using the mask function `mf` and the hash of the concatenation of the input message `m` and the seed `sr`. It then sends the seed and the MAC to the receiver via channel `c2`.\n   - **Process T (Verifier):**\n     - This process receives a message `m2`, a seed `sr`, and a value `s` from the domain `D`. It checks if the signature (computed using the public key `pk`, the value `s`, and the hash of `(m2,sr)`) is valid. If the signature is valid and matches one of the previously seen messages (within the limit `qS`), it yields; otherwise, it triggers a \"bad\" event.\n\n4. **Main Process:**\n   - The main process initializes the hash key `hk`, the keyseed `r`, the secret key `sk`, and the public key `pk`. It then outputs the public key and starts the `hashoracle`, `processS`, and `processT`.\n\n**Protocol Execution:**\n\n- The protocol is executed with an initial input via the `start` channel.\n- The `hashoracle` simulates the hash function as a random oracle.\n- The `processS` and `processT` communicate over channels `c1`, `c2`, and `c3` to perform the signature generation and verification, respectively.\n\n**Security Expectation:**\n\n- The protocol is expected to prove all queries without any \"bad\" events occurring, indicating that the verification of signatures is secure against the defined attacks within the protocol's constraints.\n\n---\n\nThis description should provide enough information to reconstruct the provided cv file for use with the Cryptoverif tool.

Below is a high-level description of the protocol:\n\n**Protocol Description:**\n\n1. **Key Generation (`cca_gen` function):**\n   - Input: A hash key `hk2` and a random seed `k` for the KEM.\n   - Actions:\n     - Generate a random value `z` of type `B`.\n     - Derive a CPA key seed from the KEM seed `k` using the `kem_to_cpa_seed` function.\n     - Generate a CPA public key `pk` and a CPA secret key `sk'` from the CPA key seed.\n     - Concatenate `sk'`, `pk`, `H1(hk2, pk)`, and `z` to form the KEM secret key `sk`.\n     - Output: A `KEM_KeyPair` containing the public key `pk` and the secret key `sk`.\n\n2. **Encryption (`cca_encaps` function):**\n   - Input: Hash keys `hk`, `hk2`, `hk3`, a CPA public key `pk`, and a random seed `k` for the KEM.\n   - Actions:\n     - Convert the KEM seed `k` to a type `B` value `m'` using `kseedToB`.\n     - Hash `m'` with `hk2` to get `m`.\n     - Compute a key `Kt` using `G1`.\n     - Derive a random value `r` for encryption using `G2`.\n     - Encrypt `m` with `pk` and `r` to get a CPA ciphertext `c`.\n     - Output: A pair of the CPA ciphertext `c` and a KEM encapsulated secret `KEMEncaps(c, KDF(hk, Kt, H3(hk2, c)))`.\n\n3. **Decryption (`cca_decap` function):**\n   - Input: Hash keys `hk`, `hk2`, `hk3`, a CPA ciphertext `c`, and a KEM secret key `sk`.\n   - Actions:\n     - Decompose `sk` into its components `sk'`, `pk`, `h`, and `z`.\n     - Decrypt `c` with `sk'` to get `m'`.\n     - Compute `Kt'` using `G1` and derive `r'` using `G2`.\n     - Encrypt `m'` with `pk` and `r'` to get `c'`.\n     - If `secb` is true, return the result of `cca_decap` as `KDF(hk, Kt', H3(hk2, c'))`.\n     - If `secb` is false, check if `c` matches `c'` and `pk'` matches `pk`. If both conditions are true, return `KDF(hk, Kt', H3(hk2, c'))`; otherwise, return `nullsec`.\n\n4. **Security Proof:**\n   - The protocol involves proving the security of the KEM in the presence of hash oracles for `hashoracleKDF`, `hashoracleH`, and `hashoracleG1`.\n   - The `query secret secb` line indicates that there is a secret value `secb` involved in the protocol, which is used to determine the behavior during decryption.\n   - The `Start` process initializes the necessary variables and runs the protocol, with the option to handle hash oracle queries.\n\nThis description captures the essence of the protocol as described in the ocv file.

Below is a description of the protocol based on the given Cryptoverif code:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Overview\nThe protocol is an encryption scheme that employs a probabilistic encryption method to ensure CPA security. It uses a pair of algorithms for key generation, encryption, and decryption, along with hash functions modeled as random oracles. The protocol involves the generation of public and secret keys, encryption and decryption processes, and a method to handle encryption queries.\n\n#### Components\n- **Crypto ROMs (Random Oracles):** Two random oracles, H and G, are used for hashing operations. These oracles are modeled as non-interactive and are used to provide the necessary properties for the proof of CPA security.\n- **Trapdoor Permutation:** The protocol uses a partial-domain one-way trapdoor permutation (PD-OW) to ensure the encryption scheme's security properties. The permutation has a trapdoor that allows for inversion, which is essential for decryption.\n- **Key Generation:** The protocol involves the generation of a public key (`pkey`) and a secret key (`skey`) based on a random seed (`seed`).\n- **Hash Functions:** The protocol uses hash functions to process data before encryption and decryption. These functions are assumed to be secure in the random oracle model.\n- **Concatenation Function:** A function `concatm` is used to concatenate two data types, `Dm` and `Dz`, into a `Dow` type, which is necessary for the encryption process.\n- **XOR Operations:** XOR operations are used to combine and manipulate data during the encryption and decryption processes.\n- **Test Function:** The `test` function is used to conditionally select between two data elements based on a boolean value, which is crucial for the protocol's logic without expanding conditional statements that would complicate the proof.\n- **Channels:** The protocol uses channels (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`) to simulate communication between entities.\n\n#### Process\n1. **Key Generation:** A random seed is generated, and based on this seed, a public and secret key are produced using the `pkgen` and `skgen` functions.\n2. **Handling Queries:** The protocol processes encryption queries (`secret1`) by taking two data elements (`m1` and `m2`) as input.\n3. **Encryption:** The protocol uses a combination of hash functions, concatenation, and XOR operations to encrypt the input data (`m1` and `m2`) based on the public key (`pk`) and the random oracles.\n4. **Output:** The encrypted data is outputted through channel `c2`.\n\n#### Security Proof\nThe protocol aims to prove CPA security by showing that an adversary cannot distinguish between the encryption of two chosen plaintexts with non-negligible probability. The proof involves the use of the random oracle model and the properties of the PD-OW permutation.\n\n#### Expected Result\nThe expected result of running this protocol in the Cryptoverif tool is that all queries are proved, indicating that the protocol is secure against CPA under the assumptions made.\n\nThis description should provide a basis for generating a corresponding cv file that can be run by the Cryptoverif tool.

It involves two entities, A (the prover) and B (the verifier), who engage in a series of message exchanges to authenticate each other. The protocol uses cryptographic primitives such as public and private keys, nonces, and digital signatures to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the communication.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `N`, `N2`, `N3`, `N4`: These parameters are not explicitly used in the provided code but are declared, possibly for future use or for defining the bounds of types.\n- `nonce`: A type representing a nonce, which is a random or pseudo-random number that is generated for each new communication instance to prevent replay attacks.\n- `host`: A bounded type representing a host or an entity within the protocol.\n- `pkey` and `skey`: Types representing public and private keys, respectively.\n- `keyseed`: A large and fixed type representing a seed used to generate the keys.\n- `seed`: A fixed type representing a seed for generating signatures.\n- `signature`: A bounded type representing digital signatures.\n- `blocksize` and `blocksizebot`: Types representing the size of blocks of data, with `blocksize` being fixed and `blocksizebot` bounded.\n\n**Functions and Probabilities:**\n- `concat1`: A function that concatenates a public key, a host, and a nonce into a block of data.\n- `Psign` and `Psigncoll`: Probabilities representing the probability of successful signature generation and the probability of successful existential forgery under a chosen-message attack, respectively.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n1. Entity B generates a nonce `n` and sends it along with its identity `B` to entity A.\n2. Entity A receives the message and generates a new random seed `r`.\n3. Entity A signs the concatenation of its public key `pkA`, B's identity, and the received nonce `xN` using its private key `skA` and the random seed `r`.\n4. Entity A sends the signature to entity B.\n5. Entity B receives the signature and verifies it using the received public key `xpkA` (which should match `pkA`) and the expected concatenation of `xpkA`, its own identity `B`, and the nonce `n`.\n6. If the signature checks out, and if `xpkA` matches `pkA`, entity B fires an event `eB` indicating successful authentication.\n\n**Cryptographic Primitives:**\n- `skgen` and `pkgen`: Functions that generate private and public keys from a keyseed.\n- `sign`: A function used by entity A to create a signature over the concatenation of the public key, the host, and the nonce.\n- `check`: A function used by entity B to verify the signature provided by entity A.\n\n**Channels and Events:**\n- The protocol uses multiple channels (`c0` to `c13`) for communication between the entities, though not all channels are used in the provided code.\n- Two events, `eA` and `eB`, are defined to indicate the sending of messages by entities A and B, respectively.\n- Two queries are set up to check for the correctness of the protocol by asserting that if B sends a message, A should eventually receive it, and vice versa.\n\nThe protocol is set up with a process that starts by generating a keyseed for entity A, deriving its public and private keys, and then running the processes for A and B in parallel (`processA` and `processB`).\n\nThis description should provide enough information to create a corresponding cv file that could be run by the Cryptoverif tool. The cv file encodes the protocol's structure, the cryptographic primitives used, the communication pattern, and the properties to be verified."]]}}
