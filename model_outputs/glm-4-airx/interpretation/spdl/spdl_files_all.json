Below is a description of the protocol content:\n\n1. **DH Protocol**:\n   - This protocol is used for establishing a shared secret key between two parties.\n   - It involves two roles: `DH`.\n   - Each role generates a nonce (`i` for one party and `r` for the other).\n   - They exchange messages containing the hash of their nonces combined with a function `g` applied to their respective nonces.\n\n2. **SWAP Protocol**:\n   - This protocol is used for swapping values between two parties.\n   - It involves two roles: `SWAP`.\n   - Each role generates a nonce (`i` for one party and `r` for the other) and a ticket (`Ni` for one party and `Nr` for the other).\n   - They exchange messages containing the result of a KDF (key derivation function) applied to the hash of their nonces combined with the function `g`.\n\n3. **Executability Protocol**:\n   - This protocol is used for ensuring the executability of operations.\n   - It involves one role: `O`.\n   - The role `O` sends and receives messages containing MACs (message authentication codes) based on the hash of nonces and the function `g`.\n\n4. **sts-mac Protocol**:\n   - This protocol is the main protocol for secure communication.\n   - It involves two roles: `I` ( Initiator) and `R` (Responder).\n   - The Initiator (`I`) sends a message containing `g(i)` to the Responder (`R`).\n   - The Responder (`R`) sends a message containing a ticket `Gr` and a MAC to the Initiator.\n   - The Initiator then sends a message containing a ticket and a MAC to the Responder.\n   - Both parties make claims about the existence of certain keys and the fact that they are alive and have a weak agreement on the shared secret.\n\nThe SPDL file describes the structure and behavior of these protocols, including the roles, messages sent, and the operations performed on the messages. It uses a formalized language to specify the cryptographic operations (like hashing, MAC computation, and key derivation) and the flow of messages between the roles.

It does not include the specific details of the cryptographic operations, which are implied by the use of `pk` for encryption and the claims made by each role regarding the secrecy of their keys.\n\nTo generate the corresponding spdl file from this description, one would need to ensure that the structure of the protocol, roles, messages, and claims match exactly what is provided in the original spdl content.

This description will be detailed enough that someone familiar with SPDL could regenerate the corresponding SPDL file.\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Description: Woo and Lam Mutual Authentication**\n\nThe Woo and Lam Mutual Authentication protocol is designed to provide mutual authentication between two entities, I ( Initiator ) and R ( Responder ), with the assistance of a trusted server S. This protocol is a basic authentication exchange, ensuring that both I and R can verify each other's identities using a shared secret key and nonces to prevent replay attacks.\n\n**Roles:**\n\n1. ** Initiator (I) **: The entity that starts the authentication process.\n2. **Responder (R) **: The entity that responds to the Initiator's authentication attempt.\n3. **Server (S) **: A trusted third party that helps establish a secure session key between I and R.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. ** Initiator (I) ** generates a fresh nonce (N1) and sends it to Responder (R).\n   \n   ```spdl\n   send_1(I,R, I, N1);\n   ```\n\n2. Responder (R) receives the nonce (N1) and generates a fresh nonce (N2) to send back to the Initiator (I).\n   \n   ```spdl\n   send_2(R,I, R, N2);\n   ```\n\n3. Initiator (I) receives nonce (N2) and sends a message encrypted with its key shared with the Server (S) containing the identifiers of I and R, and both nonces (N1 and N2).\n   \n   ```spdl\n   send_3(I,R, {I, R, N1, N2}k(I,S));\n   ```\n\n4. Responder (R) receives the message from Initiator (I) and forwards it to Server (S) for verification along with its own identifier and a nonce.\n   \n   ```spdl\n   send_4(R,S, T1, {I, R, N1, N2}k(R,S));\n   ```\n\n5. Server (S) receives the message from Responder (R) and the Initiator's message, both encrypted with their respective keys. It generates a session key (Kir) and sends a message back to Responder (R) containing this session key, encrypted with both keys.\n   \n   ```spdl\n   send_5(S,R, {R, N1, N2, Kir}k(I,S), {I, N1, N2, Kir}k(R,S));\n   ```\n\n6. Responder (R) receives the message from Server (S), decrypts it, and sends the session key (Kir) to Initiator (I), encrypted with the session key.\n   \n   ```spdl\n   send_6(R,I, T2, {N1,N2}Kir);\n   ```\n\n7. Initiator (I) receives the message, decrypts the session key (Kir), and sends back a message encrypted with the session key to confirm the successful establishment of a secure communication channel.\n   \n   ```spdl\n   send_7(I,R, {N2}Kir);\n   ```\n\n**Claims:**\n\n- Initiator (I) claims that the session key (Kir) is secret, the nonces are synchronized (Nisynch), and the session key is fresh (Fresh,Kir).\n  \n  ```spdl\n  claim_I1(I,Secret,Kir);\n  claim_I2(I,Nisynch);\n  claim_I3(I,Empty,(Fresh,Kir));\n  ```\n\n- Responder (R) also claims that the session key (Kir) is secret, the nonces are synchronized (Nisynch), and the session key is fresh (Fresh,Kir).\n  \n  ```spdl\n  claim_R1(R,Secret,Kir);\n  claim_R2(R,Nisynch);\n  claim_R3(R,Empty,(Fresh,Kir));\n  ```\n\nThis description outlines the basic flow and the claims made by the roles within the Woo and Lam Mutual Authentication protocol.

It involves two roles, an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R), and is designed to establish a shared secret key between them.\n\n**Roles and Variables:**\n\n1. **Initiator (I)**\n   - **Variables:**\n     - `x`: A fresh nonce generated by the Initiator.\n     - `i`: A nonce variable used within the Initiator's role.\n     - `beta`: A ticket variable used to hold a value received from the Responder.\n   - **Actions:**\n     - Sends a compromise message containing `x` to itself.\n     - Sends a message to the Responder containing `g1(x)` (where `g1` is a hash function applied to `x`), the Responder's identifier, and a signature of the message.\n     - Receives a message from the Responder that includes `g1(x)`, `beta`, `i`, and the Initiator's identifier, signed by the Responder.\n     - Sends a message to the Responder with the hash of `g2(beta, x)` (where `g2` is another hash function applied to `beta` and `x`).\n     - Claims to possess the shared key `g2(beta, x)`.\n\n2. **Responder (R)**\n   - **Variables:**\n     - `y`: A fresh nonce generated by the Responder.\n     - `i`: A nonce variable used within the Responder's role.\n     - `alpha`: A ticket variable used to hold a value sent by the Initiator.\n   - **Actions:**\n     - Sends a compromise message containing `y` and `i` to itself.\n     - Receives a message from the Initiator that includes `alpha` (a ticket), the Responder's identifier, and a signature of the message.\n     - Sends a message to the Initiator that includes `alpha`, `g1(y)`, `i`, and the Initiator's identifier, signed by the Responder.\n     - Receives a message from the Initiator with the hash of `g2(alpha, y)`.\n     - Claims to possess the shared key `g2(alpha, y)`.\n\n**Helper Protocol: Exponentiation**\n\nThere is a helper protocol named `@exponentiation` used to simulate the commutative property of exponentiation in protocols (i.e., `g^ab = g^ba`). This protocol is not directly involved in the twoDHiso-prf protocol but is used internally by Scyther for the purpose of displaying and protocol analysis.\n\n**Hash Functions:**\n\n- `h1`: A hash function used for generating the Initiator's signature.\n- `h2`: A hash function used for generating the Responder's signature.\n- `g1`: A hash function applied in the Initiator's message.\n- `g2`: A hash function applied in the Responder's message.\n\n**Security Claims:**\n\nBoth the Initiator and Responder claim to possess the shared secret key after the protocol execution, which is the result of the pseudo-random function applied to their respective nonces (`g2(beta, x)` for the Initiator and `g2(alpha, y)` for the Responder).\n\n---\n\nThis description should provide a comprehensive overview of the protocol, which could be used to reconstruct the SPDL file. The description omits some of the more technical SPDL-specific syntax, such as the use of the `recv_!` and `send_!` actions to denote outputs and inputs that are not part of the main protocol flow but are used for analysis purposes. However, it captures the essence of the protocol's operation and the roles and variables involved."]]}, "SPDL-1/HMQV.spdl": {"code": [[false, "To add notations to this SPDL file, we need to specify the roles, messages, and variables involved in the protocol for clarity.

It assumes that either the environment disallows certain types of attacks or that a unidirectional key is used if the identity of B is omitted.\n\nThe protocol has two roles, A and B, which represent the two entities participating in the communication.\n\n**Role A:**\n- Role A generates a nonce `T` and a ticket `Text`.\n- A receives a message from B, which contains the nonce `T`, the identity of A, and the ticket `Text`, all encrypted with a symmetric key shared between A and B (`k(A,B)`).\n- A then sends a message back to B, containing the same nonce `T`, the identity of A, and the ticket `Text`, encrypted with a symmetric key shared between B and A (`k(B,A)`).\n\n**Role B:**\n- Role B acts similarly to Role A, generating its own nonce `T` and ticket `Text`.\n- B receives a message from A, which contains the nonce `T`, the identity of B, and the ticket `Text`, all encrypted with a symmetric key shared between A and B (`k(A,B)`).\n- B then sends a message back to A, containing the same nonce `T`, the identity of B, and the ticket `Text`, encrypted with a symmetric key shared between B and A (`k(B,A)`).\n\n**isoiec-9798-2-1 Protocol:**\n- This protocol is an extension of the previous protocol and involves additional claims and freshness guarantees.\n- Role A generates two fresh values: a nonce `TNA` and two tickets `Text1` and `Text2`.\n- A makes a claim about running the protocol with B using the nonce `TNA` and ticket `Text1`.\n- A sends a message to B, including `Text2` and a message encrypted with the shared key `k(A,B)` containing `TNA`, the identity of B, and `Text1`.\n- Role B receives this message, extracts `TNA` and `Text1`, and makes claims about the commitment to the protocol, its liveness, and a weak agreement with A.\n\n**Freshness and Claims:**\n- Freshness is indicated by the use of fresh nonces and tickets, which helps in preventing replay attacks.\n- Claims made by roles include commitments to certain states, liveness (indicating that the entity is currently active), and weak agreement (which typically implies some level of agreement on a shared value without fully revealing it).\n\nBased on this description, a corresponding SPDL file could be manually crafted to reflect the roles, message exchanges, and freshness of values. However, the actual translation from the description back to SPDL syntax would require careful attention to the syntax and structure expected by the Scyther tool."]]}, "SPDL-1/KAS1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/* \n * KEA+ Protocol with additional notations\n */\n\n// Hash functions\nhashfunction h1,h2,g1,g2;\n\n// ...

These helper protocols are not directly involved in the main KEA+ protocol but are used by Scyther for analysis purposes.\n\n---\n\nThis description captures the essence of the KEA+ protocol as described in the SPDL file.

The message contains the original nonce `ni`, the new nonce `nr`, and the Responder's identity `R`.\n\n   ```plaintext\n   R -> I: {ni, nr, R}PK(I)\n   ```\n\n3. **Final Message from Initiator (I)**\n   - The Initiator (I) receives the message from the Responder, decrypts it with its private key, and extracts the nonces `ni` and `nr`, and the Responder's identity `R`.\n   - I sends a message to R encrypted with R's public key containing the new nonce `nr`.\n\n   ```plaintext\n   I -> R: {nr}PK(R)\n   ```\n\n**Claims:**\n\n- The Initiator (I) claims the following:\n  - `claim_i1(I,Secret,ni)`: The nonce `ni` is a secret.\n  - `claim_i2(I,Secret,nr)`: The nonce `nr` is a secret.\n  - `claim_i3(I,Niagree)`: There is an agreement on the nonce `ni`.\n  - `claim_i4(I,Nisynch)`: The Initiator and Responder are synchronized on the nonce `ni`.\n\n- The Responder (R) claims the following:\n  - `claim_r1(R,Secret,ni)`: The nonce `ni` is a secret.\n  - `claim_r2(R,Secret,nr)`: The nonce `nr` is a secret.\n  - `claim_r3(R,Niagree)`: There is an agreement on the nonce `ni`.\n  - `claim_r4(R,Nisynch)`: The Initiator and Responder are synchronized on the nonce `ni`.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a high-level overview of the protocol's operation.

The protocol ensures that both parties can agree on a shared secret key while providing authentication and integrity.\n\n**Roles:**\n\n1. ** Initiator (I) **:\n   - Generates a fresh nonce `s` and a fresh nonce `x`.\n   - Claims the Session ID (SID) by sending `s`.\n   - Sends a message to Responder (R) containing `I`, `s`, and `g^x`, where `g` is a generator of the group and `x` is the Initiator's private key.\n   - Receives a message from Responder, which includes `R`, `s`, a ticket `beta`, and a signature over these values.\n   - Sends a message to Responder with a signature over `I`, `s`, `g^x`, `beta`, and `R`.\n   - Claims the Shared Key (SKR) by computing `g^beta * x`.\n\n2. ** Responder (R) **:\n   - Generates a fresh nonce `y`.\n   - Receives a message from Initiator and extracts `I`, `s`, and `alpha` (which is `g^x`).\n   - Claims the Session ID (SID) by sending `s`.\n   - Sends a message to Initiator containing `R`, `s`, `g^y`, and a signature over these values.\n   - Receives a message from Initiator, which includes a signature over `I`, `s`, `alpha`, `g^y`, and `R`.\n   - Claims the Shared Key (SKR) by computing `g^alpha * y`.\n\n**Messages:**\n\n1. **Message 1 (I -> R)**: Contains `I`, `s`, and `g^x`.\n2. **Message 2 (R -> I)**: Contains `R`, `s`, `g^y`, and a signature.\n3. **Message 3 (I -> R)**: Contains a signature.\n\n**Claims:**\n\n- ** Initiator (I) **:\n  - Claims the Session ID (SID) after sending `s`.\n  - Claims the Shared Key (SKR) after receiving the second message and computing `g^beta * x`.\n\n- ** Responder (R) **:\n  - Claims the Session ID (SID) after receiving the first message and extracting `s`.\n  - Claims the Shared Key (SKR) after receiving the third message and computing `g^alpha * y`.\n\n**Security Features:**\n\n- The protocol uses a hash function to ensure the integrity of the messages.\n- The protocol employs a helper protocol `@exponentiation` to simulate the commutative property of the group operation, allowing the calculation of `g^ab` as `g^ba`.\n\n---\n\nBased on this description, a corresponding spdl file can be created to represent the SIG-DH-UM protocol in Scyther.
