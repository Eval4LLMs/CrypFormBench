Here is the corrected portion of the code:\n\n```spthy\nrule Resp_K1_1:\n  let m1     = adec(c1, ~lkR)\n      nonceB = ~m2\n      key    = KDF(< m1, $I, $R, nonceB, c1 >)\n      tagB   = MAC(key, (< 'KC_1_V', $R, $I, nonceB, c1 >) )\n  in\n   [ Fr( ~m2 ), In( c1 ), !Ltk( $R, ~lkR ), !Pk($I,pkI) ]\n   --[  SidR ( ~m2, $R, $I, <$R, $I, 'Resp', nonceB, c1>)\n     ,  Match( ~m2, <$I, $R, 'Init', c1>)\n     ,  Match( ~m2, <$I, $R, 'Init', c1, nonceB>)\n     ]->\n   [ Out(< nonceB, tagB >), !Sessk( ~m2, key ) ]\n```\n\nI've added the `Out(< nonceB, tagB >)` action to send the response message back to the initiator. Now the code should compile correctly with the Tamarin tool.
