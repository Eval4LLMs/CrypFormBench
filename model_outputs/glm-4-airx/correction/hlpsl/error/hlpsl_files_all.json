However, based on the context of the protocol and the typical issues encountered in hlpsl files, the problem might be with the use of the variable `sec_k1` or `sec_k2` without proper initialization or scope declaration.\n\nIn hlpsl, to ensure that the variable is correctly defined and can be compiled by the avispa tool, we need to make sure that it is declared and initialized properly. Here is a corrected version of the roles `eke_Init` and `eke_Resp` with the proper declaration and initialization of the variables `sec_k1` and `sec_k2`:\n\n```hlpsl\nrole eke_Init (A,B: agent,\n               Kab: symmetric_key,\n               Snd,Rcv: channel(dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n  local State   : nat,\n        Ea      : public_key,\n        Na,Nb,K : text,\n        sec_k1  : protocol_id := new()  %% Corrected line 136\n\n  init  State := 0\n\n  transition\n    ...\n    2.

This should resolve the compilation error related to the incorrect variable definition.\n\nPlease replace the `...` with the rest of the transitions and the rest of the protocol description as they were in the original file.

Since the code provided does not show line numbers, I'll have to infer the missing part based on the protocol description and the typical structure of hlpsl code.\n\nThe likely missing part is in the `visitedGateKeeper` role, in the transition where the VGK receives a message from the AuF (line 132 in the original code). This transition should update the VGK's state and prepare the response to the MT with the necessary information to establish the shared key.\n\nBased on the protocol description and the structure of the code, the missing line should contain the assignment of the `Key` variable, which is used later in the protocol to send the response to the MT.
