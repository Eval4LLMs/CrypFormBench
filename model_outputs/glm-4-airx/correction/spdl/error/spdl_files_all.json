The `recv_2` message seems to be incomplete. The likely missing part is the actual message content that `I` should expect from `R` after sending message `1`.\n\nHere's a plausible correction for the missing part of line 94:\n\n```spdl\n  send_1( I, R, {Ni, SPIi, O, SA1, g(i)} );\n  recv_2( R, I, {SPIi, SPIr, SA1, g(r), Nr} );\n```\n\nThe corrected protocol should look like this, with the added content in bold:\n\n```spdl\n# ... [omitted lines for brevity] ...\n\nprotocol ikev2-mac(I, R)\n{\n\n role I {\n  fresh i, Ni, SPIi: Nonce;\n  var Nr, SPIr: Nonce;\n  var Gr: Ticket;\n\n\n\n  send_1( I, R, {Ni, SPIi, O, SA1, g(i)} );  # Message 1 sent by I\n  recv_2( R, I, {SPIi, SPIr, SA1, g(r), Nr} );  # Message 2 received by I, corrected line 94\n\n  claim( I, Running, R, Ni,g(i),Nr,Gr,TSi,TSr);\n  send_!3( I, R, (SPIi,SPIr), {I, R, MAC(k(I,R), SPIi, O, SA1, g(i), Ni, Nr, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr), I)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n  recv_!4( R, I, (SPIi,SPIr), {R, MAC(k(I,R), SPIi, SPIr, SA1, Gr, Nr, Ni, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr), R)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n\n  claim( I, SKR, KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n  claim( I, Alive );\n  claim( I, Weakagree );\n  claim( I, Commit, R, Ni,g(i),Nr,Gr,TSi,TSr);\n\n }\n\n role R {\n  fresh r, Nr, SPIr: Nonce;\n  var Ni, SPIi: Nonce;\n  var Gi: Ticket;\n\n\n\n  recv_1( I, R, SPIi, O, SA1, Gi, Ni );\n  send_2( R, I, (SPIi,SPIr), SA1, g(r), Nr );\n\n\n  recv_!3( I, R, (SPIi,SPIr), {I, R, MAC(k(R,I), SPIi, O, SA1, Gi, Ni, Nr, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr), I)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n  claim( R, Running, I, Ni,Gi,Nr,g(r),TSi,TSr);\n  send_!4( R, I, (SPIi,SPIr), {R, MAC(k(R,I), SPIi, SPIr, SA1, g(r), Nr, Ni, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr), R)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n\n  claim( R, SKR, KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n  claim( R, Alive );\n  claim( R, Weakagree );\n  claim( R, Commit, I, Ni,Gi,Nr,g(r),TSi,TSr);\n }\n}\n```\n\nThis correction assumes that message `1` sent by `I` contains `Ni`, `SPIi`, `O`, `SA1`, and `g(i)`, and message `2` received by `I` from `R` contains `SPIi`, `SPIr`, `SA1`, `g(r)`, and `Nr`. This is a typical message"]], "SPDL-1/isoiec-9798-2-1.spdl": [[true, "protocol isoiec-9798-2-1(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tfresh TNA: Nonce;\n\t\tfresh Text1,Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\tclaim(A,Running,B,TNA,Text1);\n\t\tsend_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\t}\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar TNA: Nonce; // Corrected line 45 by adding the missing variable declaration\n\t\tvar Text1,Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\n\t\tclaim(B,Commit,A,TNA,Text1);\n\t\tclaim(B,Alive);\n\t\tclaim(B,Weakagree);\n\t}\n}", "It appears there was a misunderstanding. You've provided a description of the protocols rather than the correction to the SPDL file. I apologize for the confusion. Let's address the missing content in line 45 of the SPDL file you mentioned.\n\nWithout the actual content of line 45, I can only speculate based on the context provided. In the `isoiec-9798-2-1` protocol, it seems that the role B is missing a variable declaration for `TNA`. Since `TNA` is mentioned in the claims made by B, it should be declared as a variable in the role B's section. Here is the corrected SPDL code for the role B in the `isoiec-9798-2-1` protocol:\n\n```spdl\nprotocol isoiec-9798-2-1(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tfresh TNA: Nonce;\n\t\tfresh Text1,Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\tclaim(A,Running,B,TNA,Text1);\n\t\tsend_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\t}\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar TNA: Nonce; // Corrected line 45 by adding the missing variable declaration\n\t\tvar Text1,Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\n\t\tclaim(B,Commit,A,TNA,Text1);\n\t\tclaim(B,Alive);\n\t\tclaim(B,Weakagree);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThe added line `var TNA: Nonce;` should be placed within the role B's variable declarations, which would typically be located at the beginning of the role's section, before any other actions or claims are made. With this correction, the SPDL file should compile properly with the Scyther tool, assuming there are no other issues with the file."]]}
