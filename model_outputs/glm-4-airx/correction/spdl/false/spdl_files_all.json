You provided a description of the protocols rather than the modifications needed to correct the false positive security issue in the SPDL file. Since I cannot directly view or edit files, I will guide you on how to modify the SPDL code to address the false positive.\n\nTo correct a false positive in an SPDL file for the Scyther tool, you need to ensure that the protocol description accurately reflects the intended behavior of the protocol without introducing any security flaws. Here are some general steps you might take to address a false positive:\n\n1. **Check for Proper Key Usage**: Ensure that the keys used for encryption and decryption are correctly specified and that the roles use the correct keys for communication.\n\n2. **Ensure Freshness**: Make sure that nonces or other fresh values are generated correctly and used appropriately to prevent replay attacks.\n\n3. **Validate Claims**: If there are claims made within the protocol (such as `Running`, `Commit`, `Alive`, `Weakagree`), ensure that they are logically connected to the rest of the protocol's behavior.\n\n4. **Correct Message Structures**: Verify that the messages sent between roles contain the correct fields and are encrypted/decrypted with the appropriate keys.\n\n5. **Simplify Protocol**: If the protocol is overly complex, simplify it to make sure Scyther can verify it without false positives.\n\nGiven the SPDL code you provided, here is an example of how you might modify the `isoiec-9798-2-1` protocol to address a potential false positive:\n\n```spdl\nprotocol isoiec-9798-2-1(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tfresh TNA: Nonce;\n\t\tfresh Text1, Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// The claim should be made after the message is sent to ensure the nonce is fresh\n\t\tsend_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\t\tclaim(A,Running,B,TNA,Text1);\n\t}\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar TNA: Nonce;\n\t\tvar Text1, Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\n\t\t// The claims should be based on the received message and the verification of the nonce\n\t\tif ( checkfresh(TNA) )\n\t\t{\n\t\t\tclaim(B,Commit,B,TNA,Text1);\n\t\t\tclaim(B,Alive);\n\t\t\tclaim(B,Weakagree);\n\t\t}\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nIn the above modification, I moved the `claim(A,Running,B,TNA,Text1);` after the message is sent to ensure that the nonce `TNA` is fresh. I also added a conditional statement to check the freshness of `TNA` before making the claims in role B.\n\nPlease note that these modifications are speculative, as the actual false positive issue in your SPDL file is not detailed. You should carefully review the protocol logic and Scyther's verification output to identify the exact point where the false positive is occurring and apply the necessary changes to resolve it."]], "SPDL-1/otwayrees.spdl": [[true, "/* \n * Otway-Rees protocol with corrected logic\n */\n\n// Protocol name declaration\nprotocol OtwayRees(I, R, S)\n{\n    // Type declarations\n    role I\n    {\n        // Variables and constants declarations\n        fresh Ni: Nonce;       // Initiator's nonce\n        fresh M: Ticket;       // Message identifier\n        var Nr: Nonce;         // Responder's nonce\n        var Kir: SessionKey;   // Session key\n\n        // Secret keys shared between parties and server\n        const Kis: SessionKey; // Key shared between I and S\n\n        // Protocol steps from the Initiator's perspective\n        send_1(I, R, M, {M, I, R, Ni}Kis);\n        recv_4(R, I, M, {Ni, Kir}Kis);\n\n        // Security claims\n        claim_I1(I, Secret, Kir);\n        claim_I2(I, Nisynch);\n        claim_I3(I, Niagree);\n    }\n\n    role R\n    {\n        // Variables and constants declarations\n        var Ni: Nonce;         // Initiator's nonce\n        fresh Nr: Nonce;       // Responder's nonce\n        var Kir: SessionKey;   // Session key\n\n        // Secret keys shared between parties and server\n        const Krs: SessionKey; // Key shared between R and S\n\n        // Protocol steps from the Responder's perspective\n        recv_1(I, R, M, {M, I, R, Ni}Kis);\n        send_2(R, S, M, {M, I, R, Ni}Kis, {M, I, R, Nr}Krs);\n        recv_3(S, R, M, {Nr, Kir}Krs, {Ni, Kir}Kis);\n        send_4(R, I, M, {Ni, Kir}Kis);\n\n        // Security claims\n        claim_R1(R, Secret, Kir);\n        claim_R2(R, Nisynch);\n        claim_R3(R, Niagree);\n    }\n\n    role S\n    {\n        // Variables and constants declarations\n        var Ni, Nr: Nonce;     // Nonces from I and R\n        fresh Kir: SessionKey; // Session key generated by the server\n\n        // Secret keys shared between parties and server\n        const Kis: SessionKey; // Key shared between I and S\n        const Krs: SessionKey; // Key shared between R and S\n\n        // Protocol steps from the Server's perspective\n        recv_2(R, S, M, {M, I, R, Ni}Kis, {M, I, R, Nr}Krs);\n        send_3(S, R, M, {Nr, Kir}Krs, {Ni, Kir}Kis);\n    }\n}", "Based on the logic description provided, there are a few issues in the given SPDL code that could lead to a false negative in the verification results.

This change is crucial for the protocol to work as intended, ensuring that the Responder (R) knows which Initiator (I) is attempting to communicate with it.\n\nThis corrected SPDL code should now be able to run with the Sc"]], "SPDL-1/protocol1.spdl": [[true, "/* \n * Protocol: protocol1\n * A symmetric key exchange protocol with nonce-based authentication\n * between an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R)\n */\n\n// Protocol identification\nprotocol protocol1(I, R)\n{\n    // Role declarations\n    role I\n    {\n        // Variable declarations\n        fresh ni: Nonce;    // Fresh nonce generated by I\n        var nr: Nonce;      // Nonce received from R\n\n        // Message sequence\n        send_1(I, R, {I, ni}pk(R));\n        recv_2(R, I, {R, ni, nr}pk(I));\n        send_3(I, R, {nr}pk(R));\n\n        // Security claims by Initiator\n        claim_i1(I, Secret, ni);  // Claim secrecy of ni\n        // Removed claim_i2 as it is incorrect\n        claim_i3(I, Nisynch);     // Claim non-injective synchronization\n    }\n\n    role R\n    {\n        // Variable declarations\n        var ni: Nonce;      // Nonce received from I\n        fresh nr: Nonce;    // Fresh nonce generated by R\n\n        // Message sequence\n        recv_1(I, R, {I, ni}pk(R));\n        send_2(R, I, {R, ni, nr}pk(I));\n        recv_3(I, R, {nr}pk(R));\n\n        // Security claims by Responder\n        // Removed claim_r1 as it is incorrect\n        claim_r2(R, Secret, nr);  // Claim secrecy of nr\n        claim_r3(R, Nisynch);     // Claim non-injective synchronization\n    }\n}\n\n// Default intruder knowledge\nusertype Nonce;\nconst pk: Function;", "Based on the provided logic description, there seems to be an issue with the security claims made by both the Initiator and the Responder.

The protocol does not provide a mechanism for either party to learn the other party's nonce as a secret.\n\nHere's the modified SPDL code with the corrected security claims:\n\n```spdl\n/* \n * Protocol: protocol1\n * A symmetric key exchange protocol with nonce-based authentication\n * between an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R)\n */\n\n// Protocol identification\nprotocol protocol1(I, R)\n{\n    // Role declarations\n    role I\n    {\n        // Variable declarations\n        fresh ni: Nonce;    // Fresh nonce generated by I\n        var nr: Nonce;      // Nonce received from R\n\n        // Message sequence\n        send_1(I, R, {I, ni}pk(R));\n        recv_2(R, I, {R, ni, nr}pk(I));\n        send_3(I, R, {nr}pk(R));\n\n        // Security claims by Initiator\n        claim_i1(I, Secret, ni);  // Claim secrecy of ni\n        // Removed claim_i2 as it is incorrect\n        claim_i3(I, Nisynch);     // Claim non-injective synchronization\n    }\n\n    role R\n    {\n        // Variable declarations\n        var ni: Nonce;      // Nonce received from I\n        fresh nr: Nonce;    // Fresh nonce generated by R\n\n        // Message sequence\n        recv_1(I, R, {I, ni}pk(R));\n        send_2(R, I, {R, ni, nr}pk(I));\n        recv_3(I, R, {nr}pk(R));\n\n        // Security claims by Responder\n        // Removed claim_r1 as it is incorrect\n        claim_r2(R, Secret, nr);  // Claim secrecy of nr\n        claim_r3(R, Nisynch);     // Claim non-injective synchronization\n    }\n}\n\n// Default intruder knowledge\nusertype Nonce;\nconst pk: Function;\n```\n\nIn this modified version, the claims `claim_i2(I, Secret, nr)` and `claim_r1(R, Secret, ni)` have been removed, as they are not valid claims based on the protocol description. Each party should only claim the secrecy of their own nonce. Additionally, the claims of non-injective synchronization (`claim_i3(I, Nisynch)` and `claim_r3(R, Nisynch)`) might need to be revisited as well, depending on the exact definition of \"non-injective synchronization\" in the context of this protocol and the SPDL language.

Without specific details on the nature of the false positive, I'll make a general assumption that the issue might be related to the encryption and decryption process, which is often a source of false positives in formal verification.\n\nHere's the modified SPDL code for the `@keysymm-21` protocol:\n\n```spdl\n/*\n * Modified SPDL file for the @keysymm-21 protocol to resolve false positive.\n */\nprotocol @keysymm-21(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tvar T: Nonce;\n\t\tvar Text: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// A receives a message supposedly from B, containing a nonce T, A's identity, and some text, all encrypted with their shared key\n\t\trecv_!1(B,A, { T, A, Text }k(A,B) );\n\t\t\n\t\t// Decrypt the received message to verify the sender and the integrity of the message\n\t\t// Assuming the decryption is successful and no false positives should arise from this step\n\t\tT := decrypt({ T, A, Text }k(A,B));\n\t\t\n\t\t// A responds by sending a similar message to B, but with the key k(B,A) which is equivalent to k(A,B) due to symmetry\n\t\tsend_!2(A,B, { T, A, Text }k(B,A) );\n\t\t\n\t\t// Claim that A is running the protocol with B, using nonce T and text Text\n\t\tclaim(A,Running,B,T,Text);\n\t}\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar T: Nonce;\n\t\tvar Text: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// B receives a message supposedly from A, containing a nonce T, B's identity, and some text, all encrypted with their shared key\n\t\trecv_!3(A,B, { T, B, Text }k(A,B) );\n\t\t\n\t\t// Decrypt the received message to verify the sender and the integrity of the message\n\t\t// Assuming the decryption is successful and no false positives should arise from this step\n\t\tT := decrypt({ T, B, Text }k(A,B));\n\t\t\n\t\t// B responds by sending a similar message to A\n\t\tsend_!4(B,A, { T, B, Text }k(B,A) );\n\t\t\n\t\t// B claims it has committed to the protocol run with A, using nonce T and text Text\n\t\tclaim(B,Commit,A,T,Text);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nAnd here's the modified SPDL code for the `isoiec-9798-2-1` protocol:\n\n```spdl\n/*\n * Modified SPDL file for the isoiec-9798-2-1 protocol to resolve false positive.\n */\nprotocol isoiec-9798-2-1(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tfresh TNA: Nonce;\n\t\tfresh Text1,Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// A claims it is running the protocol with B, using nonce TNA and text Text1\n\t\tclaim(A,Running,B,TNA,Text1);\n\t\t\n\t\t// A sends a message to B containing some text and an encrypted part with a fresh nonce TNA, B's identity, and some text, all encrypted with their shared key\n\t\tsend_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\t\t\n\t\t// Decrypt the message part to verify the sender and the integrity of the message\n\t\t// Assuming the decryption is successful and no false positives should arise from this step\n\t\tTNA := decrypt({ TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B));\n\t\t\n\t\t// Additional claim for A's perspective on the protocol run\n\t\tclaim(A,Secret,TNA);\n\t}\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar TNA: Nonce;\n\t\tvar Text1,Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// B receives the message from A\n\t\trecv_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\n\t\t// Decrypt the message part to verify the sender and the integrity of the message\n\t\t// Assuming the decryption is successful and no false positives should arise from this step\n\t\tTNA := decrypt({ TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B));\n\t\t\n\t\t// B claims it has committed to the protocol run with A, using nonce TNA and text Text1\n\t\tclaim(B,Commit,A,TNA,Text1);\n\t\t\n\t\t// B claims it is alive, indicating it has received a message and responded appropriately\n\t\tclaim(B,Alive);"]]}
