This part involves the serialization and encryption of the ephemeral public key before sending it over the channel. \n\nThe corrected portion of the code should include the serialization of the ephemeral public key and its encryption before sending it to the other party. The corrected code snippet is as follows:\n\n```pv\nout(c, crypto_box(serialize_pk(ephpub),n,theirkey,mykey));\n```\n\nHowever, this line is already present in the original code but commented out. Since we need to correct the code without adding new features or changing the logic significantly, we should uncomment this line and ensure that the `serialize_pk` function is properly defined.\n\nHere is the corrected code snippet with the relevant part uncommented and assuming that the `serialize_pk` function is already defined as per the comments in the code:\n\n```pv\nlet clientA(mykey:sk,theirkey:pk,mysecret:bitstring) =\n new ephsec:sk;\n let ephpub = crypto_box_keypair(ephsec) in\n\n let n = n0 in\n out(c, n);\n \n out(c, crypto_box(serialize_pk(ephpub),n,theirkey,mykey));  (* Line 71 corrected *)\n in(c, enc:bitstring);\n let serialize_pk(theireph) = crypto_box_open(enc,n,theirkey,mykey) in\n out(c, crypto_box(mysecret,n,theireph,ephsec));\n in(c, enc2:bitstring);\n let theirsecret = crypto_box_open(enc2,n,theireph,ephsec) in\n \n out(c, mykey).\n```\n\nPlease note that the `serialize_pk` function should convert the public key into a bitstring format that can be encrypted and sent over the channel. The actual implementation of `serialize_pk` is not provided here, as it was not part of the original code snippet. You would need to ensure that this function is correctly implemented in your pv file.\n\nThe corrected pv file should now compile with ProVerif, assuming there are no other errors in the code.

Host B is supposed to decrypt the message with its shared password, but it is using a symmetric key `sEA` which should be generated by Host A, not known by Host B. Additionally, the variable `R` is not defined before it's used to encrypt the response.

This is a placeholder for the actual decryption logic which would depend on how `EA` is encrypted in the first place.\n- `R` is a symmetric key that should be generated by Host B. The actual logic for generating `R` is not provided, so it is represented as a new key here.\n- The decryption of `m3` and the encryption of `(challengeA, challengeB)` assume that `sdec` and `senc` are defined correctly in the protocol.\n\nWith these corrections, the code should be more logically consistent and should compile with Proverif.

The corrected code should properly decrypt the message received in step 2 and extract the nonces Na and Ni, as well as the identifier I. Here's the corrected portion of the code:\n\n```pv\nlet client_A(skA : bitstring, pkS : bitstring) =\n  new Na : bitstring;\n\n  (* get pub key of I *)\n  out(c, (A, I));\n  in(c, sign_I_pkI : bitstring);\n  let (=I, pkI : bitstring) = checksign(sign_I_pkI, pkS) in\n\n  out(c, aenc((Na, A), pkI));                                (* 1. *)\n  in(c, aenc_Na_Ni_I : bitstring);                           (* 2. *)\n  let (=Na, Ni : bitstring, =I) = adec(aenc_Na_Ni_I, skA) in   (* Corrected line 84 *)\n  out(c, aenc(Ni, pkI)).

This assumes that the `aenc` function encrypts a tuple of nonces and an identifier, and the `adec` function is the corresponding decryption function that correctly handles this tuple.\n\nThe rest of the code should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the protocol description provided.

The `Type` issue likely stems from the use of a type that hasn't been declared or defined in the context where it's used. In the provided code snippet, there isn't an explicit line 101, but I will infer from the context that the issue might be with the use of types like `bitstring`, `tag`, `ec_point`, `ec_scalar`, and `eddsa_signature` without proper type definitions or conversions.\n\nThe first step is to define these types if they are not already defined. However, from the context of the code, it seems that these types are meant to be present, but the actual type definitions or conversions might be missing, especially for `bitstring` and `tag`. In Proverif, `bitstring` is a predefined type, but `tag` is not. We need to define `tag` as an alias for `bitstring` if we want to use it in that way.\n\nLet's correct the code assuming `tag` is meant to be an alias for `bitstring`.

The session keys `k[x,Na,A[],Nb,B[]]` are computed using a function `k` that takes as input the identifiers and nonces of both parties, which is a typical way to establish a session key in the Otway-Rees protocol.\n\nPlease note that this correction assumes that the function `k` is properly defined elsewhere in the horn file and that it generates a unique session key for each pair of nonces and identifiers. If the function `k` is not defined, it would need to be added to the horn file as well.\n\nAfter making this correction, the horn file should compile with ProVerif, and you should be able to obtain the verification results."]], "PV-1/piskeme.pi": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The corrected code now includes `pkB` as the second argument to the `decrypt` function to properly decrypt the message `m1` that was encrypted with `pkB`. This change should allow the Proverif tool to compile and run the pi file."]]}
