It includes the processes for the Credential Generator, User, Gateway Node, and Sensor. Each process has its state variables and transitions based on receiving or sending messages. In reality, you would need to define the cryptographic functions (`encrypt`), the format of the messages, and the specific conditions for state transitions based on the protocol's logic.\n\nRemember to replace the placeholders (like `password'`, `uid'`, `ts1'`, etc.) with actual logic that reflects the initialization and computation of values as per the protocol's description. Also, the communication between processes should reflect the actual message exchanges in the protocol.\n\nTo compile this code with AVISPA, save it to a file with an appropriate filename (e.g., `protocol.hlpsl`) and use the AVISPA toolchain to analyze it.
