You would also need to handle the actual message types (`KEXDHINIT`, `KEXDHREPLY`) and their contents properly, including the verification of signatures and the exchange of secure messages. Additionally, you would need to define the `leak` function to specify what constitutes a leak of `secretC`.\n\nTo compile and run this code with Proverif, you would save it to a file with a `.pv` extension and then run Proverif on the command line with the file as input.

Below is an example of how this might look between the ```pv and ``` markers. Note that this example assumes a simple encryption and decryption mechanism and does not represent any specific real-world cryptographic functions.\n\n```pv\n```\n% Define the type of the public and secret keys\ntype key.\n\n% Define the type of the votes\ntype vote = bitstring.\n\n% Define the type of messages\ntype message = < vote, key, key >.\n\n% Define the participants\nicipant Voter: \n  % The voter has a secret key and can encrypt votes\n  in sk : key, \n  in v : vote,\n  out pk : key,\n  out m : message.\n\nicipant Channel:\n  % The channel can send messages\n  out m : message.\n\n% Define the public key generation function\nfun pubkey(key: key): key.\n\n% Define the encryption function\nfun encrypt(vote: vote, key: key): bitstring.\n\n% Define the decryption function\nfun decrypt(bitstring: bitstring, key: key): vote.\n\n% Protocol description\nVoter:\n  sk = fresh key. % The voter generates a fresh secret key\n  pk = pubkey(sk). % The voter computes the public key\n  send Channel < pk >. % The voter sends the public key to the channel\n\n  if (True) {\n    m = < v, encrypt(v, pk), pk >. % The voter encrypts the vote and sends it\n    send Channel m.\n  } else {\n    m = < v, encrypt(v, pk), pubkey(fresh key) >. % The voter can choose to send a different public key\n    send Channel m.\n  }\n\n% Security properties and reductions can be defined below\n% ...\n\n% End of protocol description\n```\n\nPlease note the following points about the code:\n\n1. This is a simplified model of a voting protocol. In a real-world scenario, the encryption and decryption functions would be more complex and would need to be defined in detail.\n2. The `fresh key` statement is used to generate a new key that has not appeared before in the protocol execution.\n3. The `if (True)` statement is a placeholder. In a real protocol, you would have conditions that determine the behavior of the protocol.\n4. The `send` statement models sending a message from one participant to another.\n5. The actual Proverif code may need to include additional details such as the reduction relations for the encryption and decryption functions, and security properties to be checked.\n\nBefore running this code in Proverif, you would need to define the actual cryptographic primitives and the properties you want to verify. The code above is a starting point and would need to be adapted to the specifics of the protocol you are analyzing."]]}
