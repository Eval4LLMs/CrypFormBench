The protocol utilizes public/private key cryptography, hash functions, and a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) to ensure the confidentiality and authenticity of the exchanged messages.\n\n### Description of the Protocol\n\n1. **Participants**:\n   - **OBU1 and OBU2**: These represent two on-board units (vehicles or devices) that are engaging in a secure communication.\n   - **SN (Security Node)**: This acts as a mediator or authority that assists in securely exchanging messages between OBU1 and OBU2.\n\n2. **Parameters**:\n   - **PID1, PID2**: Identification texts for OBU1 and OBU2.\n   - **C1, C2**: Contextual texts utilized during interaction.\n   - **P**: A public parameter used in cryptographic operations.\n   - **H**: A hash function used to ensure data integrity.\n   - **PUF1, PUF2**: Physical Unclonable Functions for OBU1 and OBU2, respectively.\n\n3. **Roles**:\n   - **Role_OU1**:\n     - State transitions start at `State = 0`, waiting for a \"start\" message.\n     - It generates a nonce (`A1`), derives a session key and a MAC (Message Authentication Code), and sends it to OBU2.\n  \n   - **Role_OBU2**:\n     - Initiates with `State = 0`, listening for messages from OBU1.\n     - Upon receiving OBU1's message, it computes its own nonce and responds with a \"C1\" and the derived MAC.\n\n   - **Role_SN**:\n     - Starts in `State = 1`, listening for messages that initiate the session.\n     - The role handles the interaction by verifying the messages and computing the necessary PUF-based nonces, responding with appropriate session keys.\n\n4. **Transitions**:\n   - All roles contain state-based transitions ensuring strict protocol following.\n   - The protocol ensures that messages received meet correct criteria using hashed values and PUF computations, promoting security against replay attacks.\n\n5. **Confidentiality / Secrecy**:\n   - The protocol maintains secrecy for several messages including nonces (`r1`, `r2`) and other derived secrets (`a1`, `a2`), ensuring that these remain unknown to unauthorized entities.\n\n6. **Authentication**:\n   - Verifying that the message from OBU1 to OBU2 is authentic and vice versa, using hashed values for guarantees.\n   - Authentication mechanisms are confirmed through witness registrations and requests logged in each role.\n\n7. **Environment**:\n   - The environment is defined with constants setting up a secure initial state and the roles can interact only through defined channels, restricting any unauthorized access or eavesdropping.\n\n8. **Goals**:\n   - The ultimate goal established in the protocol is to ensure the secrecy of the previously defined secrets and to authenticate the identities of the communicating participants.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis protocol serves to establish a secure communication channel between two OBUs with the assistance of a SN, ensuring both message confidentiality and participant authentication, thus enhancing the overall integrity and trustworthiness of vehicular communication systems.

This should maintain clarity while ensuring the original functionality is preserved for processing by the Avispa tool."]], "logic": [[true, "The provided HLPSL file specifies a protocol for Transport Layer Security (TLS), focusing on the two parties involved (Alice and Bob) and their interactions, as well as the environment and security goals. Below is a detailed description of the protocol based on the HLPSL content that could be used to generate a corresponding HLPSL file for AVISPA.\n\n### Description of the TLS Protocol\n\n#### Overview\nThe Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol is designed to provide a secure communication channel over a computer network. It achieves confidentiality, data integrity, and authentication between the communicating parties. This specification outlines the key roles involved (Alice as the client and Bob as the server), the transitions between different states during communication, and the security goals to be achieved.\n\n#### Roles\n1. **Alice (Client)**: Alice initiates the connection to Bob, requesting a secure session. Alice generates a session ID, a nonce (Na), and an ephemeral key (Pa) to start the handshake.\n   \n2. **Bob (Server)**: Bob responds to Alice's request. He generates his nonce (Nb), and sends a message containing Alice's nonce, session ID, and public key (Kb) after decrypting Alice's message.\n\n3. **Session Role**: This role encompasses both Alice and Bob, managing their interactions during the session establishment process.\n\n4. **Environment Role**: This role includes all agents involved in the protocol (Alice, Bob, and an intruder agent). It defines the setup for test scenarios, including the knowledge of the intruder and possible simultaneous sessions.\n\n#### Communication Flow\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Alice starts the session by sending her nonce, session ID, and ephemeral public key to Bob over the channel.\n\n2. **Response from Bob**:\n   - Bob receives Alice's message and prepares his nonce and sends a response back to Alice, which includes Alice's public key, a session confirmation, and a key that is supposed to be shared for session continuity.\n\n3. **Key Generation**:\n   - Upon successfully receiving messages, both parties derive a session key using the hash function, nonces, and their respective public keys.\n\n4. **Finalization**:\n   - Alice validates the communication by expecting a finished message from Bob, and once received, confirms the session connection. Both parties also compute and store their session keys.\n\n#### Security Goals\n- **Secrecy**: Guarantee the confidentiality of the session keys generated for both Alice (Client) and Bob (Server). \n- **Authentication**: Ensure that the identities of Alice and Bob are correctly verified at different stages (using the nonce identifiers `na_nb1` and `na_nb2`).\n\n### AVISPA Modifications\nThe description provided outlines the interactions and goals of the TLS protocol for safe execution in an HLPSL format, which is vital for utilizing the AVISPA tool for formal verification. The formal definitions, transitions, and roles help ensure the protocol's integrity, confidentiality, and authentication requirements are met in a computational model.\n\nThis description can be translated back to HLPSL syntax as necessary to fulfill specific security analysis or simulation needs within AVISPA framework, ensuring that both practical and theoretical security dimensions of the TLS protocol are rigorously evaluated.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe TLS protocol specification captures a comprehensive interaction model between the client and server, detailing the necessary conditions for establishing secure communications. Through the defined roles, state transitions, and security objectives, this model is suited for formal analysis to confirm its resilience against potential security threats."]]}, "HLPSL-1/DH.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "role role_A(A:agent,B:agent,G:text,SND,RCV:channel(dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n\tlocal\n\t\tState:nat,  // Current state of role A\n\t\tY:text,     // Received value from role B\n\t\tX:text,     // Value generated by role A\n\t\tN:text      // Nonce generated by role A\n\tinit\n\t\tState := 0  // Initial state\n\ttransition\n\t\t1.

At this point, it generates a fresh value `N`, shares it as a secret (`N'`), and sends `{N'}_exp(exp(G, X), Y')` to Agent B, effectively establishing a shared secret.\n\n2. **Role B** (Agent B):\n   - **Purpose**: Responds to communication initiated by Agent A.\n   - **Initial State**: \n     - Starts in state 0.\n     - Waits for the message from Agent A containing `exp(G, X')`.\n   - **Transition**:\n     - Upon receiving `exp(G, X')`, it transitions to state 1, generates a fresh value `Y`, and sends `exp(G, Y')` back to Agent A.\n     - Waits for a message containing `{N'}_exp(exp(G, X), Y)` from Agent A, transitioning to state 2. It captures the value `N'` as a secret linked to `sec_1`.\n\n3. **Session Role** (session1):\n   - **Purpose**: Combines the roles of Agent A and Agent B.\n   - **Composition**: \n     - The session defines communication channels and facilitates the interaction between the two agents by instantiating both roles.\n\n4. **Environment Role**:\n   - **Purpose**: Models the context in which the protocol operates.\n   - **Knowledge**:\n     - The environment has knowledge of agents `a` and `b`, a text `f`, and protocol identifiers `sec_1` and `sec_2`.\n   - **Composition**:\n     - The environment runs the `session1` with agents `a` and `b` and a common text `f`.\n\n**Goals**:\n- The protocol aims to ensure the secrecy of `sec_1` during its execution. The secrecy implies that even if an intruder is aware of the channel communications, they cannot infer the secret without possessing the appropriate keys or information.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive overview of the protocol, emphasizing the structure, roles, communication mechanics, and the security objectives pursued within the context of two communicating agents.

This description includes information about the roles, the flow of messages, the purpose of the protocol, and the security goal.\n\n---\n\n## Protocol Description: CALP (Control Access Loria Protocol)\n\n### Purpose\nThe CALP protocol is designed to manage access control for a secure environment involving a server (denoted as S) and a badge reader (denoted as B). It addresses scenarios where a badge reader requests access for an employee. The protocol supports two types of access requests:\n1. **Normal Access Request** - Standard access request from the badge reader.\n2. **Exceptional Access Request** - This is not explicitly detailed in the HLPSL, but typically refers to requests which may have additional conditions.\n\n### Participants\n1. **Badge Reader (B)**: An agent responsible for submitting access requests for employees.\n2. **Server (S)**: An agent that validates the access requests coming from badge readers.\n\n### Role Definitions\n\n#### Badge Reader Role\nThe `badgeuse` role (badge reader) is defined with the following behavior:\n- It begins in an initial state (State=0).\n- Upon receiving a start signal, it transitions to State=1 and sends a message containing the employee ID and badge ID encrypted with S's public key (PKs). This message also includes a secret about the employee, ensuring that only authorized parties understand the employee identity.\n- The badge reader then waits for an acknowledgment message `{ok}_PKb` from the server, after which it transitions to State=2 and sends an acknowledgment back to the server, completing the access request cycle.\n\n#### Server Role\nThe `serveur` role (server) has a simpler definition:\n- It starts in State=0 and transitions to State=1 upon receiving a message from the badge reader containing the employee and badge information encrypted with its public key (PKs).\n- After validating this information, it responds with an acknowledgment `{ok}_PKb`.\n\n### Session Definition\nThe `session` role encapsulates the interaction between the badge reader and the server, establishing the channels used for communication between the two roles.\n\n### Environment Role\nThe `environment` role establishes the scenario in which the protocol operates:\n- It specifies the agents involved (badge reader `b`, server `s`, and potentially an intruder `i`).\n- It holds the public keys for both the server (PKb) and badge reader (PKs), alongside the IDs pertinent to employees and badges.\n- The intruder's knowledge is defined as including the public keys and identity, allowing simulations of potential attacks or interceptions of messages.\n\n### Security Goal\nThe protocol aims to ensure the **secrecy** of the employee ID (`idemploye`). This means that even if an intruder tries to intercept the communication, they should not learn the actual employee ID being used in the protocol.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe CALP protocol is structured to provide secure access control by encrypting sensitive information and ensuring that both the badge reader and the server validate each other through a series of well-defined interactions. The defined roles, session management, and environment encapsulate the necessary components to simulate and analyze the protocol's behavior and security properties using the AVISPA tool.\n\n---\n\nThis description adheres to the details provided in the HLPSL file, giving a thorough overview of the protocol's purpose, functionality, participants, and security considerations."]]}, "HLPSL-1/EKE.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: EKE: Encrypted Key Exchange\n%% VARIANT: basic\n%% PURPOSE: Encrypted key exchange\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\url{http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bellovin92encrypted.html}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%%   \\item Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n%%   \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%% A -> B : {Ea}_Kab        |    Key exchange part\n%% B -> A : {{K}_Ea}_Kab    |\n%% A -> B : {Ca}_K          |\n%% B -> A : {Ca,Cb}_K       |    Challenge/Response\n%% A -> B : {Cb}_K          |    Authentication part\n%% \\end{verbatim}\n%%\n%% LIMITATIONS: None\n%%\n%% PROBLEMS: 3\n%%\n%% CLASSIFICATION: G2 G12\n%%\n%% ATTACKS: \n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%% i -> (a,3): start\n%% (a,3) -> i: {Ea(1)}_kab\n%% i -> (a,6): {Ea(1)}_kab\n%% (a,6) -> i: {{K(2)}_Ea(1)}_kab \n%% i -> (a,3): {{K(2)}_Ea(1)}_kab\n%% (a,3) -> i: {Na(3)}_K(2) witness(a,b,na,Na(3))\n%% i -> (a,6): {Na(3)}_K(2)\n%% (a,6) -> i: {Na(3),Nb(4)}_K(2) witness(a,b,nb,Nb(4))\n%% i -> (a,3): {Na(3),Nb(4)}_K(2)\n%% (a,3) -> i: {Nb(4)}_K(2)  request(a,b,nb,Nb(4))\n%% \\end{verbatim}\n%%\n%% Parallel session attack, man-in-the-middle\n%% between A as initiator and A as responder, attacker\n%% masquerades as B, but no secret nonces are exposed.\n%%\n%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%HLPSL:\n\nrole eke_Init (A,B: agent,\n               Kab: symmetric_key,\n               Snd,Rcv: channel(dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n\n  local State   : nat,         // Current state of the protocol\n        Ea      : public_key,  // A's public key\n        Na,Nb,K : text          // Nonces and shared keys\n\n  const sec_k1 : protocol_id  // Secret key for A\n\n  init  State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n   1.

It enables the secure establishment of a shared symmetric key and mutual authentication between the parties.\n\n**Reference:**  \nThe protocol is discussed in the work by Bellovin and Schneider, outlined in the paper available at: [Encrypted Key Exchange](http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bellovin92encrypted.html).\n\n**Modelers:**  \n- Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003  \n- Sebastian M\u00f6dersheim, ETH Z\u00fcrich, December 2003  \n\n#### Protocol Steps:\n\n1. **Key Exchange Initialization:**\n   - Alice (A) generates a public key (Ea) and sends it to Bob (B) encrypted with the symmetric key (Kab).\n   \n2. **Key Establishment:**\n   - Bob receives the public key (Ea) from Alice, generates a new symmetric key (K'), and sends it back to Alice, encrypted with the public key (Ea).\n   - Alice receives the encrypted symmetric key (K') and generates a nonce (Na) to send back to Bob, encrypted with the symmetric key (K').\n   \n3. **Challenge/Response Phase:**\n   - Bob receives Alice's nonce and responds by sending a pair of nonces (Na, Nb'), also encrypted with the symmetric key (K).\n   - Alice then responds with Bob's nonce (Nb') encrypted with the symmetric key (K).\n\n#### Limitations: \nNone noted.\n\n#### Problems Detected: \nThe protocol has been identified to have certain vulnerabilities. \n\n#### Classification: \nThe protocol falls under classifications G2 and G12 for authentication and secrecy respectively.\n\n#### Attacks: \nThe protocol is susceptible to:\n- **Parallel Session Attack:** An attacker may intercept and use previous session keys in an active attack, masquerading as one of the parties during communication.\n\n#### Security Goals:\n- **Confidentiality (G12):** The shared secret keys (sec_k1 and sec_k2) must remain confidential, i.e., they should not be disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\n  \n- **Authentication (G2):** \n   - The protocol must ensure that Alice can authenticate Bob during their communication concerning the nonce Nb.\n   - Conversely, Bob must also authenticate Alice concerning the nonce Na.\n\nIn summary, the EKE protocol provides a mechanism for secure key exchange with mutual authentication between two parties via the generation and exchange of encrypted keys and nonces. \n\n--- \n\nThis description outlines the key components and functionality of the EKE protocol, providing the necessary context to generate a corresponding HLPSL file that can be executed using the AVISPA tool."]]}, "HLPSL-1/h.530.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: H.530: Symmetric security procedures for H.323 mobility in H.510\n%% VARIANT: Original version\n%% PURPOSE: Establish an authenticated (Diffie-Hellman) shared-key\n%% between a mobile terminal (MT) and a visited gate-keeper (VGK), who do not\n%% know each other in advance, but who have a \"mutual friend\", an \n%% authentication facility (AuF) in the home domain of MT. \n%%\n%% REFERENCE: \\url{http://www.itu.int/rec/recommendation.asp?type=folders&lang=e&parent=T-REC-H.530} \\\\\n%% (original version without \"corrigendum\")\n%% MODELER: Sebastian M\\\"odersheim, ETH Z\\\"urich, 2004\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%%  Macros\n%%  M1 = MT,VGK,NIL,CH1,exp(G,X)\n%%  M2 = M1,F(ZZ,M1),VGK,exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y)\n%%  M3 = VGK,MT,F(ZZ,VGK),F(ZZ,exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y))\n%%  M4 = VGK,MT,CH1,CH2,exp(G,Y),F(ZZ,exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y)),F(ZZ,VGK)\n%%  M5 = MT,VGK,CH2,CH3\n%%  M6 = VGK,MT,CH3,CH4\n%%-------------------------------------------------------------------\n%%  1.

Here's a detailed description of the protocol tailored for generating a corresponding HLPSL file:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: H.530 - Symmetric Security Procedures for H.323 Mobility in H.510\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe H.530 protocol is designed to establish a shared key between a mobile terminal (MT) and a visited gatekeeper (VGK) in a manner that ensures mutual authentication without prior knowledge of each other. The communication is facilitated by a trusted intermediary acting as an authentication facility (AuF) located in the MT's home domain.\n\n**Roles:**\n1. **Mobile Terminal (MT):** The device that initiates the communication and seeks to authenticate itself to the VGK and establish a shared key.\n2. **Visited Gatekeeper (VGK):** The gatekeeper in the area where the MT is attempting to connect, responsible for managing the session and facilitating the key exchange.\n3. **Authentication Facility (AuF):** A trusted third party that assists in authenticating the MT to the VGK.\n\n**Communication Steps:**\n1. **Step 1:** The MT initiates the communication by sending a message containing its identity and a nonce to the VGK, along with a function based on the symmetric key shared with AuF.\n2. **Step 2:** The VGK forwards the received message to the AuF, which verifies the authenticity of the MT and prepares a response.\n3. **Step 3:** The AuF sends a signed response back to the VGK, indicating successful authentication of the MT.\n4. **Step 4:** The VGK uses the information from the AuF's response to calculate a session key, then sends it back to the MT, along with a hash of the data exchanged.\n5. **Step 5:** The MT confirms receipt of the VGK's message, sending back a verification of the shared key.\n6. **Step 6:** The VGK responds with a final confirmation of the session establishment.\n\n**Strategies for Security and Authentication:**\n- The protocol uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange principles to create a shared key (Key) between MT and VGK.\n- Hash functions are utilized to ensure the integrity and authenticity of messages exchanged during the key establishment process.\n  \n**Attack Vectors:**\n- The protocol is susceptible to replay attacks due to the lack of sufficient contextual information in the AuF's response to the VGK.\n- There have been identified vulnerabilities that stem from indistinguishability of certain messages received by the VGK.\n  \n**Environment Configuration:**\n- An environment is established where multiple sessions can be analyzed, including scenarios involving an intruder who may attempt to play back messages captured from legitimate interactions.\n\n**Goals:**\n- The key goals of the protocol include entity authentication, message authentication, replay protection, and ensuring secrecy of the established keys (sec_m_Key and sec_v_Key).\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a complete overview of the H.530 protocol, highlighting its purpose, roles, communication steps, security measures, potential attack scenarios, and overall objectives.

IKEv2 aims to perform mutual authentication and key exchange between two parties before initiating an IPsec tunnel. The variant discussed here, referred to as IKEv2-DS, utilizes digital signatures for authentication.\n\n#### Purpose\nIKEv2 is designed to facilitate the establishment of a secure communication channel by exchanging keys and authenticating the parties involved. In this specific variant (IKEv2-DS), the authentication is achieved through digital signatures.\n\n#### References\nThis protocol model adheres to the specifications outlined in the IKEv2 literature, notably referenced as `\\cite{ipsec-ikev2}`.\n\n#### Modeling Contributors\nThis protocol was modeled by:\n- Sebastian M\u00f6dersheim, ETH Z\u00fcrich, December 2003\n- Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z\u00fcrich, December 2003\n\n#### Protocol Exchanges\nThe IKEv2-DS consists of two main exchanges:\n1. **IKE_SA_INIT**: In the first exchange, both parties (Alice and Bob) generate nonces and engage in a Diffie-Hellman key exchange. This results in the establishment of an initial security association (IKE_SA).\n   - A generates a nonce `Na` and a Diffie-Hellman half key `KEa`.\n   - B generates a nonce `Nb` and a Diffie-Hellman half key `KEb`.\n   - They exchange these values, which are critical for the subsequent authentication steps.\n\n   The exchange can be summarized as follows:\n   - 1. A \u2192 B: `SAa1`, `KEa`, `Na`\n   - 2. B \u2192 A: `SAb1`, `KEb`, `Nb`\n\n2. **IKE_SA_AUTH**: The second exchange is responsible for authenticating the previously exchanged messages and establishing a \"child security association\" (CHILD_SA) for securing the IPsec tunnel.\n   - Alice (A) sends her identity, a signed message (AUTHa), and her security association (SAa2).\n   - Bob (B) responds with his identity, a signed message (AUTHb), and his security association (SAb2).\n   \n   This exchange is as follows:\n   - 3. A \u2192 B: `{A, AUTHa, SAa2}K`, where `K = H(Na.Nb.SAa1.g^KEa^KEb)` and `AUTHa = {SAa1.g^KEa.Na.Nb}inv(Ka)`\n   - 4. B \u2192 A: `{B, AUTHb, SAb2}K`, where `AUTHb = {SAb1.g^KEb.Na.Nb}inv(Kb)`\n\n#### Limitations\nSeveral assumptions and limitations exist within the model:\n- The protocol abstracts away the negotiation of cryptographic algorithms, assuming that Alice sends only one offer that Bob must accept (goal G11).\n- Certain goals of IKEv2, such as identity hiding, are not modeled.\n- Public-key certificate exchanges are omitted from this model, despite their provision in IKEv2-DS.\n- The exchange of traffic selectors specific to IP networks is excluded as they do not fit within the abstract communication model presented.\n\n#### Security Goals and Problems\n- Security goals include ensuring secrecy and authentication of the established session keys.\n- Notable problems were identified with the protocol, allowing for a man-in-the-middle attack where an intruder could mislead one of the parties into thinking they are communicating with the authentic party.\n\n#### Attack Scenario\nAn intruder could potentially relay messages between Alice and Bob, convincing Bob that he is communicating with Alice while the actual Alice is unaware of this deception. The intruder effectively reuses messages from separate sessions, which could lead to compromised authentication. This flaw could be mitigated through the implementation of key confirmation measures.\n\n#### Classification\nThe protocol's security properties are classified under several goals, including G1, G2, G3, G7, G9, G10, and G11, indicating various security properties including secrecy and authentication.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe IKEv2-DS model offers a foundational framework for understanding mutual authentication and key exchange using digital signatures. While it abstracts certain complexities and has known vulnerabilities, it is an essential building block for secure network communications through IPsec."]]}, "HLPSL-1/NSPK_2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%Alice - Bob\n%\n%   1.

Below is a generated description of the protocol based on the HLPSL content you shared:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Protocol Name:** Alice-Bob Nonce Exchange\n\n**Participants:**\n- **Alice (A)**: Initiator of the protocol\n- **Bob (B)**: Responder in the protocol\n\n**Public Keys:**\n- **Ka**: Public key of Alice\n- **Kb**: Public key of Bob\n\n**Channels:**\n- **SND**: The channel used by the sender to transmit messages\n- **RCV**: The channel used by the receiver to receive messages\n\n**Protocol Overview:**\nThe protocol is designed for secure communications between Alice and Bob, ensuring that both parties can exchange nonces securely while preventing eavesdropping or other forms of attacks. The protocol consists of the following steps:\n\n1. **Nonce Generation by Alice:**\n   - Alice generates a new nonce `Na` and sends it to Bob with her identity, protected by Bob's public key `Kb`. \n   - This message is sent as `{Na, A}_Kb`.\n\n2. **Response from Bob:**\n   - Upon receiving Alice's message, Bob decrypts it using his private key and verifies Alice's identity. He then generates his own nonce `Nb` and sends a response back to Alice which includes both nonces.\n   - This response is sent in the form of `{Na, Nb}_Ka`, ensuring it is securely addressed to Alice using her public key.\n\n3. **Final Acknowledgment by Alice:**\n   - Alice, upon receiving Bob's message, extracts the nonce `Nb` and sends it back to Bob for final confirmation. \n   - The message is transmitted as `{Nb}_Kb`, allowing Bob to verify the receipt of his nonce.\n\n**Secret Keeping:**\n- The nonces `Na` and `Nb` are kept secret by both parties throughout the protocol. They are used to provide assurance that no third parties are able to decipher the messages exchanged, thus maintaining their confidentiality.\n\n**Environment Context:**\n- The protocol is designed to be run in a specific environment where it can be simulated with agents (both real and intruder) having access to their respective public keys. \n- An intruder is modeled in the environment to assess the security against potential threats.\n\n**Goals:**\n- The main goal of this protocol is to ensure the secrecy of the nonces `Na` and `Nb` generated during the communication process. The protocol aims to confirm that neither nonce can be intercepted or learned by any adversary.\n\n---\n\nThis description outlines the main components, goals, and steps of the protocol, encapsulating the essential functionality and security considerations.

Below is a description of the Woo-Lam protocol based on the provided HLPSL file. \n\n---\n\n### Description of the Woo-Lam Protocol\n\n**Protocol Overview:**\nThe Woo-Lam protocol is an authentication protocol designed for secure communication between two parties, Alice (A) and Bob (B), with the help of a server (S). The protocol establishes a session key (Kab) for encrypted communication. It utilizes symmetric key cryptography through keys Kas (used by Alice and the server) and Kbs (used by Bob and the server).\n\n**Roles:**\n1. **Alice (A):** \n   - Initiates the protocol and holds a symmetric key (Kas) shared with the server.\n   - Sends and receives messages to/from Bob through a designated channel (RCVA).\n   - Initiates the session by sending an initial nonce (Na) to the server and waits for responses.\n\n2. **Bob (B):**\n   - Responds to Alice's requests using a symmetric key (Kbs) shared with the server.\n   - Sends its own nonce (Nb) as part of the authentication process.\n   - Interacts with Alice and the server through a separate communication channel (RCVB).\n\n3. **Server (S):**\n   - Facilitates the communication between Alice and Bob.\n   - Using the symmetric keys, it generates a session key for them after verifying their nonce values.\n\n**Workflow:**\n- **Alice's Steps:**\n  1. Start with an initial state. Alice sends her nonce (Na) to Bob.\n  2. On receiving Bob's nonce (Nb), it sends a message containing both nonces encrypted with the key Kas.\n  3. After receiving confirmation from the server with the session key Kab, it completes the session.\n\n- **Bob's Steps:**\n  1. Begins by sending its nonce (Nb) to Alice upon receiving Alice's nonce (Na).\n  2. Receives the message containing both nonces and the necessary keys, encrypts responses, and sends them back to the server.\n  3. Upon session completion, it requests the session key Kab from the server.\n\n- **Server's Steps:**\n  1. Listens for incoming requests containing nonces from both Alice and Bob.\n  2. Validates the message and responds with the session key encrypted with both keys Kas and Kbs.\n\n**Goals:**\n- The primary goal of the Woo-Lam protocol is to ensure mutual authentication between Alice and Bob, confirming both parties are who they claim to be. The authentication is assured through the exchange of encrypted nonces and the use of a trusted server.\n\n**Intruder Model:**\n- The protocol considers potential intruder interventions, ensuring that the security measures protect against unauthorized access and eavesdropping.\n\nThis overview provides a comprehensive breakdown of the various components and operational flow of the Woo-Lam protocol.

Below is a description of the protocol that facilitates the generation of the HLPSL file.\n\n### Protocol Description: NSPKxor\n\n**Agent Definitions:**\n- **Alice (A)**: One participant in the protocol, equipped with a public/private key pair (Ka, Kb).\n- **Bob (B)**: The other participant, also with a public/private key pair (Kb, Ka).\n- **Intruder (I)**: An attacker who attempts to gain knowledge of secret information exchanged between Alice and Bob.\n\n**Initialization:**\n- Both Alice and Bob begin their sessions in an idle state (State = 0).\n- Each agent generates a non-repeating nonce:  \n  - Alice creates a nonce \\( Na \\) (a random message).\n  - Bob creates a nonce \\( Nb \\) (also a random message).\n\n**Message Flow:**\n1. **Alice to Bob**:\n   - Alice sends \\( {Na.A}_Kb \\) to Bob, where \\( Na \\) is the nonce generated by Alice, and \\( Kb \\) is Bob's public key. This message ensures Bob knows it came from Alice.\n  \n2. **Bob to Alice**:\n   - Upon receiving Alice's message, Bob decrypts it using his private key to obtain \\( Na \\). He then generates a nonce \\( Nb \\) and sends back \\( {Nb, Na \\oplus B}_Ka \\) to Alice, where \\( \\oplus \\) denotes the XOR operation and \\( Ka \\) is Alice's public key. This allows Bob to confirm who he is talking to and adds his own freshness to the communication.\n  \n3. **Alice to Bob**:\n   - Once Alice receives Bob's response, she decrypts and verifies it. She then sends back \\( {Nb}_Kb \\) to Bob, confirming receipt of Bob's nonce, further solidifying the security of the session.\n\n**Roles and State Transitions:**\n- Both Alice and Bob encapsulate their behavior via state transitions, where each state is contingent on the reception of specific messages.\n- The transitions ensure that the protocol follows a strict order and that each agent acts based on the received messages and their own state.\n\n**Security Goals:**\n- The primary security goal of the NSPKxor protocol is the secrecy of \\( secret_na \\), which is a value known only to Alice and Bob. The intruder should not be able to deduce this secret even if they observe the communication.\n\n**Environment and Composition:**\n- The environment includes a representation of the communication channels between Alice, Bob, and any potential intruder.\n- It allows simultaneous sessions, meaning an intruder could try to impersonate one of the legitimate parties (session with Alice and intruder, and a session with Alice and Bob).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe NSPKxor protocol effectively employs nonces and public key cryptography to maintain communication security between Alice and Bob, ensuring that knowledge of the secret remains confined to legitimate participants despite the presence of an intruder. \n\nUsing this description, one can construct the appropriate HLPSL file that accurately represents the protocol's functionality and security properties."]]}, "HLPSL-1/strongAuthentication_xor.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%%%% B -> A: B,s\n\nrole role_A(A:agent,B:agent,SND,RCV:channel(dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n\tlocal\n\t\tState:nat,S:text,Na:text\n\tinit\n\t\tState := 0\n\ttransition\n                                1.

The protocol employs a nonce (a unique number used once) generated by Alice and the encrypted message through the use of an XOR operation, ensuring the secrecy and authenticity of the transmitted information.\n\n#### Roles\n\n1. **Role A (Alice)**:\n   - **Initial State**: 0\n   - **Transitions**:\n     - **Transition 1**: If Alice is in State 0 and receives the message \"start\", she transitions to State 1, generates a new nonce (Na'), and sends it to Bob.\n     - **Transition 2**: When in State 1, if Alice receives a message that is the result of XOR between her nonce (Na) and a secret S (denoted as xor(Na, S')), she transitions to State 2. At this point, she verifies the authenticity of the received nonce by checking that it originated from Bob.\n\n2. **Role B (Bob)**:\n   - **Initial State**: 0\n   - **Transitions**:\n     - **Transition 1**: If Bob is in State 0 and receives the nonce (Na' from Alice), he transitions to State 1. He then responds by sending back the result of XOR between the received nonce (Na') and the secret S.\n     - Bob also maintains a secret knowledge of a protocol identifier (sec_1) for the parties A and B. After responding, he verifies the authenticity of the nonce sent by Alice, ensuring that it has been sent by her.\n\n#### Session Definition\n- The session consists of both roles (Role A and Role B) being instantiated, providing a framework for mutual authentication.\n  \n#### Environment\n- The environment sets up the scenario in which Alice and Bob are engaged in two sessions simultaneously, allowing the possibility to analyze the protocol against replay attacks by manipulating the session messages.\n  \n#### Goals\n- The protocol aims to achieve two key security properties:\n  - **Secrecy of secrets (sec_1 and sec_2)**: Ensuring that these secrets cannot be disclosed to any unauthorized parties.\n  - **Weak Authentication on the protocol identifier (auth_1)**: Ensuring that both parties can authenticate each other based on the nonce exchange.\n\n#### Intruder Knowledge\n- The environment assumes that the intruder has knowledge of both agents (Alice and Bob), which is crucial for assessing the protocol's security against potential attacks.\n\n---\n\nThis description captures the essence of the provided HLPSL protocol and the roles within it. If you're looking to create an HLPSL file based on this description, the provided structure can be used to translate into code formatted appropriately for HLPSL with definitions for agents, roles, transitions, and security goals."]]}, "HLPSL-1/Anonymous_E2E_authenticated_key_exchange_scheme.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "role user (U, S, F: agent, Kus, Rus, Kas: symmetric_key, Ks: public_key, H, Mul: hash_func, SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by U def=\n\n  local State: nat,\n       SPWim, SAim, Ri, SIDim, Umi, Bmi, Tim, Nfp, Nfp1, Qp, Cim1, G, B1mi, Aim, Wmi, Ymi, Dm, Kmi, B2mi, Dmi, Rim, Uim, Ynj, IDsm, Cim2, Kua, Xm, Bpm, A: text\n\n  init State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n% Registration phase\n\n\t1.

This protocol operates in a dynamic environment where the various participants interact with each other, primarily focusing on registration, mutual authentication, and key exchange.\n\nHere is a detailed description of the protocol:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**1. Roles:**\n   - **User (U)**: The client who registers and authenticates to the server.\n   - **Server (S)**: The entity that verifies the user's identity and aids them in authentication.\n   - **Foreign (F)**: An independent role that participates in the authentication and must interact securely with both the user and server.\n\n**2. Initial Setup:**\n   - The protocol begins with both the user and server establishing a mutual understanding of cryptographic keys, which are used to secure communication and safeguard sensitive information.\n\n**3. Registration Phase:**\n   - **User Registration**: The user initiates the registration process by sending a start signal to the server. The server responds by generating and sending back a hashed password and a unique identifier. This phase involves the generation of several secret keys and the storage of sensitive data such as user credentials in the respective smart cards.\n\n   - The user computes the binary form used during communication and sends it back to the server. The server performs integrity checks and securely stores the user's hashed information.\n\n**4. Mutual Authentication and Key Exchange Stage:**\n   - The user initiates the authentication by sending a computed value involving their unique identifier and the mutually derived secret key.\n\n   - The server, upon receiving the user's message, computes its response based on a shared key derivation, which ensures the integrity and authenticity of messages between the two parties. \n\n   - The foreign role interacts with both the user and server to facilitate further verification through nonce values. The foreign role also generates complementary security tokens that enable continued secure communication.\n\n**5. Security Goals:**\n   - The protocol aims to ensure the secrecy of several cryptographic values (g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6) that are critical for maintaining confidentiality throughout the session.\n   - It seeks to authenticate messages exchanged in the protocol (user-to-server and server-to-user) and confirm their legitimacy through timestamped assertions.\n\n**6. Dynamic Interactions:**\n   - The protocol supports dynamic operations allowing a user to communicate securely with the server and assert the foreign role while ensuring that even if some part of the communication is intercepted, the underlying secrets remain secured.\n\n**7. Environmental Setup:**\n   - The protocol is executed in an environment where variables are set for agents (U, S, F), their keys, and cryptographic functions. This encapsulates interactions and lays out session compositions for various agents to interact securely.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis protocol provides a well-structured method for secure user authentication and key exchange involving multiple parties. Each role has defined responsibilities and ensures the confidentiality and integrity of exchanges through cryptographic practices. The outlined transitions and states reflect a thorough security design towards maintaining user privacy and ensuring authenticity in digital communications. \n\n---\n\nYou may now create an HLPSL file from this description, incorporating the elements of roles, transitions, security goals, and environmental structure as seen in the initial file."]]}, "HLPSL-1/An_Autonomous_Log_Storage_Management_Protocol_with_Blockchain_Mechanism_and_Access_Control_for_the_Internet_of_Things.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "role user (A, S, U: agent, Kau: symmetric_key, ECDSA: public_key, H, Add, Mul, Pair: hash_func, SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by U def=\nlocal State: nat,\nIDi, TIDi, Ys, Alpha, SK, Ss, Ce, C, Hs, Sig, G, M, Y, X, IP, T: text\ninit State := 0\ntransition\n% User registration phase\n1.

This description can then be used to regenerate a corresponding HLPSL file that can be executed by the AVISPA tool.\n\n---\n\n## Protocol Description: User-Server Mutual Authentication Protocol\n\n### Overview\nThe User-Server Mutual Authentication Protocol is designed to securely authenticate users to a server using symmetric encryption and hash functions. The protocol includes a registration phase and a mutual authentication phase to ensure both parties can confirm each other's identities before proceeding with secure communication.\n\n### Participants\nThe protocol involves two main roles:\n1. **User (U)**: The client who wishes to authenticate and communicate with the server.\n2. **Server (S)**: The service provider that the user is attempting to authenticate with.\n\n### Keys and Functions\n- **Kus**: A symmetric key shared between the user and the server.\n- **T**: A hash function, specifically a Chebyshev polynomial, used for secure message transformations.\n- **H**: A hash function used for generating cryptographic hashes from data.\n\n### Phases of the Protocol\n\n#### 1. Registration Phase\n- The user initiates the registration by sending a message to the server containing a unique ID, session IDs, a password, and some random values.\n- The server computes several derived values necessary for the authentication process using the received information and sends back two challenge values to the user.\n\n#### 2. Mutual Authentication Phase\n- After receiving the server's challenge, the user uses the information to compute authentication materials, which include a message and a key derived from previous values.\n- The user sends a message containing a hash of their identity and the computed values back to the server.\n- The server verifies the user's message using its computed values and responds with its own hash for mutual verification.\n- A successful exchange of these hashes confirms the mutual authentication, allowing subsequent secure communications.\n\n### States\n- The protocol maintains three primary states:\n  - **State 0**: The initial state where the registration process starts.\n  - **State 1**: The state where the user and server exchange challenge values.\n  - **State 2**: The final state following successful authentication, confirming both parties' identities.\n\n### Security Goals\nThe protocol aims to achieve:\n- **Secrecy**: Maintaining the confidentiality of critical protocol elements (e.g., passwords, keys) to prevent unauthorized access.\n- **Authentication**: Ensuring that both the user and server can confirm each other\u2019s identity through the challenge-response mechanism, thus preventing impersonation attacks.\n\n### Environment\nThe environment plays a crucial role in setting up the protocol's execution by defining agents, keys, and interactions that simulate potential intruder actions while maintaining the inherent security properties of the protocol.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis User-Server Mutual Authentication Protocol provides a structured approach to secure communications between a client and a server, leveraging cryptographic techniques to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and mutual authentication.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive overview of the protocol, highlighting its main components and objectives, which can then be used to create an HLPSL file that retains the structure and logic needed for verification with the AVISPA tool."]]}, "HLPSL-1/CHAPv2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: (MS-)CHAPv2\n%% Challenge/Response Authentication Protocol, version 2\n%% PURPOSE:\n%% Mutual authentication between a server and a client who share a password.\n%% CHAPv2 is the authentication protocol for the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\n%% suite (PPTP).\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\cite{RFC2759}\n%% MODELER:\n%%\\begin{itemize}\n%%\\item Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n%%\\item Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z\\\"urich\n%%\\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% We assume that the server \\verb!B! and client \\verb!A! share \n%% password \\verb!k(A,B)! in advance.

It serves as the authentication mechanism primarily utilized in the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) suite, establishing a secure channel for user authentication over potentially insecure networks.\n\n#### Purpose\nThe main goal of (MS-)CHAPv2 is to enable secure mutual authentication between two parties: a client and a server. This ensures that both the client and the server can verify each other's identity before any sensitive data is exchanged.\n\n#### Overview of the Authentication Process\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The client (A) starts the authentication process by sending its identifier to the server (B).\n   \n2. **Challenge**:\n   - The server responds by sending back a randomly generated nonce (Nb) to the client, which acts as a challenge.\n\n3. **Response**:\n   - The client generates its own nonce (Na) and computes a hash using the shared password and the two nonces along with its identifier. The client sends this hash along with its nonce back to the server.\n\n4. **Verification**:\n   - The server computes the expected hash using the shared password and Na, and sends this hash back to the client to complete the mutual authentication process.\n\nIn this interaction, both parties generate unique nonces that assist in mitigating replay attacks and ensuring freshness of the authentication process.\n\n#### Limitation\nThe protocol abstracts numerous details relating to the specific message structures, such as bit lengths and concrete formatting. This simplification can lead to potential redundancies but allows for a focus on the essential flow and dependencies within the protocol. These abstractions are relevant within the context of the Dolev-Yao model of adversarial behavior.\n\n#### Security Goals\n1. **Secrecy**: It ensures that the shared session key is kept secret from adversaries.\n2. **Authentication**: It guarantees that both parties are authenticated to each other\u2014this is articulated by the capability of the client and server to verify each other\u2019s identities through their respective nonces.\n\n#### Roles and Communication Channels\n- **Agents**: Alice (A) acts as the client and Bob (B) acts as the server.\n- **Communicative Channels**: The interaction utilizes dynamic channels (named Snd and Rcv) for messages exchanged between the agents.\n\n#### Model Verification\nThe protocol is analyzed under several classifications for security problems:\n- Classifications: G1, G2, G12, where G1 and G2 involve authentication guarantees and G12 relates to secrecy.\n- No known attacks are recorded against the specified implementation of this protocol in the HLPSL.\n\n#### Notable Contributors\nThe modeling of (MS-)CHAPv2 was contributed by Haykal Tej from Siemens CT IC 3 in collaboration with Paul Hankes Drielsma from ETH Zurich.\n\n---\n\n### Reconstructed HLPSL File\n\n```hlpsl\n%% PROTOCOL: (MS-)CHAPv2\n%% Challenge/Response Authentication Protocol, version 2\n%% PURPOSE:\n%% Mutual authentication between a server and a client who share a password.\n%% CHAPv2 is the authentication protocol for the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\n%% suite (PPTP).\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\cite{RFC2759}\n%% MODELER:\n%%\\begin{itemize}\n%%\\item Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n%%\\item Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z\\\"urich\n%%\\end{itemize}\n\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% Client (A) and server (B) share a password (k(A,B)).\n%% Nonces Nb and Na are generated by B and A, respectively.\n\n%% Communication Steps\n%% 1.

This enhanced version of the standard DHCP employs a mechanism that allows a client to communicate with a server to authenticate that the server is genuine before proceeding with further actions. The protocol is built on principles outlined in RFC 3118, focusing on security and authentication.\n\n#### Purpose\nThe primary goal of the DHCP-Delayed-Auth protocol is to introduce an additional layer of security in the DHCP communication process, allowing clients to make authentication requests that the server can validate before the client receives its DHCP configuration.\n\n#### Roles\nIn the protocol, there are primarily two roles:\n\n1. **Client (C)**: Represents a DHCP client that initiates an authentication request to the DHCP server.\n2. **Server (S)**: Acts as the DHCP server that processes the authentication request from the client and provides a corresponding authenticated response.\n\n#### Messages Exchange\nThe protocol consists of a sequence of messages exchanged between the client and server:\n\n1. **Client to Server**: The client sends an authentication request (denoted as `delayedAuthReq`) along with a `Time1` nonce, which ensures freshness in the request.\n\n2. **Server to Client**: The server responds with its identity (S), the initial request identifier, a successfully calculated successor of the nonce (`succ(Time1)`), the key identifier associated with the authentication key (`KeyID(K)`), and a hash value generated using HMAC (`H(S, delayedAuthReq, succ(Time1), K)`) to validate the authenticity of the message.\n\n#### Protocol Initialization and State Management\n- The protocol begins with the client in an initial state (State = 0). Upon receiving a start signal, the client transitions to the next state (State = 1), generating a new nonce (`Time1`).\n- The server, in turn, transitions from its initial state upon receiving the client's authentication request, calculates the necessary hash for verification, and sends the signed reply back to the client.\n\n#### Security Considerations\nThe design of the protocol places emphasis on the following security aspects:\n- **Secrecy**: The protocol ensures that the pre-shared secret (`K`) used for hashing remains confidential.\n- **Authentication**: The interaction includes a mechanism that allows the client to ensure the authenticity of the server through the signature hashing process, which contributes to overall trust in the communication.\n- **Replay Protection**: Although the initial model overlooks certain aspects of replay detection, the use of a nonce structure mitigates risks associated with replay attacks by ensuring that each request is unique.\n\n#### Limitations\n- The protocol implementation is simplified and only includes critical checks mandated by the RFC. Various optional checks and features outlined in the RFC are not modeled in this simplified version.\n- Certain technical aspects, such as message length fields, have been omitted owing to the limitations of the HLPSL modeling language.\n\n#### Environmental Setup\nThe protocol is modeled in an environment where multiple instances of both the client and the server can exist, along with an intruder that may attempt to compromise the communication. The environment setup encapsulates agent definitions and intruder knowledge that aims to analyze the security properties of the DHPC-Delayed-Auth protocol.\n\n#### Goals\nThe primary goals of this protocol are:\n- **Secrecy of the shared secret**: Ensuring that the pre-existing shared secret remains confidential.\n- **Authentication verification**: Making sure that the DHCP client can verify the authentication of the DHCP server based on the signed messages exchanged.\n\nThis description encapsulates the essence of the DHCP-Delayed-Auth protocol and serves as a foundation to model it effectively in the HLPSL language for analysis using the AVISPA tool."]]}, "HLPSL-1/Three-factor_fast_authentication_scheme_for_e-health_systems_in_5G_wireless_sensor_network.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "role user (U, S: agent, Kus, SKij: symmetric_key, Ks: public_key, H, H1, H2, H6, H7, H14, H16: hash_func, SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by U def=\n\n  local State: nat,\n        IDi, IDinew, IDj, Nj, PWi, Bi, E, Ej, Xj, V, N, N1, BBi, W, Yij, Tu, Ts, T1, T2, A, As, B, Bs, SKijNew: text, K, Q, Ay, By: message\n\n  init State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n% Registration phase\n\n\t1.

The main roles involved are the **user** (U) and the **server** (S), each with specific states and transitions that manage the communication process.\n\n#### 1. Role Definitions:\n- **User Role**:\n  - Represents the client trying to register and authenticate with the server.\n  - The user goes through two phases: Registration and Login/Authentication.\n  \n- **Server Role**:\n  - Acts as a receiver and verifier of the information sent by the user.\n  - Handles the registration and authentication confirmations in the same two phases as the user.\n\n#### 2. Phase Details:\n- **Registration Phase**:\n  1. **User Registration**:\n     - The user sends their identity (IDi), password (PWi), and a biometric identifier (Bi) to the server. \n     - The server responds with a new nonce (Nj) and sends back a value derived from the user\u2019s information for future communications, including the Yij value.\n     \n- **Login and Initial Authentication Phase**:\n  1. **User Login**:\n     - Upon starting the login, the user enters their credentials (IDi, PWi, Bi) and produces a nonce (N) based on a hashed value of their input.\n     - The user then computes a message (K) which includes a confirmation and sends it to the server.\n  2. **Server Confirmation**:\n     - The server decrypts the received message using their secret key and verifies the information.\n     - It generates a new session key (SKij) and sends back confirmation values to the user.\n\n- **Fast Authentication Phase**:\n  1. **User Fast Authentication**:\n     - The user can initiate a fast authentication process by sending a computed value based on their IDinew and previously established parameters.\n  2. **Server Fast Confirmation**:\n     - The server validates the received fast authentication request and sends back a confirmation.\n\n#### 3. Security Goals:\n- The protocol aims to ensure the secrecy of the sensitive information exchanged (e.g., user credentials, session keys) and provides authentication assurances between the user and server.\n\n#### 4. Environment and Intruder Model:\n- The environment sets up the user and server roles with their respective keys and hash functions.\n- The intruder has knowledge of the public keys and can impersonate any agent in the system, allowing the analysis of potential vulnerabilities.\n\nThis protocol is designed to provide strong security guarantees for both user data and authentication processes through layered cryptographic measures to resist attacks such as replay or impersonation.\n\n### Note:\nThe above description encapsulates the key aspects of the HLPSL defined protocol while maintaining consistency with the constructs and goals outlined in the provided HLPSL code.

This protocol leverages strong password authentication to establish a symmetric key (Kab) without transmitting the password itself over the communication channels.\n\n### Variant\nThis description specifically covers the variant of the SPEKE protocol that incorporates strong password-only authentication.\n\n### Purpose\nThe primary aim of the SPEKE protocol is to enable two parties (Alice and Bob) to securely establish a common secret key through a series of message exchanges, even in the presence of an adversary who may eavesdrop or interfere with messages being sent.\n\n### Key Components\n- **Shared Password**: The protocol relies on a shared password (S(A,B)), known beforehand to both Alice and Bob.\n- **Nonce Values**: Each participant generates a unique nonce (Na for Alice and Nb for Bob) to ensure the freshness of the communication and prevent replay attacks.\n- **Message Structure**: The key exchange consists of multiple messages exchanged between Alice and Bob, which are encrypted using the derived key (K) that is based on the shared password and the nonces.\n\n### Protocol Steps\n1. **Key Exchange Initialization**:\n   - Alice sends a message to Bob containing the result of an exponential operation using the shared password and her nonce (Na).\n   - Bob replies with a similar operation using Alice's message and his nonce (Nb).\n\n2. **Challenge/Response Mechanism**:\n   - Alice and Bob exchange challenge messages (Ca and Cb respectively) that are tied to their derived key (K).\n   - These messages contribute to verifying that each participant possesses the correct shared password without revealing the password itself.\n\n3. **Authentication**:\n   - Alice and Bob authenticate each other based on the challenges they send to one another.\n   - The successful exchange of challenges ensures that both parties are indeed who they claim to be and have the correct shared password.\n\n### Roles\n- **Alice Role (speke_Init)**: Responsible for initiating the protocol and sending the first message along with nonce and challenge generation.\n- **Bob Role (speke_Resp)**: Responsible for responding to Alice's messages, generating his nonce and challenges, and sending replies to Alice.\n\n### Security Goals\nThe SPEKE protocol aims to achieve the following security properties:\n- **Confidentiality**: Ensure that the challenge messages (Ca, Cb) remain secret from any eavesdroppers (including an intruder). \n- **Authentication**: Verify the identities of both parties. Specifically, Alice must authenticate Bob, and Bob must authenticate Alice through their respective challenge messages.\n\n### Summary\nThe SPEKE protocol is a powerful mechanism for secure password-based authentication and key exchange. By employing nonces and challenge-response techniques, it mitigates risks associated with password transmission and establishes robust mutual authentication. The effectiveness of the protocol is guaranteed under the assumption that the shared password remains secret and resilient against brute-force attacks.\n\n### References\nThe specification of the SPEKE protocol, alongside its formal model, can be found in the works of Jablon et al. and various contributions from Haykal Tej and Sebastian M\u00f6dersheim.\n\n### Limitations and Known Problems\nCurrently, there are no inherent limitations noted within the protocol, and no known attacks have been identified that compromise its security.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed description can serve as the basis for understanding the SPEKE protocol and can be translated back to an HLPSL specification for modeling and analysis using the AVISPA tools."]]}, "HLPSL-1/ISO2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL*: ISO2 Public Key Unilateral Authentication Protocol\n%% VARIANT: two-pass unilateral authentication\n%% PURPOSE: Authentication of a client to a server.

Here\u2019s the corresponding description content that details the protocol, making it suitable for generating a corresponding HLPSL file that can be run by AVISPA.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: ISO2 Public Key Unilateral Authentication Protocol\n\n#### Overview\nThe ISO2 Public Key Unilateral Authentication Protocol is designed to facilitate the authentication of a client (referred to as Alice) to a server (referred to as Bob). The purpose of this protocol is to enable the server to verify the identity of the client by initiating a session, which the client responds to with a digital signature. \n\n#### Variants\n- Two-pass unilateral authentication\n\n#### Purpose\n- The primary goal of this protocol is to ensure that Bob can authenticate Alice's identity through a secure communication channel.\n\n#### Reference\n- The formalization of this protocol can be found in:\n  - Clark, J. and B. J. (1997). \"A survey of public-key cryptography.\" \n  - ISO/IEC 9798-3: Information technology \u2013 Security techniques \u2013 Entity authentication mechanisms.\n\n#### Modelers\n- Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n- Luca Compagna et al, AI-Lab DIST University of Genova, November 2004\n\n#### Protocol Description\nThe protocol can be broken down into the following steps:\n\n1. **Server to Client (Bob to Alice)**: \n   - Bob sends a random number \\( Rb \\) along with a text message \\( Text1 \\) to Alice.\n   \n   2. **Client to Server (Alice to Bob)**: \n   - Alice responds by sending her public key \\( PKa \\) along with her identity, \n     the random number \\( Ra \\), the previously received \\( Rb \\), the server's identity \\( B \\), and a text message \\( Text2 \\).\n   - Additionally, Alice includes an encrypted message \u2014 this message comprises \\( Ra \\), \\( Rb \\), the server\u2019s identity, and \\( Text1 \\) which is encrypted using her private key. \n\n#### Problem Classification\n- The protocol is classified as G1 and G2 indicating its focus on authentication and secrecy.\n\n#### Attack Resistance\n- The protocol is designed to be secure against known attacks, and currently, there are no identified vulnerabilities or attacks.\n\n#### Definitions\n- \\( inv(PKs) \\) denotes the private key corresponding to the public key of the server \\( C \\).\n- \\( \\{PKa, A\\}_inv(PKs) \\) represents the certificate of agent \\( A \\).\n\n### Roles\n- **iso2_Init (B, A)**: This role represents the server (Bob) initiating the protocol by sending a challenge to the client (Alice).\n- **iso2_Resp (A, B)**: This role represents the client (Alice) responding to the challenge with a signed message verifying her identity.\n- **session (B, A)**: The composition of both roles, representing the complete protocol execution.\n- **environment**: Represents the environment in which the protocol executes with intruder capabilities modeled.\n\n### Goals\n- The explicit goal of the protocol is to authenticate \\( ISO2\\_Resp \\) on a specified protocol identifier \\( ra \\) addressing security classes G1 and G2.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive summary of the protocol that can be used to understand its mechanics and will aid in constructing the HLPSL file for necessary simulation and analysis with AVISPA."]]}, "HLPSL-1/Kerberos.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)\n%% VARIANT: basic (core)\n%% PURPOSE: Authentication, Authorisation, Key Exchange\n%%\n%% Kerberos is a distributed authentication service that allows a process\n%% (a client) running on behalf of a principal (a user) to prove its identity\n%% to a verifier (an application server, or just server) without sending data\n%% across the network that might allow an attacker or the verifier to\n%% subsequently impersonate the principal.

Kerberos allows clients to verify their identity to servers without sending sensitive credentials across the network, thus reducing the risk of impersonation by attackers.\n\n### Purpose\n\nThe primary aims of this protocol are:\n- **Authentication**: Verifying the identity of clients and servers.\n- **Authorization**: Ensuring that the client has the right to access the requested service.\n- **Key Exchange**: Facilitating the secure exchange of keys necessary for further secure communication.\n\n### Roles Involved\n\n1. **Client (C)**: The entity that requests access to a service.\n2. **Authentication Server (A)**: The server responsible for verifying the identity of the client and providing the necessary credentials.\n3. **Ticket Granting Server (G)**: This server issues tickets that grant access to specific services after verifying requests from the client.\n4. **Target Server (S)**: The server that provides the service the client wants to access.\n\n### Protocol Flow\n\n1. **Initial Request**: The client sends a request to the Authentication Server (A) providing its identity, the server it wants to communicate with, the desired ticket lifetime, and a nonce (N1) to prevent replay attacks.\n   \n2. **Ticket Granting**: The Authentication Server responds with a ticket (Ticket_1), which contains a session key (K_CG) for the connection between the client and the Ticket Granting Server, along with expiration details. This ticket is encrypted with the Authentication Server's key.\n   \n3. **Requesting Service Ticket**: The client uses Ticket_1 to request a service ticket from the Ticket Granting Server (G) by sending it the server's identity, lifetime for the service ticket, another nonce (N2), and the Ticket_1 along with the client's session key.\n   \n4. **Service Ticket Issuance**: The Ticket Granting Server processes this request and issues the service ticket (Ticket_2), containing a session key (K_CS), to the client.\n   \n5. **Accessing the Server**: The client forwards Ticket_2 to the server (S) they want to access, along with a confirmation of identity encrypted with the service's session key.\n   \n6. **Service Confirmation**: The server responds, also confirming the client's identity by sending back a message encrypted with the service's session key.\n\n### Security Considerations\n\n- **Time Stamping**: Tickets are associated with start and expiration times to ensure they are valid for only a limited period.\n  \n- **Weak Authentication**: While Kerberos provides mechanisms for authentication and authorization, it has limitations. For instance, the lack of ticket caching introduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited for replay or impersonation attacks.\n\n### Limitations\n\n- The protocol currently does not perform ticket caching, which may weaken the authentication process. Implementations that neglect ticket management may be subject to vulnerabilities.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Kerberos V5 protocol establishes a framework that efficiently handles authentication and secure key exchange between distributed systems. While it is robust in providing the necessary security assurances, attention must be paid to limitations and potential vulnerabilities to ensure its reliable use in real-world applications.\n\n### References\n\nFor further details, please refer to the following document:\n- [Kerberos Clarifications](http://www.ietf.org/internet-drafts/draft-ietf-krb-wg-kerberos-clarifications-07.txt)\n\n### Modelers\n\nThe protocol has been modeled by:\n- Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n- Sebastian M\u00f6dersheim, Computer Security Group, ETH Z\u00fcrich, January 2004\n- AVISPA team (since then)\n\n### AVISPA Logical Goals\n\nThe protocol's security goals concerning secrecy and weak authentication include:\n- Secrecy of session keys (K_CG, K_CS).\n- Weak authentication guarantees for clients against servers and vice versa.\n\nThis description creates a high-level overview that can be utilized to recreate the corresponding HLPSL file for analysis in the AVISPA tool."]]}}
