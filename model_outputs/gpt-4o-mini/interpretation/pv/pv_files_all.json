The main objective of the protocol is to securely exchange a message while ensuring confidentiality, using modular exponentiation and encryption/decryption functions.\n\n#### Key Components:\n\n1. **Channel**: \n   - `c`: A free communication channel used for sending and receiving messages between the two principals.\n\n2. **Key Variables**:\n   - `objective`: A bitstring representing the secret message that A wants to send to B.\n\n3. **Functions**:\n   - `exp(base: bitstring, exp: bitstring) : bitstring`: Represents modular exponentiation, which computes \\( \\text{base}^{\\text{exp}} \\).\n   - `mod(value: bitstring, modulus: bitstring) : bitstring`: Computes the value modulo the modulus.\n   - `enc(message: bitstring, key: bitstring) : bitstring`: Encrypts a message using a provided key.\n   - `dec(ciphertext: bitstring, key: bitstring) : bitstring`: Decrypts a ciphertext using the same key.\n\n4. **Equations**:\n   - An equation ensuring the commutativity of the modular exponentiation operation, verifying that the order of exponentiation does not affect the result when the base is the same.\n   - An equation that guarantees the property of decryption: decrypting an encrypted message using the correct key retrieves the original message.\n\n#### Protocol Flow:\n\n1. **Principal A**:\n   - Generates and stores two bitstrings: `P` (a prime or modulus) and `G` (a base for exponentiation).\n   - Generates a random nonce `Na`.\n   - Sends `P` and `G` to principal B.\n   - Calculates the value `mod(exp(G, Na), P)` and sends it to B. This value is a partial key derived from the base and the nonce.\n   - Receives B's message (`B`) and computes a shared secret using `Na`: \\( s = \\text{mod}(exp(B, Na), P) \\).\n   - Encrypts the `objective` message using this shared secret and sends the encrypted message to principal B.\n\n2. **Principal B**:\n   - Generates a fresh nonce `Nb`.\n   - Receives the values `P` and `G` from A.\n   - Receives the result from A (let's call it `A`), which is a partial key sent by A.\n   - Calculates a key `mod(exp(G, Nb), P)` and sends it back to A.\n   - The process generates a shared secret using `s = \\text{mod}(exp(A, Nb), P)`.\n\n#### Security Queries:\n- The protocol includes a query to check if the attacker can retrieve the `objective` message, which is crucial in assessing the protocol's security against eavesdropping or unauthorized access.\n\n### Generating the Corresponding PV File\n\nBy utilizing the above protocol description, the following ProVerif file layout can be structured:\n\n```pv\nfree c : channel.\n\nfree objective : bitstring [private].\n\nfun exp(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\nfun mod(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\n\nequation forall P:bitstring, G:bitstring, x:bitstring, y:bitstring;\n  mod(exp(exp(G, x), y), P) = mod(exp(exp(G, y), x), P).\n\nfun enc(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\nfun dec(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\n  dec(enc(m, k), k) = m.\n\nquery attacker(objective).\n\nlet A =\n  new P:bitstring;\n  new G:bitstring;\n  new Na:bitstring;\n  out(c, (P, G)); (* Send P and G to B *)\n  out(c, mod(exp(G, Na), P)); (* Send the computed value to B *)\n  in(c, B : bitstring); (* Receive B's computed value *)\n  let s = mod(exp(B, Na), P) in\n  out(c, enc(objective, s)).

These comments do not affect the original logic or flow of the code and make it clearer for readers. The final code remains executable and valid for ProVerif."]], "logic": [[true, "The provided ProVerif (pv) file represents a protocol that involves two clients (A and B) and a key retrieval server. Here\u2019s an overview of the protocol and its components, which can be used to generate a corresponding pv file that can be executed by ProVerif.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Overview\nThe protocol facilitates secure communication between two clients, A and B, with the help of a key server that provides public keys and authentication through digital signatures. The protocol follows these main steps:\n\n1. Client A requests Client B's public key from the key server.\n2. Client A sends a nonce \\( N_a \\) encrypted with Client B's public key.\n3. Client B retrieves Client A's public key and sends back a response containing both nonces encrypted with Client A's public key.\n4. Both clients can then verify the authenticity of the messages exchanged.\n\n#### Components\n- **Channels**: The protocol uses a channel `c` for communication between parties.\n- **Bitstrings**: The entities involved (clients and keys) are represented as bitstrings (`A`, `B`, `I`).\n- **Cryptographic Functions**: \n  - `pkey(bitstring)` generates a public key from a private key.\n  - `sign(bitstring, bitstring)` signs a message with a private key.\n  - `checksign(bitstring, bitstring)` verifies a signature against a public key.\n  - `enc(bitstring, bitstring)` encrypts a message.\n  - `dec(bitstring, bitstring)` decrypts an encrypted message.\n  - `aenc(bitstring, bitstring)` and `adec(bitstring, bitstring)` represent asymmetric encryption and decryption, respectively.\n- **Key Management**: A key retrieval server responds to key requests and maintains a list of keys for devices that register with it.\n\n### Processes\n1. **Key Retrieval Server**:\n   - Responds to requests for public keys from clients and serves them through the secure signature mechanism.\n   - Allows clients to register their public keys, storing them securely.\n\n2. **Client A**:\n   - Initiates interaction by requesting Client B's public key.\n   - Sends and receives messages securely using nonce values for authentication.\n\n3. **Client B**:\n   - Responds to Client A's request and initiates a secure communication session by exchanging nonces.\n\n### Security Goals\nThe protocol aims for confidentiality (ensuring only the intended recipients can read the messages) and authenticity (ensuring the messages truly come from the claimed sender) through the use of public key cryptography and digital signatures.\n\n### ProVerif File Generation\nBased on this description, a corresponding ProVerif file can be generated that encodes the same logic and interactions defined in the above description. The specific structure and syntax for ProVerif would follow the functions and processes outlined, integrating the cryptographic primitives defined in the protocol.\n\nTo implement this protocol in a ProVerif file, one would begin by defining the necessary free variables, functions, and processes, ensuring that all cryptographic actions comply with the described security goals and interactions.\n\nThis summarized content can be expanded further into code following ProVerif syntax, ensuring logical consistency with the described protocol dynamics. The original code structure should be preserved for correctness, while ensuring that variables and functions are correctly utilized within the new context."]]}, "PV-1/NSLPK-secrecy.pv": {"code": [[true, "(* The code modeling key server interaction is copied from ProVerif's Needham-Schroeder examples *)\nfree c : channel.\n\nfree A : bitstring.

The protocol facilitates secure key exchange and authentication between the clients by utilizing asymmetric cryptographic methods, including digital signatures and asymmetric encryption.\n\n#### Roles\n1. **Client A (Alice)**: Initiates the protocol by requesting the public key of client B.\n2. **Client B (Bob)**: Responds to requests from client A and sends messages back to complete the authentication and key exchange.\n3. **Key Server (S)**: Maintains a mapping of clients to their public keys and handles key retrieval requests securely.\n\n#### Variables\n- **Channels**: A communication channel (c) for message exchange.\n- **Keys**: Each client has a secret key (skA for A and skB for B) and a corresponding public key (pkA for A and pkB for B).\n- **Nonces**: Nonce values (Na for A and Nb for B) are generated to ensure freshness of the protocol.\n\n#### Functions\n- **pkey**: Generates a public key from a given secret key.\n- **sign**: Creates a digital signature for a given message using a secret key.\n- **checksign**: Verifies a digital signature against the public key to ensure authenticity.\n- **enc/dec**: Functions for encrypting and decrypting messages using a symmetric key.\n- **aenc/adec**: Asymmetric encryption and decryption functions.\n\n#### Protocol Steps\n1. **Client A Initiation**:\n   - Client A generates a nonce (Na) and requests the public key of Client B by sending (A, I) to the key server.\n   - The key server responds with the signed public key of Client B, ensuring its integrity.\n   - Client A encrypts the nonce and its identity, sending the message to Client B encrypted with Client B's public key.\n\n2. **Client B Response**:\n   - Upon receiving the request, Client B decrypts the message to retrieve the nonce (Na) and verifies its identity.\n   - Client B generates its own nonce (Nb) and sends an encrypted response containing both nonces and its identity back to Client A.\n\n3. **Confirmation**:\n   - Client A decrypts the response from Client B, receives the nonce Nb, and confirms the identities and the freshness of the exchanged nonces.\n\n4. **Key Retrieval and Registration**:\n   - The key server can serve both retrieval and registration functionalities, allowing new clients to register their public keys securely and allowing clients to retrieve known public keys.\n\n#### Security Queries\n- The protocol ensures that the nonces are fresh and that only authorized clients can retrieve public keys. An attacker query is included to check for potential vulnerabilities in the protocol.\n\n---\n\n### Method to Generate the Corresponding PV File\nTo generate the corresponding ProVerif file from this description content, you would implement the outlined roles, processes, and functions following the structure of the provided PV file.

This description captures the essential elements and processes of the protocol, which can be used to regenerate a corresponding PV file.\n\n---\n\n### Description of the Otway-Rees Protocol\n\n**Overview:**\nThe Otway-Rees protocol is a cryptographic protocol designed for secure communication between two hosts (A and B) with the involvement of a trusted server (S). It aims to provide mutual authentication and key distribution services, ensuring that only the intended parties can communicate securely.\n\n**Participants:**\n- **Hosts:**\n  - A: Initiator (client)\n  - B: Responder (server/client)\n- **Server:**\n  - S: Trusted third party that facilitates the exchange of keys.\n\n**Elements:**\n- **Nonces:**\n  - `Na`, `Nb`: Unique random values generated by the initiator and responder respectively, to ensure freshness of the session.\n- **Keys:**\n  - `Kas`: Key shared between host A and server S.\n  - `Kbs`: Key shared between host B and server S.\n  - `k`: A new session key established during the protocol execution.\n\n**Process Steps:**\n1. **Initiator Role (A):**\n   - Host A starts the protocol by sending a message to host B involving a nonce `Na`, identity of the hosts, and a message encrypted with the shared key `kA` (where `kA` is the key known by A and S).\n   - The message contains the components: (C, A, B, `encrypt(Na, C, A, B)`).\n\n2. **Responder Role (B):**\n   - Host B receives the message from A and decrypts it using its shared key `kB`.\n   - After verifying the message, B generates its own nonce `Nb` and replies to A by sending the newly generated nonce and an encrypted message that includes both nonces and other identifying information.\n\n3. **Server Role (S):**\n   - Server S receives the messages from both A and B. It independently verifies the received nonces using their respective keys, generates a new session key `k`, and sends this back to both A and B securely.\n\n4. **Key Registration:**\n   - There is a setup for host names and their respective keys in a key table stored within the server. This facilitates future messages between A and B via proper encryption and decryption.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n- **Secrecy:** The protocol ensures that only the intended recipients can decrypt and access the messages exchanged.\n- **Non-interference:** The private bitstrings `secretA` and `secretB` are not interfered with by attackers, ensuring that their confidentiality is retained throughout the execution of the protocol.\n\n**Concurrency:**\n- The protocol supports simultaneous sessions between participants, with the ability for multiple initiator and responder instances to operate concurrently.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- The protocol's security properties are confirmed through automated verification, demonstrating that private bitstrings maintain their confidentiality and security against active attackers.\n\n---\n\nThis description encapsulates the salient features and structure of the Otway-Rees protocol, providing a basis for understanding how the corresponding PV file might be constructed and analyzed with the ProVerif tool."]]}, "PV-1/piskeme.pi": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The original functionality and logic of the code remain unchanged, ensuring compatibility with ProVerif."]], "logic": [[true, "Based on the provided Pi file description, I will generate a textual description of the cryptographic protocol in focus. This description will cover the main components, processes, and assumptions made in the protocol.\n\n---\n\n### Description of the Protocol\n\n#### Overview\nThe protocol described operates in a public-key cryptographic context and employs mechanisms for secure communication between two parties, labeled as Alice (A) and Bob (B). It consists of a key exchange phase followed by secure message transmission, utilizing various cryptographic functions, including encryption, decryption, and hashing.\n\n#### Cryptographic Foundations\n1. **Key Generation**: Each participant (Alice and Bob) generates their private keys, denoted as `skA` and `skB`, and subsequently derives their public keys, `pkA` and `pkB`, using a public key function `pk`.\n\n2. **Cryptographic Functions**:\n   - `encrypt(m, pk)`: Encrypts message `m` with the public key `pk`.\n   - `decrypt(c, sk)`: Decrypts ciphertext `c` using the private key `sk`.\n   - `hash(m)`: Computes the hash of message `m`.\n   - `keyhash(k, m)`: Generates a keyed hash of message `m` using key `k`.\n   - `sencrypt(m, k)`: Symmetrically encrypts message `m` with a shared key `k`.\n   - `sdecrypt(c, k)`: Decrypts the ciphertext `c` using the symmetric key `k`.\n\n3. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: The protocol includes a Diffie-Hellman mechanism for generating shared secrets between Alice and Bob, facilitated by the functions `f` and `g`, which ensure the commutative property of key generation.\n\n#### Protocol Execution\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Alice and Bob exchange their public keys over a communication channel (denoted as `c`).\n   - Alice creates a new session key (`Ka`), encrypts it together with her public key, and sends it, along with a value derived from the Diffie-Hellman computation.\n\n2. **Alice's Process (processA)**:\n   - After sending the initial message, Alice waits to receive a tuple containing an encrypted message, a value derived from Bob's Diffie-Hellman output, and a keyed hash.\n   - Upon receiving this information, she decrypts the received message to obtain Bob's session key (`Kb`), hashes her session key with Bob's session key, and verifies the keyed hash sent by Bob.\n   - If the verification is successful, she generates a new shared hash and sends a keyed hash as a response. If Bob's public key matches hers, Alice also sends the symmetric encryption of her secret.\n\n3. **Bob's Process (processB)**:\n   - Bob starts by receiving Alice's initial message, which includes encrypted data containing Alice's session key.\n   - He decrypts this message to retrieve Alice\u2019s session key and generates his session key (`Kb`), processes received values for key generation, and sends his information back to Alice.\n   - After receiving Alice's response, Bob verifies the keyed hash and, if successful, sends his own secret encrypted with a derived shared hash back to Alice.\n\n#### Assumptions and Security Properties\n- The protocol makes foundational secrecy assumptions regarding the private keys (`skA`, `skB`) and shared secrets (`secretA`, `secretB`).\n- Non-interference properties are established for both `secretA` and `secretB`, asserting that the secrets remain secure and do not interfere with each other during protocol operations.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis cryptographic protocol exemplifies a secure communication mechanism leveraging public-key infrastructure, Diffie-Hellman exchanges, and symmetric encryption, ensuring confidentiality and integrity of messages shared between participants.\n\n---\n\nThis structured description provides a comprehensive and clear understanding of the protocol.

It relies on cryptographic techniques to secure messages and verify the identities of the participants.\n\n**Participants:**\n- **A**: The initiator of the communication.\n- **B**: The responder who receives requests from A.\n- **S**: A trusted third-party server that assists in authentication.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- **Shared keys**: The protocol employs shared keys (`kAS` and `kBS`) between pairs of participants to encrypt and decrypt messages.\n- **Freshness**: A nonce (`N`) is generated by B to ensure that the communication is fresh and to prevent replay attacks.\n\n**Message Flow:**\n1. **Initiation by A**: \n   - A sends its identifier to B.\n\n2. **Nonce Generation by B**:\n   - B responds with a freshly generated nonce (`N`).\n\n3. **Authentication Message**:\n   - A combines its identifier, B's identifier, and the nonce (`N`) and encrypts this information using `kAS`. \n   - The encrypted message is sent to B.\n\n4. **Forwarding the Information to the Server (S)**:\n   - B receives the encrypted message from A and forwards it to the trusted server (S), encrypting it with `kBS` for secrecy.\n\n5. **Server Response**:\n   - The server decrypts the message to verify authenticity and freshness. It then re-encrypts the nonce and sends it back to B.\n\n6. **Verification by B**:\n   - B decrypts the message received from S. If the decrypted contents match the expected values (host identifiers and nonce), B can confirm A's identity.\n\n**Secrecy Assumptions:**\n- The keys used in the protocol (`kAS` and `kBS`) are assumed to be secret and not known to any adversary.\n- The protocol's design incorporates events to track the flow and detect any anomalies or potential attacks.\n\n**Security Claims:**\nThe protocol verifies that under typical conditions, the expected properties of authentication and confidentiality are maintained. The formal verification results indicate that the expected behavior (events) holds true, meaning no unauthorized access or message interception is possible.\n\n**Termination and Attacks:**\nAt certain stages of the protocol, as indicated by formal analysis through ProVerif, adversaries may attempt to engage in attacks. Therefore, verifying the absence of specific attack patterns is crucial for confirming the protocol's resilience against potential vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\nThe above description succinctly summarizes the workings of the WooLam shared-key authentication protocol and can be used as a basis to regenerate the corresponding Pi file for running through ProVerif.

Below is a descriptive content of the given protocol, reformulated for clarity and comprehension, while maintaining the essential elements that would allow someone to generate the corresponding ProVerif (pv) file as you provided.\n\n---\n\n### Description of the SKEME Protocol\n\n**Overview:**\n\nThe SKEME (Secure Key Exchange Mechanism) protocol is designed to securely establish a shared secret key between two parties, Alice (A) and Bob (B), using public-key cryptography, nonce values, and Diffie-Hellman principles. The protocol facilitates secure communication by enabling Alice and Bob to derive a shared session key without exposing their private keys or any sensitive information to potential attackers.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n- **Channels:** The protocol operates over a communication channel denoted as `c`.\n- **Cryptographic primitives:**\n  - **Public Key Cryptography:** Each participant has a pair of keys (public key `pk` and secret key `sk`). The public key can be shared openly, while the secret key must remain confidential.\n  - **Nonce:** A random value (`nonce`) that ensures freshness and prevents replay attacks.\n  - **Hash Function:** A hash function (`hash`) is used to derive session keys from other values.\n  - **Diffie-Hellman Exponentiation:** The protocol employs a base `g` along with exponentiation to compute shared values securely.\n  - **Keyed Hash Function:** Ensures that hash outputs can only be computed using a specific key.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Alice generates her secret key `skA` and computes her public key `pkA`.\n   - Bob generates his secret key `skB` and computes his public key `pkB`.\n\n2. **Exchange of Public Keys:**\n   - Alice sends her public key `pkA` to Bob.\n   - Bob sends his public key `pkB` back to Alice.\n\n3. **Session Key Creation by Alice (processA):**\n   - Alice receives a public key `pkX` from Bob.\n   - She generates a new random exponent `x` and computes `gx = exp(g, x)`.\n   - Alice creates a nonce `Ka` and sends encrypted data to Bob containing both her public key and the nonce, as well as the value `gx`.\n   - Alice expects to receive responses from Bob, containing specific values that allow her to compute a shared session key.\n\n4. **Session Key Creation by Bob (processB):**\n   - Bob receives the encrypted message from Alice and decrypts it to extract Alice's public key `pkAr` and nonce `Ka`.\n   - Bob creates a new nonce `Kb` and generates a random exponent `y`, computing `gy = exp(g, y)`.\n   - He sends a response back to Alice with encrypted nonce `Kb`, the value `gy`, and a hash confirming the integrity of the exchanged data.\n   - Bob expects another message from Alice to finalize the session key establishment.\n\n5. **Key Agreement Validation:**\n   - Upon receiving Bob's response, Alice validates the integrity of the communication by checking a hash value.\n   - If valid, both Alice and Bob derive a shared session key based on the exchanged values and the generated nonces.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n- **Confidentiality of Secrets:** The secrets `secretA` and `secretB` must remain confidential and are not to be revealed during the execution of the protocol against potential attackers.\n- **Non-interference:** The protocol guarantees that the secrets of Alice and Bob do not interfere with one another's operations, thereby maintaining secrecy and integrity.\n\n---\n\nBy following this description, one can create a ProVerif implementation of the SKEME protocol, ensuring public key operations, nonce handling, and security properties are properly represented in the programming language structure."]]}, "PV-1/WooLamPK.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Below is a high-level description of the protocol, formatted in a way that captures the main features necessary to develop a corresponding ProVerif pv file.\n\n---\n\n### Description of the Woo and Lam Public-Key Authentication Protocol\n\n#### Overview\nThe Woo and Lam public-key authentication protocol is a cryptographic protocol designed to authenticate two parties, A and B, using public-key techniques. The protocol facilitates secure communication and ensures that both parties can verify each other's identities without disclosing sensitive information.\n\n#### Protocol Steps\n1. **Initiation**: \n   - The protocol begins with agent A sending its identity (A) to agent B over a communication channel.\n\n2. **Challenge Generation**:\n   - Upon receiving A's identity, B generates a nonce (N) \u2013 a random number used only once \u2013 and sends it back to A.\n\n3. **Response with Signature**:\n   - A receives the nonce N, signs it with its secret key (skA), and sends the resulting signed message back to B. This signature guarantees that A is indeed the sender of the message and has possession of its secret key.\n\n4. **Server Interaction**:\n   - After the initial exchanges, B forwards A's identity (A) to a trusted server (S). \n   - The server verifies A's identity using its own secret key (skS) and responds by sending back A's identity along with a signed message containing A's public key (pkA).\n\n**Key Registration**: \n- The protocol includes a process for registering host identities with their respective public keys, ensuring authenticated identities within the system.\n\n#### Security Properties\n- **Authentication**: It is guaranteed that A's and B's identities are authenticated during the exchange.\n- **Confidentiality**: Nonces and secret keys are not exposed during the protocol.\n- **Secrecy Assumptions**: The secret keys of A, B, and S are presumed secret and not disclosed to the attacker.\n\n#### Potential Attacks\nDespite full agreement being confirmed in some cases, vulnerabilities exist:\n- An attacker might intercept messages in such a manner that causes both participants to remain unaware of manipulation (e.g., the messages never mention B directly). \n- If an adversary is able to influence the messages being exchanged, the assurance of mutual authentication could be compromised.\n\n#### Query Descriptions\nThe protocol makes use of defined events such as `beginBparam` and `endBparam` to track the beginning and completion of authentication steps between agents, allowing ProVerif to check for potential attacks on the protocol's security guarantees.\n\n---\n\nThis description can be utilized to understand the underlying mechanics of the Woo and Lam protocol and serve as a guide for crafting a corresponding ProVerif pv file for verification. If needed, the file can be expanded or refined based on specific requirements or additional security analyses."]]}, "PV-1/Yahalom.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Below, I will provide a description of the protocol based on the content of the pv file. This description can serve as a basis for generating a corresponding pv file that can be run by ProVerif.\n\n---\n\n### Description of the Yahalom Protocol\n\nThe Yahalom protocol is designed to facilitate secure communication between two honest parties (identified as A and B) through a trusted server (S). The protocol utilizes nonce values to prevent replay attacks and employs symmetric key cryptography for securing messages between the parties. Below are the main components and roles involved in the protocol:\n\n#### Components:\n\n1. **Keys**: \n   - Each participant (A and B) shares a unique secret key with the server (S). The keys are denoted as `Kas` for the key shared between A and S, and `Kbs` for the key shared between B and S.\n   \n2. **Nonces**: \n   - Nonces are randomly generated values used to ensure freshness of messages. Here, `Na` is the nonce generated by A, and `Nb` is the nonce generated by B.\n\n3. **Host Identifiers**: \n   - Two hosts, A and B, are involved in the communication, and both are assumed to be honest participants.\n\n4. **Cryptographic Functions**:\n   - The encryption and decryption functions are provided, allowing the participants to securely exchange information. The decryption function is proven to correctly retrieve the original message when the correct key is utilized.\n\n#### Process Flow:\n\n1. **Initiator (A)**:\n   - A starts the protocol by sending its identity and a nonce `Na` to the communication channel.\n   - Upon receiving a response from the server with the encrypted message containing B\u2019s identity and both nonces, A verifies the authenticity of the message by decrypting it using its shared key `Kas`.\n   - If the decrypted information is valid, A proceeds to send its secret to B.\n\n2. **Responder (B)**:\n   - B listens for A's initiation and responds with an encrypted message containing A's identity, the nonce sent by A, and a newly generated nonce `Nb`.\n   - B decrypts the message from the server and checks the validity of the nonce before sending a response back to A.\n\n3. **Server (S)**:\n   - The server acts as a mediator, receiving requests from both parties and sending back encrypted messages. It uses the shared keys to ensure secure communication.\n   - The server facilitates the exchange of keys and nonces between the initiator and the responder.\n\n4. **Key Registration**:\n   - Additional functionality is provided for key registration, allowing new hosts to register their keys with the server, thus expanding the network's capabilities.\n\n#### Security Properties:\n\n- The protocol is designed with several security assumptions, particularly around the secrecy of the keys `Kas` and `Kbs`. The non-interference properties ensure that secrets remain confidential among the honest parties.\n- The protocol is built to resist replay attacks through the use of unique nonce values.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nThe Yahalom protocol is a robust framework for secure communications, utilizing key sharing, nonce management, and secure channels. The implementation using the pv language facilitates formal verification of its security properties, ensuring reliable performance in the face of potential attacks.\n\n---\n\nThis description covers the essential elements discussed in the original pv file while adhering to the functionality and operations depicted in the protocol.

The goal is to establish a secure session key (`K_ab`) between Alice and Bob, using a server as a trusted third party. The protocol ensures that both parties have mutual agreement on the session key, while preserving the confidentiality of individual secrets.\n\n**Roles:**\n1. **Alice (A)**: Initiates communication with Bob and uses keys associated with the server (`K_as`) and her own secret key.\n2. **Bob (B)**: Responds to Alice's request and interacts with the server to generate a session key.\n3. **Server (S)**: Facilitates the exchange of information between Alice and Bob and provides session keys.\n\n**Key Exchange Steps:**\n1. **Step 1**: Alice generates a nonce (`N_A`) and sends it along with her identity to Bob over the communication channel `c`. \n   - Message: `A -> B : (A, N_A)`\n\n2. **Step 2**: Upon receiving Alice's message, Bob generates his own nonce (`N_B`) and sends a message containing his identity, `N_B`, and an encrypted version of Alice's identity and `N_A` encrypted with his shared key with the server (`K_b`).\n   - Message: `B -> S : (B, N_B, {A, N_A}_Kbs)`\n\n3. **Step 3**: After Bob's message reaches the server, the server decrypts it and retrieves Alice's identity and nonce. A new session key (`K_ab`) is generated, and the server sends the nonces and encrypted session information back to Alice.\n   - Message: `S -> A : (N_B, {B, K_ab, N_A}_K_as, {A, K_ab, N_B}_K_bs)`\n\n4. **Step 4**: Alice then sends back an encrypted message to Bob, containing Alice's identity, the session key (`K_ab`), and the nonce received from Bob, all encrypted with Bob's secret key.\n   - Message: `A -> B : ({A, K_ab, N_B}_K_bs, {N_B}_K_ab)`\n\n**Security Properties:**\n- **Secrecy**: The protocol protects Alice's and Bob's individual secrets (`secretA`, `secretB`) from the attacker, ensuring they remain confidential throughout the communication.\n- **Event tracking**: The protocol allows for tracking specific events such as when parameters are exchanged or when session keys are established. If an event of interest (like `endAparam` or `beginAparam`) occurs, it can be logged and verified.\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- **Cryptographic Functions**: Utilize functions for encryption and decryption (`encrypt` and `decrypt`).\n- **Nonce Agreement**: There\u2019s no agreement on `N_A`, but both parties agree on `N_B` and the established session key `K_ab`.\n- **Host access**: Mapping and key exchange functions with shared secret keys exist for secure communications.\n\n---\n\nWith this description, a corresponding Pi file can be drafted and tested within the ProVerif tool to verify the security properties of the defined protocol."]]}, "PV-1/denning-sacco-orig.horntype": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Below is a description content that outlines the protocol implemented in the provided HornType code:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Overview\nThis protocol is designed for secure communication among three parties: Alice (A), Bob (B), and a Server (S). The protocol leverages cryptographic techniques like digital signatures and encryption to ensure the integrity, authenticity, and confidentiality of the exchanged messages.\n\n#### Participants\n1. **Alice (A)**: Initiator of the protocol, possessing a secret key `sA` and corresponding public key `pk(sA)`.\n2. **Bob (B)**: Respondent in the protocol, possessing a secret key `sB` and corresponding public key `pk(sB)`.\n3. **Server (S)**: Authentication authority that holds a secret key `sS` and corresponding public key `pk(sS)`.\n\n#### Cryptographic Primitives\n- **Sign**: A function `sign(m, sk)` that generates a digital signature of the message `m` using the secret key `sk`.\n- **Encrypt**: A function `encrypt(m, pk)` that encrypts the message `m` using the public key `pk`.\n- **Secure Encryption**: A function `sencrypt(m, k)` that securely encrypts the message `m` with a symmetric key `k`.\n\n#### Initialization\n- All participants have public keys initialized and made available to the network:\n  - `c(pk(sA[]))`\n  - `c(pk(sB[]))`\n  - `c(pk(sS[]))`\n\n#### Attacker Model\nThe protocol accounts for an active adversary capable of:\n- Accessing public keys and signatures.\n- Decrypting messages that are encrypted with known public keys.\n- Producing signatures on known messages when the corresponding secret key is accessed.\n\n#### Communication Steps\n1. **Alice's Request**:\n   - Alice signs a message that includes her identity (as represented by `host(sA)`) and her public key (`pk(sA)`) with the server's secret key `sS`.\n   - This signed message is then sent to Bob, including a signed message for Bob's key and an encrypted value using Bob's public key.\n\n2. **Bob's Response**:\n   - In response, Bob takes Alice's signed request and signs it while incorporating his identity, and responds by sending an encrypted message containing the shared secret (`secret[]`) using a symmetric key `xk`.\n\n3. **Server Authentication**:\n   - The server authenticates the identities of both Alice and Bob by validating their signatures when both `host(s1)` and `host(s2)` are acknowledged.\n\n#### Security Queries\nThe protocol checks for the confidentiality of the `secret[]`. The system queries whether `secret[]` can be compromised:\n- `query c(secret[])`: Queries about the confidentiality of the secret message.\n- `not c(sA[])`: Ensures Alice's secret key remains confidential.\n- `not c(sB[])`: Ensures Bob's secret key remains confidential.\n- `not c(sS[])`: Ensures the server's secret key remains confidential.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe protocol ensures that messages exchanged between Alice and Bob are authenticated and confidential through the use of public/private key cryptography and secure message handling. The design aims to mitigate potential vulnerabilities from an active adversary in a network setting, ensuring integrity and non-repudiation.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive overview of the protocol's mechanisms, purpose, and security properties that can guide someone in understanding how the corresponding HornType file functions within the context of the ProVerif tool."]]}, "PV-1/EKE.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Below is a detailed description of the protocol, which can serve as a basis for generating a corresponding ProVerif (pv) file.\n\n### Description of the Protocol\n\n1. **Participants:**\n   - There are two main participants in the protocol identified as Host A and Host B, each executing their own process.\n   - Each host has its own associated password which is kept private.\n\n2. **Key Generation:**\n   - Host A generates a secret key (`sEA`) and derives the corresponding public key (`EA`) through a public key function. Host B does a similar operation with its secret key.\n   \n3. **Initialization:**\n   - Host A sends its public key `EA` (encrypted with its password) to Host B after initial handshake.\n   - Host B responds by deriving the corresponding secret key from the received message and sends back its own generated secret key.\n\n4. **Challenge-Response Mechanism:**\n   - Host A sends a nonce challenge to Host B, who must respond with a nonce as well, thus proving its identity.\n   - Both hosts exchange encrypted nonces to establish mutual authentication:\n     - Host A encrypts its challenge using its derived secret key and sends it to Host B.\n     - Host B decrypts this message to validate the challenge, then creates its own nonce, encrypts it, and sends it back.\n\n5. **Resilience against Attacks:**\n   - The system is designed to prevent vulnerabilities such as replay attacks and distinguishes between genuine hosts through the exchange of dynamic nonces.\n   - The use of symmetric and public key encryption provides a layered approach to securing communications.\n\n6. **Many-to-Many Communication:**\n   - The model allows for various invocations where hosts can communicate with themselves or switch partners, establishing a complexity in interactions that adhere to the defined security properties.\n\n7. **Formal Verification:**\n   - The protocol's behaviors are represented in the ProVerif environment, and the correctness of the protocol can be queried in terms of observational equivalence regarding the secrecy of the passwords and the authenticity of the messages being exchanged.\n\n### Generation of the ProVerif Code\n\nFrom the description, a ProVerif code can be created as follows, closely aligned with the structure you've provided in the initial `pv` file.\n\n```pv\n(* Cryptographic Protocol Description *)\n\nfree c: channel.\n\ntype host.\ntype passwd.\ntype nonce.\ntype pkey.\ntype skey.\ntype key.\n\nfun nonce_to_bitstring(nonce): bitstring [data, typeConverter].\nfun pkey_to_bitstring(pkey):bitstring [data, typeConverter].\n\nfun enc(bitstring, passwd): bitstring.\nfun dec(bitstring, passwd): bitstring.\nequation forall x: bitstring, y: passwd; dec(enc(x,y),y) = x.\nequation forall x: bitstring, y: passwd; enc(dec(x,y),y) = x.\n\nfun senc(bitstring, key): bitstring.\nreduc forall x: bitstring, y: key; sdec(senc(x,y),y) = x.\n\nfun penc(key, pkey): bitstring.\nfun pk(skey): pkey.\nreduc forall x: key, y: skey; pdec(penc(x,pk(y)),y) = x.\n\nconst A, B: host.\nfree PAB, PAA, PBB: passwd [private].\n\nlet processA(hostA: host, hostX: host, P: passwd) =\n\tnew sEA: skey;\n\tlet EA = pk(sEA) in\n\tout(c, (hostA, enc(pkey_to_bitstring(EA), P)));\n\tin(c,m2: bitstring);\n\tlet R = pdec(dec(m2,P),sEA) in\n\tnew challengeA: nonce;\n\tout(c, senc(nonce_to_bitstring(challengeA), R));\n\tin(c, m4: bitstring);\n\tlet (=challengeA, challengeB: nonce) = sdec(m4, R) in\n\tout(c, senc(nonce_to_bitstring(challengeB), R)).\n\nlet processB(hostB: host, hostX: host, P: passwd) =\n\tin(c, (=hostX, m: bitstring));\n\tlet pkey_to_bitstring(EA) = dec(m, P) in\n\tnew R: key;\n\tout(c, enc(penc(R, EA), P));\n\tin(c,m3: bitstring);\n\tlet nonce_to_bitstring(challengeA) = sdec(m3, R) in\n\tnew challengeB: nonce;\n\tout(c, senc((challengeA, challengeB), R));\n\tin(c, m5: bitstring);\n\tif sdec(m5, R) = nonce_to_bitstring(challengeB) then\n\t0.\n\nprocess \n\t(!processA(A, A, PAA)) |\n\t(!processB(A, A, PAA)) |\n\t(!processA(B, B, PBB)) |\n\t(!processB(B, B, PBB)) |\n\t(!processA(A, B, PAB)) |\n\t(!processB(A, B, PAB)) |\n\t(!processA(B, A, PAB)) |\n\t(!processB(B, A, PAB)) |\n\t(phase 1;\n\tnew w: passwd;\n\tout(c, choice[w, PAB]))\n```\n\nThis generated ProVerif code captures the essence of the protocol flow as described, allowing for formal verification of its security properties using the ProVerif tool."]]}, "PV-1/needham.horn": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The protocol employs public key cryptography and encryption techniques, utilizing nonce values for freshness and preventing replay attacks.\n\n**Key Components:**\n1. **Public Key Infrastructure:** \n   - Each participant has a public/private key pair.\n   - `pk(skA[])` indicates the public key of Alice.\n   - `pk(skB[])` indicates the public key of Bob.\n\n2. **Encryption Function:** \n   - The function `encrypt(m, pk)` signifies the encryption of a message `m` using a public key `pk`.\n   - Encrypted messages can only be decrypted by the corresponding private key holder.\n\n3. **Nonce Values:**\n   - Nonce values (`Na` and `Nb`) are introduced to ensure that messages cannot be reused, providing freshness.\n   - `Nb[encrypt(Nb[encrypt(...), ...], ...)]` ensures that nonce values are included within the encryption process, contributing to the assurance of fresh messages.\n\n### Protocol Flow:\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The protocol begins with a message construction that includes the nonce values from Alice.\n   - The initial state indicates Alice generates a nonce `Na[v3,v4]` and sends it to Bob along with her public key.\n\n2. **Message Encryption:**\n   - Alice sends an encrypted message containing the nonce and an additional value `v5` to Bob: \n     \\[\n     c:encrypt((Na[v3,v4], v5, v3), pk(skA[]))\n     \\]\n   - Bob receives this message and must decrypt it using his private key.\n\n3. **Response from Bob:**\n   - Upon receiving the encrypted message, Bob responds by encrypting his own nonce `Nb` along with some additional data that includes Alice's nonce, ensuring secure communication. \n   - This response is also an encrypted message from Bob to Alice.\n  \n4. **Finalization and Verification:** \n   - Throughout the protocol, various conditions check the existence and proper use of public keys and messages.\n   - The final query checks that after all encryption operations, the expected states correspond to the conditions specified in the protocol, namely ensuring that the message flows match the encryption logic.\n\n### Security Assumptions:\n- The protocol assumes the secure handling of private keys for both parties.\n- It is built upon the soundness of the cryptographic primitives used (encryption/decryption) and the proper generation and usage of nonce values to mitigate potential replay attacks.\n\n### Queries and Reductions:\n- The protocol includes multiple reduction rules that establish the conditions under which the public keys and nonce actions hold, ensuring the integrity of the communication process.\n- The query `end:x,y` verifies that the protocol reaches a conclusion where both parties' expectations are fulfilled after negotiation.\n\n---\n\nThis description should guide you in modifying or generating the corresponding Horn file that can be run by ProVerif according to the protocol's characteristics and logic.

The protocol involves the following main components:\n\n1. **Channels and Types**:\n   - The protocol executes on a designated communication channel \\( c \\).\n   - It defines types for keys, hosts, nonces, and tags.\n\n2. **Key Management**:\n   - The protocol uses shared keys, which are managed in a key table where pairs of hosts and their respective keys are stored.\n   - There are specific keys \\( Kas \\) and \\( Kbs \\) that are created for hosts A and B, respectively, ensuring their secrecy against potential attacks.\n\n3. **Protocol Roles**:\n   - **Initiator (A)**: \n     - The initiator begins the communication by sending its identity and a target host's identity (h) to the server.\n     - Upon receiving these identities, it generates a nonce (Na) for use in the session.\n     - The initiator requests a key with the server and after receiving it, it sends messages encrypted with this key to the responder.\n     - It also handles the session secret and sends a final message containing its secret.\n\n   - **Responder (B)**: \n     - Upon being invoked, the responder listens for messages from the initiator.\n     - It decrypts the initial message to retrieve the nonce and its counterpart\u2019s identity.\n     - Then it generates its own nonce (Nb), responds with this nonce and confirms the parameters exchanged.\n     - It also sends its session secret in an encrypted form back to the initiator.\n\n   - **Server (S)**:\n     - The server processes requests for key exchanges by taking in the identities and session nonce and providing a new shared key for the communication between the initiator and responder.\n     - The server encrypts the messages to ensure confidentiality before sending them back.\n\n4. **Key Registration**:\n   - The protocol allows for dynamic key registrations to accommodate new hosts not initially predefined. Any host can send a request with its identity and key to be registered in the key table.\n\n5. **Security Assumptions**:\n   - Assumptions are made that only the two honest parties (A and B) are able to communicate the secrets without interference from adversarial parties.\n   - The protocol incorporates checks to prevent unauthorized access to the session secrets.\n\n6. **Events**:\n   - Various events regarding the start and end of communication sessions and key exchanges are defined to track the different phases of interaction.\n   - These events help in the verification of the protocol to ensure that communications are occurring as expected.\n\n7. **Verification Goals**:\n   - The protocol is verified to ensure that the session secrets for both participants are not accessible by any attacker. \n   - Additionally, it ensures that the key exchange protocol's order is maintained through the use of event queries.\n\nThis description captures the essential elements of how the Needham-Schroeder shared key protocol operates and outlines the steps involved in establishing a secure communication channel between two hosts, ensuring confidentiality and integrity through encryption and proper session management. This understanding can be utilized to re-implement the protocol in the ProVerif (pv) language for verification."]]}, "PV-1/NSLPK-agree-A-to-B.pv": {"code": [[true, "(* The code modeling key server interaction is copied from ProVerif's Needham-Schroeder examples *)\nfree c : channel.\n\nfree A : bitstring.\nfree B : bitstring.\nfree I : bitstring.\n\nfun pkey(bitstring) : bitstring.\n\ntable keys(bitstring, bitstring).\n\n(* Crypto primitives for the trusted server *)\nfun sign(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.

Below is a high-level description of the protocol, structured to facilitate understanding and potentially guide the generation of a corresponding PV file.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Overview:**\nThis protocol facilitates secure communication between two parties, denoted as Client A and Client B. It relies on a trusted key server to distribute public keys and facilitate the establishment of shared secret keys for encrypted communication. The protocol employs public key cryptography, digital signatures, and asymmetric encryption.\n\n**Participants:**\n1. **Client A** - Initiator of the communication.\n2. **Client B** - Respondent to the communication.\n3. **Key Retrieval Server** - The trusted entity that provides public keys of participants.\n4. **Key Registration Server** - Component responsible for storing and registering public keys.\n\n**Key Variables:**\n- `pk`: Public Key\n- `sk`: Secret Key\n- `Na`, `Nb`: Nonces generated by Client A and Client B respectively.\n- `I`: Identity of Client B.\n- `c`: Communication channel.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Key Registration:**\n   - Both Client A and Client B generate their secret keys (`skA` and `skB`).\n   - Public keys (`pkA` and `pkB`) are computed using a public key function (`pkey`).\n   - The public keys are registered with the server using the `key_register_server` process, which stores the mappings of identities to public keys.\n\n2. **Client A Starts Communication:**\n   - Client A begins the communication by generating a nonce (`Na`).\n   - It sends its identity (`A`) and the identity of Client B (`I`) to the key retrieval server via the channel.\n   - The key retrieval server responds with the signed public key of Client B (`pkI`), ensuring authenticity using signatures.\n\n3. **Encrypted Message Exchange:**\n   - Client A sends an encrypted message containing `Na` and its identity (`A`) to Client B. This message is encrypted with `pkI`.\n   - Client B receives the message, decrypts it to retrieve `Na` and verifies its identity.\n   - Client B generates its own nonce (`Nb`) and responds with an encrypted message that includes `Na`, its own nonce (`Nb`), and its identity (`B`), all encrypted with `pkA`.\n   - Finally, Client A receives the message containing `Nb`, decrypts it, and completes the communication by sending the designated objective message.\n\n4. **Key Retrieval Server:**\n   - The key retrieval server listens for request messages (sending requests to fetch public keys) and responds with signed public keys of requested clients.\n   - It ensures that only valid requests are handled, strengthening the integrity of key retrieval.\n\n5. **Conclusion:**\n   - The protocol ensures that two clients (A and B) can establish a secure communication channel using public/private key pairs, nonce challenges to prevent replay attacks, and signatures for authenticity.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n- **Confidentiality**: Communication is secure through encryption using public keys.\n- **Authentication**: The signatures for public keys ensure that clients are communicating with the correct parties.\n- **Integrity**: The protocol design ensures messages are not tampered with during transmission.\n\n---\n\nThis description can be used to create or modify the original PV file while still maintaining a clear understanding of the protocol's workings, participants, and security properties."]]}, "PV-1/piwoolampk.pi": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

This description can be utilized to generate a corresponding \u03c0-calculus file that can be run by the ProVerif tool.\n\n---\n\n## Description of the Woo and Lam Public-Key Authentication Protocol\n\n### Overview\nThe Woo and Lam protocol is a cryptographic authentication protocol that allows two parties, A and B, to authenticate one another using public-key cryptography. The protocol involves a trusted server, S, which helps to facilitate the authentication process.\n\n### Participants\n- **A**: The initiator of the authentication process.\n- **B**: The responder attempting to authenticate A.\n- **S**: A trusted third-party server that holds the public keys of both participants.\n\n### Key Components\n1. **Public and Secret Keys**:\n   - Each participant possesses a secret key (`skA` for A, `skB` for B, `skS` for the server S) and the corresponding public key (`pkA`, `pkB`, `pkS`) derived from those secret keys.\n  \n2. **Host Names**: \n   - Host names are used to identify the participants. For instance, `hostA` corresponds to A's public key, and `hostB` corresponds to B's public key.\n\n### Protocol Steps\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - The participants generate their secret keys and corresponding public keys. All public keys and host information are disseminated to allow for secure communication.\n\n2. **Step 1: Authentication Request**:\n   - A sends its identifier (host name) to B.\n\n3. **Step 2: Challenge**:\n   - Upon receiving A's request, B generates a nonce (a random number `n`) and sends it to A to prevent replay attacks.\n\n4. **Step 3: Authentication Response**:\n   - A responds to B with a signed message that includes A\u2019s name, B\u2019s name, and the nonce `n`. This signature is generated using A's secret key (`skA`).\n\n5. **Step 4: Relay to Server**:\n   - B sends A's identifier to the server S as a request for verification of the signature.\n\n6. **Step 5: Server Verification**:\n   - The server S checks A's signature using A\u2019s public key. Upon successful verification, S sends back a confirmation to B along with A's identifier and a signed message containing A\u2019s public key.\n\n7. **Step 6: Final Verification**:\n   - B receives the signed message from S, verifies it to confirm that it came from the server, and finally authenticates A.\n\n### Security Assumptions\n- The secret keys (skA, skB, skS) are not known to unauthorized parties.\n- Messages are signed to ensure their integrity and authenticity.\n\n### Queries\nThe protocol verifies the effectiveness of authentication events:\n- **beginBparam**: This event signifies the start of B\u2019s authentication process.\n- **beginBfull**: This event confirms the completion of the full authentication sequence between A and B.\n\n### Results\n- The expected results ensure that the authentication processes (`beginBparam` and `beginBfull`) are successfully completed according to the protocol specifications.\n\n---\n\nThis structured description highlights the key elements of the Woo and Lam public-key authentication protocol and can be adapted to create a \u03c0-calculus file for running in ProVerif. The original \u03c0 file you provided encapsulates these aspects effectively, demonstrating the processes and security measures for authentication while maintaining clarity for analysis."]]}, "PV-1/rdp.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*assumes private as protected by Solid-OIDC*)\nfree cout:channel [private] .

A public channel is also included to announce the presence of the client Name.\n\n3. **Events**:\n   - The protocol defines several events to track the communication:\n     - `clientSendName(bitstring)`: Triggered when a client sends their Name and operation.\n     - `clientReceiveResponse(bitstring)`: Triggered when a client receives a response back from the affiliate via the RDP.\n     - `orgOK(bitstring)`: Triggered when the organization receives a message from the RDP confirming receipt of a Name.\n     - `affReceivesMsg(bitstring)`: Triggered when the affiliate receives a message from the RDP.\n     - `rdpWasSuccessful(bitstring)`: Triggered once the RDP receives a successful response from the affiliate regarding the organization.\n\n### Security Goals:\n1. **Confidentiality of Client's Name**: The protocol ensures that the affiliate does not gain knowledge of any client's Name, whether valid or invalid.\n   \n   - **Queries**:\n     ```\n     query attacker(validName) .\n     query attacker(invalidName) .\n     ```\n   \n2. **Message Forwarding Integrity**: The communication between the client and the affiliate must be validated by the organization through the RDP, ensuring that the organization has seen the message before it is forwarded.\n\n   - **Query**:\n     ```\n     query nonce:bitstring; event(clientReceiveResponse(nonce)) ==> inj-event(orgOK(nonce)).\n     ```\n\n3. **Response Guarantee**: The protocol guarantees that a client will always receive a response when an operation is sent.\n\n   - **Query**:\n     ```\n     query nonce:bitstring; event(clientReceiveResponse(nonce)) ==> inj-event(clientSendName(nonce)).\n     ```\n\n### Operational Dynamics:\n1. **Client Operations**: The client generates a session nonce and sends a tuple containing their Name, requested operation, and nonce to the RDP.\n  \n2. **RDP Processing**:\n   - Receives client messages and sends them to the organization for policy verification.\n   - Forwards the results of the organization's response (if the client's Name and operation are valid) to the affiliate.\n   \n3. **Organization's Policy Check**: The organization assesses the request based on the client's Name and responds with either an OK or rejection message.\n\n4. **Affiliate Execution**: Upon receiving an approved request, the affiliate processes the operation and returns a response back through the RDP.\n\n5. **Final Response**: The RDP returns the affiliate\u2019s response back to the client.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThis protocol establishes a layered security approach through the roles of clients, proxies, organizations, and affiliates coupled with strict adherence to confidentiality, integrity, and authorization checks. Each component plays a critical role in ensuring secure message transfer while preventing unauthorized access to sensitive information. \n\nThe framework permits ProVerif to analyze and verify the protocol's security properties against the defined queries, ensuring robustness against potential attacks and unauthorized disclosures. \n\n**Next Steps**: Use the described protocol to generate a corresponding ProVerif (.pv) file as outlined above, which can be executed in the ProVerif tool for further analysis and verification."]]}, "PV-1/signedDH.pv": {"code": [[true, "(* From Proverif git examples directory *)\n\n(* Signed Diffie-Hellman\n\tA -> B : { e^n0 }skA, pkA    (n0 fresh)\n        B -> A : { e^n1 }skB         (n1 fresh)\n          A and B compute the key as k = (e^n0)^n1 = (e^n1)^n0\n        A -> B : { s }k\n\n *)\n\nfree c: channel.\n\ntype pkey.

Based on the provided ProVerif (pv) file content, I can generate a descriptive summary of the protocol, outlining its components, steps, and security objectives. This description will be useful to create a corresponding pv file.\n\n---\n\n### Description of the Signed Diffie-Hellman Protocol\n\n**Overview**:\nThe Signed Diffie-Hellman protocol enables two parties, A and B, to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. The protocol relies on the concept of Diffie-Hellman key exchange combined with digital signatures to ensure authenticity and confidentiality.\n\n**Participants**:\n- **A**: The first party who possesses a secret key \\(`skA`\\) and its corresponding public key \\(`pkA`\\).\n- **B**: The second party who possesses a secret key \\(`skB`\\) and its corresponding public key \\(`pkB`\\).\n\n**Key Generation**:\n1. Each participant \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) has their own pair of secret and public keys which are denoted as:\n   - \\( skA \\): secret key of A\n   - \\( pkA \\): public key of A\n   - \\( skB \\): secret key of B\n   - \\( pkB \\): public key of B\n\n**Protocol Steps**:\n1. **Key Exchange Initialization**:\n   - **A** generates a fresh exponent \\(n0\\) and sends the signed message containing \\( e^{n0} \\) (the result of a base value \\(g\\) raised to \\(n0\\)) along with its public key \\(pkA\\) to **B**.\n   \n2. **Receiving and Responding**:\n   - Upon receiving the message, **B** extracts the exponent by checking the signature on the message. \n   - **B** generates a fresh exponent \\(n1\\) and sends back the signed message containing \\(e^{n1}\\) to **A**.\n\n3. **Key Computation**:\n   - Both **A** and **B** compute the shared secret key using the exponents exchanged:\n     - \\( k = (e^{n0})^{n1} \\) calculated by **A**\n     - \\( k = (e^{n1})^{n0} \\) calculated by **B**\n   - This ensures that both parties derive the same shared secret key \\(k\\).\n\n4. **Message Encryption**:\n   - **A** sends a secret message \\(s\\), encrypted with the shared key \\(k\\), to **B**.\n\n**Security Objectives**:\n- The protocol ensures **confidentiality** of the secret message \\(s\\) such that even if an attacker tries to intercept the messages exchanged, they will be unable to recover \\(s\\).\n- The use of digital signatures provides **authenticity**, ensuring that the messages indeed originate from the claimed sender (i.e., preventing impersonation).\n\n**Attacker Model**:\n- An attacker can observe messages in transit but is unable to determine the secret \\(s\\) due to the encryption and the properties of the Diffie-Hellman exchange.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Signed Diffie-Hellman protocol effectively establishes a secure communication channel between two parties using key agreement and digital signing techniques. It leverages cryptographic primitives to maintain the security of the exchanged messages against potential interception by attackers.\n\n---\n\nUsing this description, you can adapt the original pv file to match any additional specifics you might want to include or further refine your implementation.

This preserves the original logic and structure of the code while providing clarity to anyone reading it."]], "logic": [[true, "The given PV file describes a cryptographic authentication protocol known as the WooLam shared-key authentication protocol. Below is a detailed description of the protocol, which can be used to create a corresponding PV file that can be run by ProVerif.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: WooLam Shared-Key Authentication Protocol (1997)\n\n**Overview**\nThe WooLam protocol is a shared-key authentication protocol that facilitates secure communication between two parties, A and B, with the involvement of a server S. The protocol allows A to authenticate itself to B while ensuring that keys remain confidential.\n\n**Key Participants**\n1. **Initiator (A)**: The party wishing to establish communication and authenticate itself.\n2. **Responder (B)**: The party that responds to the authentication request.\n3. **Server (S)**: A trusted entity that assists in key management and verification.\n\n**Key Components**\n- `Kas`: The shared key between A and the server S.\n- `Kbs`: The shared key between B and the server S.\n- `N`: A nonce (a fresh random number used only once) generated by B for the session.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n1. **Initiation**:\n   - A sends its identity to B.\n   - B responds with a fresh nonce (N) to A.\n\n2. **Message Exchange**:\n   - A constructs a message containing its identity, B's identity, and the nonce N, all encrypted using the key `Kas`.\n   - A sends the encrypted message to B via the server S.\n\n3. **Authentication by Server**:\n   - Server S receives the message and decrypts it using the key `Kbs`.\n   - It verifies the contents to ensure that the message came from A and that the nonce is valid.\n   - If the verification is successful, S sends a message back to B, containing the decrypted information.\n\n4. **Final Verification**:\n   - B decrypts the message received from S using `Kbs`.\n   - B verifies that the decrypted message matches the expected structure and values, confirming that A has successfully authenticated.\n\n**Security Assumptions**\n- The keys `Kas` and `Kbs` are unknown to any potential attacker.\n- None of the host identities (A and B) can be spoofed by the attacker.\n\n**Events**\nThe protocol defines a series of events to mark the beginning and end of parameter exchanges and sessions:\n- `beginBparam(x, y)`: Marks the start of the parameter exchange between hosts x and y.\n- `endBparam(x, y)`: Marks the completion of the parameter exchange.\n- `beginBfull(x, y, n)`: Indicates the full exchange session start, including the nonce n.\n- `endBfull(x, y, n)`: Indicates the full exchange session completion.\n\n**Queries**\nThe protocol includes queries to check that the end events logically follow the begin events, ensuring that if an exchange is completed, it was started accurately.\n\n**Process Lifecycle**\n- The protocol outlines processes for the initiator, responder, server, and for key registration, with provisions for an unbounded number of sessions.\n\n---\n\nThis description outlines the key aspects of the WooLam shared-key authentication protocol and provides a comprehensive understanding for creating or running a corresponding ProVerif file. You can now use this description to structure a new PV file or modify an existing one."]]}}
