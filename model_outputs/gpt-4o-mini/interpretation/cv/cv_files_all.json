The annotations are clearly separated, ensuring that the file remains runnable in CryptVerif."]], "logic": [[true, "Here is a description of the ElGamal encryption scheme as specified in the provided CV file. This description outlines the key properties and assumptions made in the protocol, as well as the key components of the CV file, enabling you to replicate or generate a CV file that can be executed with CryptoVerif.\n\n---\n\n### Description of the ElGamal Encryption Scheme\n\nThe ElGamal encryption scheme is based on the hardness of the Decision Diffie-Hellman (DDH) problem. The following components are defined in the scheme:\n\n**1. Parameters and Types:**\n- **Parameters:** `n` (number of executions), `q` (a security parameter).\n- **Types:**\n  - `Z`: A fixed type representing integer exponents.\n  - `G`: A fixed type representing group elements.\n\n**2. Cryptographic Assumptions:**\n- **Probability of DDH:** `pDDH` represents the probability associated with the decision version of the Diffie-Hellman problem.\n  \n**3. Functions and Constants:**\n- **Exponentiation Function (`exp`):** This function raises a generator to a given exponent.\n- **Multiplication Function (`mult`):** This function computes the multiplication of two exponents.\n- **Dot Product Function (`dot`):** A function that combines two group elements (acts like a uniform combination).\n- **Inverse Dot Function (`invdot`):** This function gives the left inverse of the `dot` operation.\n\n**4. Equivalence Statements:**\n- The scheme uses equivalence statements to claim that certain distributions in chosen sequences yield no significant difference, crucial for proving the security under the DDH assumption.\n\n**5. Security Definition:**\n- The security of the encryption scheme is guaranteed by establishing that for any polynomial `n`, the probability distributions of certain groups of outputs are indistinguishable.\n\n**6. Choosing between messages:**\n- The `choose` function concisely describes how a message is selected based on a boolean condition, enabling the selection of one of two messages `m0` or `m1`.\n\n**7. Process Structure:**\n- **Encryption Process (`processE`):** \n  - The process starts by receiving two messages and a boolean flag to choose between them. \n  - It computes the necessary values, including the public key (`beta`) and the encryption of the message, then outputs the result over a designated channel.\n\n- **Main Process:**\n  - The main process begins by generating a secret exponent and computing the public key, followed by the initiation of the encryption sub-process.\n\n**8. Channels:**\n- Several communication channels are defined:\n  - `cPK`: The channel for outputting the public key.\n  - `cE`: The channel for inputting messages for encryption.\n  - `cEret`: The channel for outputting the encrypted message.\n  - `start`: The channel which initiates the encryption process.\n\n**9. Queries:**\n- A secrecy query (`secret b`) is invoked, indicating that the specified boolean flag `b` is secret.\n\n---\n\n### Generating a Corresponding CV File\n\nUsing the outlined components and structure, you can recreate the CV file to run in CryptoVerif as follows:\n\n```cv\n(** ElGamal encryption scheme **)\n\n(** An encryption scheme is shown to be SS\n    under the DDH assumption.\n    See Section 3, \"Sequences of Games\", Victor Shoup. **)\n\nparam n, q.\n\ntype Z [fixed].\n\ntype G [fixed].\n\nproba pDDH.\n\nfun exp(G,Z): G.\nconst gamma:G.\n\n(* gamma is a uniform generator *)\n\nequiv \n    () n -> new x:Z; exp(gamma,x) [all]\n<=(0)=>\n    () n -> new y:G; y.\n\nfun mult(Z,Z): Z.\nequation commut(mult).\n\nforall a:G, x:Z, y:Z;\n  exp(exp(a,x), y) = exp(a, mult(x,y)).\n\nfun dot(G,G): G.\n\nequiv \n    (y:G) n -> new x:G; dot(x,y) [all]\n<=(0)=>\n    (y:G) n -> new x:G; x.\n\nfun invdot(G,G): G.\n\nforall a:G, b:G;\n  invdot(a, dot(a,b)) = b.\n\n(* the DDH assumption *) \n\nequiv\n    !n new x:Z; new y:Z; (\n      () -> exp(gamma,x), \n      () -> exp(gamma,y), \n      () -> exp(gamma, mult(x,y)) ) \n<=(pDDH(time) * n)=>\n    !n new x:Z; new y:Z; new z:Z; (\n      () -> exp(gamma,x), \n      () -> exp(gamma,y), \n      () -> exp(gamma, z) ).\n\nfun choose(bool,G,G): G.\n\nforall x:bool, y:G, z:G;\n  (x && choose(x,y,z) = y) || (not(x) && choose(x,y,z) = z).\n\n(* query *)\nquery secret b.\n\nchannel cPK, cE, cEret, start.\n\nlet processE = \n    in(cE, (m0:G, m1:G));\n    new b:bool;\n    let m = choose(b,m1,m0) in\n    new y:Z;\n    let beta = exp(gamma,y) in\n    let delta = exp(alpha,y) in\n    let zeta = dot(delta, m) in\n    out(cEret, (beta,zeta)).\n\nprocess\n  !q\n  in(start, ());\n  new x:Z;\n  let alpha = exp(gamma,x) in\n  out(cPK, alpha); \n  processE\n\n(* EXPECTED\nAll queries proved.\n0.020s (user 0.020s + system 0.000s), max rss 16560K\nEND *)\n```\n\nThis structure ensures that the ElGamal encryption scheme is appropriately represented with clearly defined procedures and security considerations, enabling you to run it through the CryptoVerif tool for verification of security properties."]]}, "CV-1/BogdanDennis2.ocv": {"code": [[true, "param n_f, n_x, nK, nF, nx.\n\n(* set interactiveMode = true. *)\n\ntype pkey [bounded].

Below is a high-level description of the protocol represented in the OCV file.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Overview\nThe protocol involves two main parties: a key generator and an adversary. The protocol supports generating public and secret keys from a seed and includes a function for encrypting and decrypting messages. The core of the protocol uses a boolean function for some verification.\n\n#### Key Generation\n- The protocol defines two types of keys: **public keys (pkey)** and **secret keys (skey)**. \n- The keys are generated using a seed through the following functions:\n  - `pkgen(seed)` generates a public key.\n  - `skgen(seed)` generates a secret key.\n\n#### Functions\n- The protocol uses a function `f(pkey, D)` to operate on the public keys and data, and an inverse function `invf(skey, D)` to decrypt or validate the data. \n- Additionally, there is a function `B(D)` that represents a boolean operation on the data.\n\n#### Randomness and Equivocation\n- Random values are generated using the `seed` type across various sections of the protocol. These values are used in multiple nested iterations, suggesting multiple rounds of processing.\n\n- The **equivalence** statements in the protocol define the relationship between the outputs of the real process and those when an idealized process or oracle is invoked. Such equivalences are crucial for proving security properties.\n\n#### Security Property\n- The protocol has a query for the secrecy of a boolean value denoted as `b`. The outputs of `processRealBob` depend on `b`, and the structure indicates ties to notions of indistinguishability in cryptographic proofs.\n\n#### Process Logic\n- The function `processRealBob` handles the overall logic for determining how data is processed based on the boolean value `b`.\n- Depending on whether `b` is true or false, it will choose different paths for processing the encrypted values (y and y\u2019). The output includes public key, data, verification states, and boolean outcomes.\n\n#### Final Equivalence and Expected Results\n- The protocol concludes with several equivalence checks to validate that the outputs (which could identify whether `b` can be computed from public information) do not leak information regarding the secret value.\n\n- The expected result involves checks that may fail to prove the secrecy of `b`, signaling that the adversary might have access to information that could reveal the value of `b` based on the processing outcomes.\n\n---\n\n### Corresponding OCV File Generation\n\nWith the above description, you can regenerate or build a corresponding OCV file that captures all the essential components of this protocol by adapting the provided structure. Make sure to preserve the functional and logical relationships defined above, focusing on the correspondence between randomness, key generation, public-verifiable processes, and the security equivalences as laid out in the original code.\n\nThe functionality of your generated OCV file should closely match the interactions, data flows, and security assertions encapsulated in the initial example you've provided.

Below is a detailed description of the protocol that captures its essence and defines the necessary components to allow for the generation of a corresponding OCV file.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\nThe protocol described in the OCV file consists of the following key components:\n\n1. **Parameters:**\n   - `N`: The maximum number of iterations for processes A and B.\n   - `N2`: Represents possible additional constraints or configurations (not explicitly utilized in the given example).\n   - `N3`: Represents additional parameters related to security properties or limits (not explicitly utilized in the given example).\n\n2. **Types:**\n   - `mkey`: A type representing the main key used for encryption, bounded to facilitate security guarantees.\n   - `mkeyseed`: A type for the initial key seed, fixed in length.\n   - `key`: Represents the primary symmetric encryption key, large and fixed in size.\n   - `keyseed`: A fixed-size seed for deriving encryption keys.\n   - `seed`: A fixed-size seed used in the encryption process.\n\n3. **Cryptographic Functions:**\n   - `keyToBitstring`: Converts a key to its bitstring representation, with the property of composability.\n\n4. **Encryption Mode:**\n   - The protocol employs a **Shared-key encryption** scheme, specifically a **CPA (Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure** stream cipher, defined via the `IND_CCA2_sym_enc` function. This function ensures that the encryption mechanism is resistant to chosen-ciphertext attacks.\n\n5. **Constants and Functions:**\n   - The constant `Zkey` is defined as a bitstring of zeros. The function `Z` is constructed such that given a key, it produces a corresponding zero-filled bitstring of the same length.\n\n6. **Queries:**\n   - The protocol queries `secret1 k2` and `secret1 k3`, indicating a request to test the secrecy of keys `k2` and `k3`, respectively. Additionally, there are general secrecy queries for both keys.\n\n7. **Processes:**\n   - **Process A (`processA`)**: This process is responsible for generating an encryption with a randomly selected key (`k2`) and a seed (`s1`). Upon execution, it encrypts data using the `enc` function and returns the encrypted output `ea1`.\n   - **Process B (`processB`)**: This process receives the encrypted data `ea` from Process A. It attempts to decrypt the data using a key (`k3`) and the associated decryption function `dec`.\n\n8. **Overall Process Execution:**\n   - The main process `Ostart()` initiates the protocol by creating a random key seed (`rKab`) and deriving the shared key (`Kab`) using a key generation function (`kgen`). The main process runs multiple instances of `processA` and `processB`, dictated by the parameters `N` and allows for parallel execution.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\nThe agent is to ascertain whether the key `k3` maintains confidentiality throughout the protocol's execution. The `EXPECT` section suggests that proving the secrecy of key `k3` might not be possible under the given conditions, reflecting potential vulnerabilities in the communication process or the encryption mechanism being utilized.\n\n### Summary\nThe OCV protocol file encapsulates a communication exchange where two parties utilize a symmetric key for encryption and decryption within a framework designed for analysis under cryptographic assumptions. The nature of the parameters, types, processes, and expected outcomes articulates a typical setup for testing the security properties of cryptographic protocols through tools like CryptoVerif.\n\nThis description provides the necessary outline from which the OCV file can be reproduced or modified according to specific needs while retaining its functional integrity."]]}, "CV-1/testPRP.cv": {"code": [[true, "(* Trivial running example for conference paper. *)\n\nparam N.

The encryption process takes a key and keyseed to create a secure ciphertext.\n2. **Message Authentication:** A secure MAC is generated using the `expand SUF_CMA_mac`, which ensures that the encrypted message is authentic. This process uses a MAC key and a MAC key seed.\n\n**Process Descriptions:**\n- **Process A (Alice):**\n  - Receives a message and authenticating code via channel `cA`.\n  - Generates a new encryption key (k2), encrypts the message with that key, and computes the MAC.\n  - Sends the encrypted message and the MAC over the channel to process B, and signifies the beginning of the communication with an event.\n\n- **Process B (Bob):**\n  - Waits for the encrypted message and MAC from Alice via channel `cB`.\n  - Checks the integrity of the received message using the MAC. If the check passes, it decrypts the message to obtain the shared key (k3), marking the end of the communication.\n\n**Message Flow:**\n1. **Initialization:** The protocol begins with both parties initializing their key seeds and generating the shared encryption key (Kab) and MAC key (mKab).\n2. **Communication:**\n   - Alice starts by encrypting a message and sending it with its MAC.\n   - Bob verifies the MAC before decrypting the message.\n\n**Security Queries:**\n- The protocol includes queries that explore the secrecy of generated keys (`k2`, `k3`) and ensures that aspects of secrecy are verified and checked throughout the process.\n\n**Expected Results:**\n- The protocol aims to secure the shared key against potential eavesdroppers. The expected result concludes that the system could not prove the secrecy of `k3`, illustrating a potential security vulnerability in the design.\n\n--- \n\nThis structured description captures the essence of the protocol and pairs well with the provided CV file to ensure coherent usage within CryptVerif.

This summary serves as a basis for generating a corresponding CV file.\n\n---\n\n## Protocol Description\n\n### Overview\nThis protocol simulates a client-server interaction involving secure message exchange using cryptographic techniques. The communications are secured using unforgeable MACs (Message Authentication Codes) and IND-CCA2 (adaptive chosen ciphertext attack) secure symmetric encryption. The protocol aims at ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged messages through key generation, encryption, and decryption processes.\n\n### Parameters\n- **N**: The number of interactions or sessions.\n\n### Channels\n- **c1 to c4**: Channels for sending and receiving encrypted messages between client and server.\n- **start**: Initiation channel for process execution.\n- **finish**: Completion channel indicating the end of the protocol run.\n\n### Types\n- **payload**: Defines the format of messages exchanged.\n- **mkeyseed/mkey**: Types for MAC key generation and sizes.\n- **keyseed/key/seed**: Types for managing keys and random seeds used in encryption.\n\n### Cryptographic Primitives\n1. **MACs**: The protocol utilizes unforgeable MACs which guarantee message authenticity.\n2. **IND-CCA2 Encryption**: The protocol ensures confidentiality of messages against active adversaries. It employs encryption mechanisms that are secure under chosen ciphertext attacks.\n\n### Functions\n- **payload2bs**: Converts payload to a bitstring for transmission.\n- **key2bs/bs2key**: Functionality to convert keys to and from bitstrings ensuring congruence in key forms.\n- **concat1/parse1/parse2**: Functions for combining and extracting information from bitstrings.\n\n### Events\n1. **client_begin(bitstring)**: Marks the start of a client request.\n2. **client_accept(bitstring, bitstring)**: Indicates the client has received a response from the server.\n3. **server_reply(bitstring, bitstring)**: Marks the server's reply to the client's request.\n\n### Process\n1. **Client Process (A)**:\n   - Initiates communication by generating a request payload.\n   - Generates a session key (kS) and encrypts the combined request and key.\n   - Sends the encrypted request to the server and waits for a response.\n\n2. **Server Process (B)**:\n   - Listens for requests and decrypts the incoming messages.\n   - Processes the request to generate a response payload.\n   - Encrypts the response using a session key derived from the original message and sends it back to the client.\n\n### Security Queries\nThe protocol includes queries to confirm the authenticity of interactions. Specifically:\n- It queries the system to ensure that if an event indicating a client acceptance (`client_accept`) occurs, it must be followed by a server reply (`server_reply`), thereby ensuring coherence in interactions.\n\n### Expected Output \nThe expected output indicates that, under certain conditions, the system could not prove the required event relationships, highlighting areas for potential improvement or further analysis of the protocol\u2019s security properties. The performance metrics indicate how efficiently the analysis was handled.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: The CV file provided defines functions, types, events, and processes, ensuring rigorous adherence to formal verification protocols, targeted to use within the CryptoVerif environment for validation and analysis of cryptographic protocol security. The protocol can be executed and analyzed further to assess its robustness and vulnerabilities."]]}, "CV-1/Hanatani1.cv": {"code": [[true, "(* DH key Exchange *)\n\nproof {\ncrypto PCDH2 x\n}\n\nparam nK, na, nb, n0, n1, n2, n3, qS, nT.\n\ntype modp [large,fixed].    \ntype typeg [large,fixed].   \ntype modq [large,fixed].    \ntype R [large,fixed].       \ntype seed [large,fixed].    \n\n(* Adding notation for the properties of types *)\n(* modp is a large-fixed type representing a prime modulus *)\n(* typeg is a large-fixed type representing a group generator *)\n(* modq is a large-fixed type representing the order of the group *)\n(* R represents a generic type in the protocol *)\n(* seed represents the random seed used in key generation *)\n\nproba PCDH1.\nproba PCDH2.\nproba PCDH3.\nproba PCDH4.\nconst mark:bitstring.\n\n(* CDH Group *)\nfun pkgen1(seed):modp.

This description summarizes the main components and may be expanded or modified based on specific requirements for clarity or detail.\n\n---\n\n## Description of the DH Key Exchange Protocol\n\n### Overview\nThe protocol implements a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange mechanism to establish shared secrets between two parties. It is designed based on the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption within a secure cryptographic framework.\n\n### Cryptographic Functions\n- **Key Generation Functions**:\n  - `pkgen1(seed)`: Generates a public key component modulo a large prime \\( p \\).\n  - `pkgen2(seed)`: Produces a generator \\( g \\) of a cyclic group.\n  - `pkgen3(seed)`: Outputs the order \\( q \\) of the generator \\( g \\).\n  \n- **Function Definitions**:\n  - `f(p, g, q, a)`: Computes \\( g^a \\mod p \\) to derive the DH shared key.\n  - `f'`: Similar to `f`, but distinct to ensure security between the generated keys.\n\n### Protocol Steps\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - A random seed \\( r \\) is generated and used for key generation.\n   - The public keys \\( pk1, pk2, and pk3 \\) are derived using the functions \\( pkgen1, pkgen2, \\) and \\( pkgen3 \\) respectively.\n\n2. **Exchange of Public Keys**:\n   - The public keys are sent to the corresponding parties over a secure channel.\n\n3. **Private Calculations**:\n   - Each party generates a private key (secret exponent).\n   - The secret shared key is computed using the received public key and the generated private key.\n\n### Security Model\n- **Assumptions**: The security of the protocol relies on the hardness of the CDH problem: Given \\( g^a \\) and \\( g^b \\), it is computationally infeasible to derive \\( g^{ab} \\).\n  \n- **Attack model**: \n  - This protocol is vulnerable to an unknown key-sharing attack, where an attacker can intercept messages exchanged but cannot modify them. If the attacker can calculate the shared secret key, they may pose a threat to the integrity and confidentiality of the exchange.\n\n### Adversarial Queries\n- An event labeled `bad` tracks when an adversary successfully computes the shared key. \n- The protocol subscribes to specific conditions which, if violated, lead to the termination of the process.\n\n### Channels\n- Multiple channels \\( c0 \\) through \\( c7 \\) are established for the communication of public keys and the generated shared keys.\n\n### Expected Behavior\n- The protocol aims to guarantee that under no circumstances should the event `bad` succeed, ensuring the robustness of the key exchange against potential attacks.\n\n### Final Notes\nThe Cryptoverif tool is utilized to verify the correctness of the protocol, particularly focusing on establishing a secure key without revealing it to potential adversaries.\n\n---\n\nUsing this description, relevant code and components can be developed or modified in further iterations of the cryptographic protocol, ensuring a clear understanding of its structure and intended security properties."]]}, "CV-1/Eugen-pwd-auth.cv": {"code": [[true, "proof {\ncrypto Dbinsert;\nshow_game\n}\n\ntype mkey.

The protocol aims to demonstrate secure behaviors when handling and retrieving passwords, particularly in maintaining the confidentiality of password entries and ensuring that events indicating users\u2019 actions (like sending passwords) are handled securely.\n\n**Key Components:**\n\n1. **Types:**\n   - **mkey**: Represents the type for keys associated with password entries.\n   - **guid**: A globally unique identifier fixed in length, used to uniquely identify each database instance.\n   - **Dbdb**: Represents the type for the database which holds password entries.\n   - **unit**: A type representing unit, often used for processes where no actual value is needed.\n\n2. **Constants:**\n   - **dummy**: A placeholder value of type `bitstring`, used in the protocol to signify an empty or baseline state.\n\n3. **Channels:**\n   - **c**: The communication channel used for sending messages between different components of the protocol.\n\n4. **Database Functions:**\n   - **newdb(guid)**: Initializes a new password database with a given `guid`.\n   - **dbinsert(db, key, value)**: Inserts a key-value pair into the specified database.\n   - **select(db, key)**: Retrieves a value associated with a specified key from the database, returning an option type (either Some(value) or None).\n\n5. **Password Entry Functions:**\n   - **PwdPwEntry(mkey)**: Generates a password entry for a given user key.\n   - **PwdLeakedPwEntry(mkey)**: Generates a possibly leaked password entry for a given user key.\n\n6. **Events:**\n   - **PwdSend(bitstring, bitstring)**: An event indicating that a password is sent.\n   - **PwdSendLeak(bitstring, bitstring)**: An event indicating that a leaked password is sent.\n   - **PwdAccept(bitstring, bitstring)**: An event triggered when a password is accepted.\n   - **PwdPwLeak(bitstring)**: An event indicating that a password entry has leaked.\n   - **PwdSkLeak(bitstring)**: An event indicating that a secret key has leaked (though its specific use isn\u2019t detailed in the provided file).\n\n**Security Goals:**\nThe protocol aims to maintain a security property that states:\n- If a user has an accepted password (`PwdAccept(a,m)`), then there should exist an event where this password was originally sent (`PwdSend(a,m)`).\n\n**Processes:**\nThe main process of the protocol involves:\n- Receiving inputs through the communication channel.\n- Initializing a new password database specific for the session or user.\n- Handling multiple types of interactions with the database:\n  - Inserting new password entries.\n  - Managing and querying leaked password entries.\n  - Responding to events indicating success or failure in retrieving stored password values.\n- Effectively managing both stored valid passwords and potentially leaked passwords while aiming for non-leakage of the actual password used by the users.\n\n**Expected Outcome:**\nThe protocol is designed with specific checks in place to ensure that events relating to password sending and acceptance are correctly linked. The proof process aims to verify that it is not possible for a user to have an accepted password without having first sent it securely.\n\n---\n\nYou can use this description to create a corresponding CV file for verification in the Cryptoverif tool.

The description outlines the context, components, and mechanisms employed in the protocol to facilitate cryptographic operations, primarily focusing on the Public-Key Kerberos 5 mechanism with key usability aspects.\n\n---\n\n## Protocol Description: Public-Key Kerberos 5 with PKINIT in Public Key Mode\n\n### Overview\nThis protocol implements the Public-Key Kerberos 5 authentication system, specifically focusing on the PKINIT extension in public key mode as defined in RFC 4556. It involves three main rounds of communication between a client, a ticket-granting service (TGS), and a server. The protocol is designed to support encryption and authentication while ensuring that the key usability of the session keys generated remains intact after the client completes its session.\n\n### Components\n1. **Participants:**\n   - **Client (C)**: Initiates the authentication request and requests service tickets.\n   - **Ticket-Granting Service (TGS)**: Provides tickets for clients to access various servers.\n   - **Server (S)**: Provides services to the client upon successful authentication via tickets.\n\n2. **Keys:**\n   - **Public Key (pkey)**: The public key used for encryption.\n   - **Private Key (skey)**: The corresponding private key, securely held by the owner.\n   - **Session Keys (kas)**: Symmetric keys used for encrypting communication between the client and the server.\n\n3. **Nonces and Timestamps:**\n   - **Nonces**: Randomly generated values used to prevent replay attacks.\n   - **Timestamps**: Measure the timing of requests to ensure freshness and avoid replay exploits.\n\n### Security Goals\n- **Secrecy**: The confidentiality of messages exchanged in the protocol (e.g., the message `b1`).\n- **Authenticity**: Ensure that participants are genuine and that messages have not been tampered with.\n- **Key Usability**: Assess whether the session keys continue to exhibit IND-CCA2 security even after their initial usage.\n\n### Cryptographic Primitives\n1. **Public-Key Encryption (IND-CCA2 Security Model)**: Ensures that data encrypted with a public key cannot be decrypted without the corresponding private key. The protocol expands security checks for this model.\n   \n2. **Signatures (UF-CMA Security)**: Guarantees that a message can be verified as authentic and unaltered. The protocol includes signature verification to bolster authenticity.\n\n3. **Symmetric Encryption (IND-CPA and INT-CTXT)**: Utilizes shared keys for secure communication, providing additional encryption security through symmetric methods.\n\n### Message Construction\nThe protocol defines multiple message concatenation functions to create structured messages during various phases of interaction between the client, TGS, and server. Key message construction techniques include:\n- Padding and concatenation functions that ensure the correct formatting and structure of messages.\n- Functions to derive keys from existing keys and create valid message representations.\n\n### Encryption and Decryption Mechanisms\nThe protocol implements both encryption and decryption oracles:\n- **Encryption Oracle** (`processOE`): Handles incoming messages, applies conditional encryption, and outputs encrypted messages to preserve confidentiality.\n- **Decryption Oracle** (`processOD`): Manages incoming encrypted messages and attempts to decrypt them, providing output based on successful decryption attempts.\n\n### Global Properties\nThe protocol includes properties defined for computational security measures such as collision resistance for hash functions used within the protocol. It also establishes constraints to ensure that messages constructed are distinct and cannot be forged.\n\n### Final Protocol Operations\nThe protocol initiates a process upon receiving a start signal. During execution, it generates long-term keys, manages the encryption and decryption processes via defined channels, and continuously checks key usability by evaluating the computability and security of session keys against potential attacks.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe protocol adheres to established cryptographic principles for secure authentication and communication, utilizing a robust framework of encryption, signing, and message integrity checks to maintain secure interactions among clients, TGS, and servers within the Public-Key Kerberos 5 structure. The expected outcome of testing the secrecy and usability of the generated keys showcases a commitment to maintaining security even post-session completion.\n\n---\n\nThis description encapsulates the functionality and structure of the provided CV file, allowing for the creation of an equivalent CV script for security verification in the CryptoVerif tool."]]}, "CV-1/otestINDCPA.ocv": {"code": [[true, "(* Trivial running example for conference paper. *)\n\n(* Parameters at play *)\nparam N.

It includes the functionalities of key generation, encryption, and message authentication, tailored to provide confidentiality and integrity for messages exchanged between two parties, referred to as processes A and B.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **N, N2, N3**: These parameters are used to define bounds and controls within the protocol, influencing the number of interactions or iterations in the processes.\n\n#### Types\n- **mkey**: The type representing the message keys used in message authentication.\n- **mkeyseed**: The seed used for generating message keys which is fixed in size.\n- **key**: The type representing the session keys used for encryption, also fixed in size.\n- **keyseed**: A fixed-size seed utilized for generating encryption keys.\n- **seed**: A fixed-size variable used in the encryption process.\n- **macs**: The type representing message authentication codes, bounded in size.\n\n#### Functions\n- **keyToBitstring**: A function that converts keys into bitstrings suitable for encryption and other cryptographic operations.\n\n#### Cryptographic Mechanisms\n1. **Encryption**:\n   - The protocol employs an IND-CPA secure symmetric encryption scheme. This means it is designed to be secure against chosen plaintext attacks, utilizing a key generation function (`kgen`), an encryption function (`enc`), and a decryption function (`dec`).\n   - The encryption function is applied within process A when a random key and seed are generated, with the encrypted result labeled as `ea1`.\n\n2. **Message Authentication**:\n   - A universal forgery secure message authentication code (MAC) scheme is utilized, which involves generating a MAC using a key generation function (`mkgen`) and verifying it with a verification function (`check`).\n   - The output of this MAC is checked in process B to ensure the integrity of the received message.\n\n#### Querying Secrets\n- The protocol makes use of queries to test the secrecy of the session keys `k2` and `k3`. These queries help in analyzing whether the keys remain confidential amidst potential attacks.\n\n#### Processes\n- **Process A**:\n  - This process is responsible for generating a random encryption key `k2`, a random seed, and uses these to encrypt a message, subsequently generating and storing the corresponding MAC for the encrypted message.\n  \n- **Process B**:\n  - This process takes an encrypted message (`ea`) and its corresponding MAC (`ma`). It verifies the MAC before attempting to decrypt the message. If successful, it retrieves the original plaintext message.\n\n- **Main Process**:\n  - The main process begins by generating a key for encryption and a key for MAC generation, and then orchestrates multiple instances of processes A and B, ensuring they operate in parallel up to the bounds determined by parameter N.\n\n### Security Expectations\nThe protocol is intrinsically designed to maintain security properties, such as the confidentiality of the session keys and the integrity of the messages. However, specific queries might reveal potential vulnerabilities in maintaining the secrecy of the session keys, particularly `k3`, as indicated in the protocol's expected outcome.\n\nIn conclusion, this protocol provides a foundational model for cryptographic operations involving key management, encryption, and message integrity checks, and serves as a simple example for further exploration and analysis using the Cryptoverif tool.\n\n---\n\nThis description can be synthesized back into an OCV file format suitable for analysis in Cryptoverif, following the structurally defined components and processes outlined."]]}, "CV-1/testSUFCMAmac.cv": {"code": [[true, "(* Trivial running example for conference paper. *)\n\nparam N.\nparam N2.\nparam N3.\n\ntype mkey [bounded].\ntype mkeyseed [fixed].\ntype key [fixed].\ntype keyseed [fixed].\ntype seed [fixed].\ntype macs [bounded].\n\nfun keyToBitstring(key):bitstring [compos].\n\n(* Shared-key encryption (CPA Stream cipher) *)\n\nproba Penc.\n\nexpand IND_CPA_sym_enc(keyseed, key, bitstring, bitstring, seed, kgen, enc, dec, injbot, Z, Penc).\n\n(* The function Z returns for each bitstring, a bitstring\n   of the same length, consisting only of zeroes. *)\nconst Zkey:bitstring.\nforall y:key; \n\tZ(keyToBitstring(y)) = Zkey.\n\n(* Mac *)\n\nproba Pmac.\n\nexpand SUF_CMA_mac(mkeyseed, mkey, bitstring, macs, mkgen, mac, check, Pmac).\n\n(* Notation for MAC correctness *)\n(* This property states that if a valid MAC is generated for a message, *)\n(* then it can be successfully validated with the same secret key. *)\nforall m:bitstring, mac:macs;\n    mac = mac(m, mKab) ==> check(m, mKab, mac) = true.\n\n(* Queries *)\n\nquery secret1 k2.\nquery secret1 k3.\n\nquery secret k2.\nquery secret k3.\n\nevent endB(bitstring, macs).\nevent beginA(bitstring, macs).\n\nquery x:bitstring, y:macs, y':macs; event endB(x,y) ==> beginA(x,y).\n\nchannel cA, cB, start, c.\n\nlet processA = \n\tin(cA, ());\n\tnew k2 : key;\n\tnew s1 : seed;\n\tlet ea1 = enc(keyToBitstring(k2), Kab, s1) in\n\tlet t1 = mac(ea1, mKab) in\n\tevent beginA(ea1, t1);\n\tout(cA, (ea1, t1)).\n\nlet processB =\n\tin(cB, (ea:bitstring, ma:macs));\n\tif check(ea, mKab, ma) then\n\tlet injbot(keyToBitstring(k3:key)) = dec(ea, Kab) in\n\tevent endB(ea, ma);\n\tout(cB, ()).\n\nprocess \n\tin(start, ());\n\tnew rKab: keyseed;\n\tlet Kab = kgen(rKab) in\n\tnew rmKab: mkeyseed;\n\tlet mKab = mkgen(rmKab) in\n\tout(c, ());\n\t((!

Below is a detailed description of the protocol based on the provided CV file content. This description outlines the main components, functionality, and the purpose of the protocol, which can be used to generate an equivalent CV file for use with CryptoVerif.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Title:** Secure Key Exchange and Message Authentication Protocol\n\n**Overview:**\nThe protocol presented is a secure key exchange and message authentication system that uses symmetric key encryption and MAC (Message Authentication Code) to ensure confidentiality and integrity of messages exchanged between two parties, Alice and Bob (denoted as processA and processB respectively).\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `N`: Defines the upper bound on the number of processes that can run concurrently.\n- `N2`, `N3`: Additional parameters for the bounded types that represent keys and message keys.\n\n**Types:**\n- `mkey`: Represents message keys which are bounded in number.\n- `mkeyseed`: Fixed-size seed for generating message keys.\n- `key`: A fixed-size key used for encryption.\n- `keyseed`: Fixed-size seed for generating keys.\n- `seed`: Fixed-size value utilized during the encryption process.\n- `macs`: Represents message authentication codes which are bounded in number.\n\n**Functions:**\n- `keyToBitstring(key)`: A function that converts the key into a bitstring format for further processing.\n\n**Security Concepts:**\n1. **Shared-Key Encryption**: The protocol employs a CPA (Chosen Plaintext Attack) secure stream cipher encryption mechanism. The security of this encryption scheme is demonstrated by expanding the security definition `IND_CPA_sym_enc`, which ensures that no adversary can distinguish between the encryption of two plaintexts.\n\n2. **MAC**: To ensure the integrity and authenticity of messages, the protocol utilizes a secure MAC function (`SUF_CMA_mac`). This construction is shown to satisfy the security requirement that an adversary cannot forge valid MACs for arbitrary messages.\n\n**Queries:**\nThe protocol defines queries to retrieve session keys (k2 and k3) which are distinct for each protocol run. The secrecy of these keys is defined through the queries to the `secret` which demonstrates their confidentiality from adversaries.\n\n**Events:**\n- `endB`: This event is triggered when Bob successfully receives and verifies a message from Alice using the MAC.\n- `beginA`: This event indicates that Alice has sent a message along with its MAC to Bob.\n\n**Processes:**\n- **Process A (Alice)**: \n  - Waits for a message from the communication channel (`cA`), generates a unique session key (`k2`) and a seed (`s1`).\n  - It encrypts the message using the session key and the seed, generates a MAC for the encrypted message, then sends both the ciphertext and MAC to Bob through the channel.\n\n- **Process B (Bob)**:\n  - Waits to receive a message from Alice. Upon receiving the ciphertext and MAC, it checks the authenticity of the message using a MAC verification function.\n  - If the verification is successful, Bob decrypts the message and triggers the `endB` event.\n\n- **Main Process**: \n  - Starts the protocol by initializing key and MAC seeds and coordinating the execution of processes A and B.\n\n**Expected Result:**\nThe protocol setup aims to prove the secrecy of the key `k3`. However, in the provided output, it indicates that it could not prove the secrecy of `k3`, suggesting potential vulnerabilities or areas for further exploration within the protocol.\n\n---\n\nThis description captures the essential elements of the protocol and the cryptographic concepts employed in it.

The protocol includes nonce generation and ensures that the messages exchanged between the client and server are safeguarded against replay attacks through the use of unique session identifiers (nonces).\n\n### Parameters:\n- `NU`: Maximum number of users that can be handled by the client.\n- `NS`: Maximum number of sessions that can be established.\n- `NP`: Maximum number of password attempts before termination.\n\n### Types:\n- `G`: Represents group elements (fixed and large).\n- `nonce`: Unique session identifiers (fixed and large).\n- `thash`: Output of the hash function (fixed and large).\n- `host`: Represents entities in the system (bounded).\n\n### Cryptographic Functions:\n- `hash(G, nonce)`: A hash function that takes a group element and a nonce. It is modeled as a random oracle and is assumed to produce unique hash values for unique input pairs. It has a secrecy property where previously used inputs should not yield the same hash output.\n\n### Channels:\n- Communication channels are established for messages to exchange data between the client and the server (`c1` to `c10`, `c20`, etc.).\n\n### Events:\n- `event termS`: An event indicating that the session should terminate, triggered by the server under specific conditions related to the successful authentication of the client.\n\n### Client Process (`processU`):\n1. The client waits for an incoming message on channel `c1` to start the authentication process.\n2. A new group element `X` is generated, which represents a public parameter shared with the server.\n3. It sends `X` to the server on channel `c2`.\n4. The client waits for a confirmation from the server on channel `c5`, receiving `Ystar_u`, which is generated by the server.\n5. The client computes the hash of `Ystar_u` combined with a password (`pw`) to derive `Y_u` and sends a message on channel `c6` to indicate readiness.\n\n### Server Process (`processS`):\n1. The server waits for a message on `c3` to receive a connection from the client.\n2. It obtains `X_s`, the group element sent by the client.\n3. The server generates a new group element `Ystar` and computes its corresponding hash value `Y`.\n4. It sends `Ystar` back to the client on channel `c4`.\n5. The server waits for a confirmation from the client on channel `c7` and subsequently checks existing sessions to verify the correctness of the provided values. If successful, it triggers the termination event `termS`.\n\n### Overall Process:\nThe overall process initializes upon a start signal and generates a nonce (`pw`) to be used for secure communications. The simultaneous operations of the client and server are orchestrated through the defined channels, while the hash oracle is brought into play for hashing operations.\n\n### Expected Outcome:\nThe protocol aims to establish secure authentication between the client and server. The ultimate goal is to confirm that under the defined conditions, the termination event `termS` cannot be falsely triggered, leading to the expected outcome of security against replay or unauthorized access.\n\n---\n\nThis description captures crucial elements of the protocol, such as its structure, parameters, processes, and the involved cryptographic operations.

Here is a structured description of the given Hashed ElGamal encryption scheme:\n\n---\n\n### Description of the Hashed ElGamal Encryption Scheme\n\n#### Overview\nThe Hashed ElGamal encryption scheme presented here operates in the random oracle model and is shown to be secure against chosen plaintext attacks (CPA) under the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumption.\n\n#### Parameters\n- **n**: A security parameter defining the input size.\n- **q**: A parameter related to the complexity of the security reductions.\n- **nH**: The number of random oracle queries allowed.\n- **nCDH, nCDH'**: Parameters pertaining to the computational complexity for the CDH assumption.\n\n#### Types\n- **Z [fixed]**: The type of exponents (integers).\n- **G**: The group in which the cryptographic operations are performed (e.g., a cyclic group).\n- **K [large, fixed]**: The type for keys.\n- **D [fixed]**: The type for messages and ciphertexts.\n\n#### Assumptions\n- **CDH Assumption**: The protocol assumes the hardness of the Computational Diffie-Hellman problem, which states that given \\( g^x \\) and \\( g^y \\), it is hard to compute \\( g^{xy} \\).\n\n#### Functions and Constants\n- **fun exp(G,Z): G**: Exponentiation function that raises an element of group G to an exponent in Z.\n- **const gamma: G**: A constant generator for the group G.\n- **fun mult(Z,Z): Z**: A function that multiplies two integers.\n- **fun xor(D,D): D**: A function that represents the XOR operation for the messages.\n- **fun h(K,G): D**: A hash function modeled as a random oracle which generates a hash from a key and a group element.\n- **fun choose(bool,D,D): D**: A conditional function that selects one of two values based on a boolean condition.\n\n#### Core Properties\n1. **Exponentiation Properties**:\n   - The protocol defines properties of exponentiation such as the multiplication of exponents corresponding to the operation of the group.\n\n2. **XOR Properties**:\n   - The XOR operation is self-canceling and behaves like a one-time pad, enhancing security.\n\n3. **Hash Function Properties**:\n   - The hash function behaves according to the random oracle model, providing consistent and unpredictable outputs while maintaining defined behavior.\n\n4. **Security Proof**:\n   - The scheme is shown to be secure under the CDH assumption, ensuring that if a polynomial-time adversary can distinguish between the real ciphertext and a random one, then they can solve the CDH problem efficiently.\n\n#### Process Description\n- The process begins by sending a public key derived from a random exponent.\n- Two separate processes handle encryption (`processE`) and hashing (`processH`):\n  - `processE` takes in two messages, allows the sender to choose one based on a boolean value, derives a secret value, hashes a derived value, and outputs the encrypted result.\n  - `processH` allows querying of the hash function directly and returns the hash of a provided element from the group.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThis Hashed ElGamal encryption scheme presents a secure method for encrypting messages in the random oracle model while leveraging the hardness of the CDH assumption. The protocol's structure supports both confidentiality and authenticity within a chosen plaintext attack framework.\n\n---\n\nThis description contains all necessary details about the protocol's structure, functions, properties, and security assumptions, which can be used to generate an equivalent CV file for verification in Cryptoverif."]]}, "CV-1/ind_cca2.cv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *       Translation from CryptoVerif to EasyCrypt           *\n *                                                           *\n *       Bruno Blanchet, Pierre Boutry, Christian Doczkal,   *\n *       and Pierre-Yves Strub                               *\n *                                                           *\n *       Copyright INRIA, MPI-SP, Ecole Polytechnique,       *\n *\t 2019-2024                                           *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    Copyright INRIA, MPI-SP, Ecole Polytechnique\n    contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\n                  Pierre Boutry, Pierre.Boutry@inria.fr\n                  Christian Doczkal, Christian.Doczkal@mpi-sp.org\n                  Pierre-Yves Strub, pierre-yves@strub.nu\n\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to translate\nCryptoVerif security assumptions into EasyCrypt.\n\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

The scheme involves the generation of public-private key pairs, encryption of plaintext messages using public keys, and decryption using the corresponding private keys.\n\n**Types:**\n- `pkey`: Public key type, bounded \u2013 represents the public key used for encryption.\n- `skey`: Secret key type, bounded \u2013 represents the secret key used for decryption.\n- `keyseed`: Fixed type \u2013 seed used for the generation of keys.\n- `cleartext`: Type representing plaintext messages.\n- `ciphertext`: Type representing encrypted messages.\n- `enc_seed`: Bounded type representing randomness used during encryption.\n\n**Parameters:**\n- `N`: Parameter representing the number of encryption operations allowed.\n- `N2`: Parameter representing the number of decryption operations allowed during the protocol.\n\n**Probability:**\n- `Penc`: Represents the probability associated with the encryption process being performed.\n\n**Functions:**\n1. `Z(cleartext)`: Identity function on cleartexts, returning the input cleartext.\n2. `enc(cleartext, pkey, enc_seed)`: Function for encrypting a cleartext using a public key and an encryption seed, returning a ciphertext.\n3. `skgen(keyseed)`: Generates a secret key from a given key seed.\n4. `pkgen(keyseed)`: Generates a public key from a given key seed.\n5. `dec(ciphertext, skey)`: Function for decrypting a given ciphertext using the secret key, returning a result which can be a bitstring or a bot (indicating failure).\n6. `injbot(cleartext)`: Injects a failure state (bottom) for a cleartext, meaning that the operation does not return a meaningful output.\n\n**Equations:**\nAn essential property of the protocol states that for all messages `m`, keys `k` (keyseed), and random seeds `r` (enc_seed):\n- The decryption of a ciphertext produced by encrypting `m` with a public key derived from `k`, using a secret key generated from `k`, equates to injecting a bottom state (indicating failure). This encodes that any decryption of a ciphertext should return an indication of failure if it does not appropriately align with the known plaintext.\n\n**Cipher Table:**\nThe protocol maintains a table `cipher(cleartext, ciphertext)` to relate plaintexts and their corresponding ciphertexts, facilitating the chosen ciphertext attack analysis.\n\n**Main Process:**\nThe main process of the protocol operates according to the following stages:\n1. Randomly generate a keyseed `k`.\n2. Generate a public key from the keyseed.\n3. Provide decryption results for a ciphertext based on either returning the decryption or injecting failure if the ciphertext does not correspond to expected plaintexts.\n4. Allow the encryption of cleartexts with their associated public keys and maintain the correspondence in the cipher table.\n\n**Security Equivalence:**\nThe protocol formulates an equivalence to the CCA2 security condition, ensuring that the encryption and decryption processes hold under the defined probabilities and constraints, aiming to secure against any chosen ciphertext attacks.\n\n---\n\nUsing this description content, a corresponding CryptoVerif (CV) file can be created that captures the aforementioned protocol characteristics and security properties.

It involves the use of a symmetric key encryption mechanism, where a plaintext message is encrypted using a randomly generated key and an encryption seed.\n\n#### Types\n- `cleartext`: Represents plaintext messages that are to be encrypted.\n- `ciphertext`: Represents the encrypted output, which is obtained after applying the encryption function to a cleartext.\n- `key`: A bounded type representing the cryptographic keys used in the encryption process.\n- `enc_seed`: A bounded type that serves as the randomness input (seed) for the encryption process.\n\n#### Functions\n- `enc(cleartext, key, enc_seed)`: A function that takes a `cleartext`, a `key`, and an `enc_seed`, and returns a `ciphertext`. This is the core encryption function that transforms plaintext into ciphertext.\n- `Z(cleartext)`: A function that takes a `cleartext` and returns another `cleartext`. This function is likely intended to represent a transformation or preprocessing step for the plaintext before encryption.\n\n#### Parameters\n- `N`: A parameter representing the number of encryption operations to perform in a single process execution instance.\n- `Penc`: A probability distribution function related to the encryption process, likely used to analyze the indistinguishability property.\n\n#### Indistinguishability Assumption\n- The equivalence statement `equiv(ind_cpa(enc))` defines the indistinguishability under a chosen plaintext attack. This is represented in the following manner:\n  - A key `k` is randomly selected from the `key` type.\n  - For each iteration (`foreach i <= N`), a random `enc_seed` `r` is generated, and the encryption of a cleartext `x` is performed using the function `Oenc(x:cleartext)`, which returns `enc(x, k, r)`.\n  - The output is conditioned on the probability `Penc(time, N, maxlength(x))`, which likely assesses the complexity or some security measure involving time, the number of operations, and the maximum length of the input cleartext.\n  - In the second part of the equivalence, the same process is repeated with the transformed cleartext `Z(x)` to show that an adversary cannot distinguish between the encryption of `x` and `Z(x)`.\n\n#### Process Definition\n- The protocol execution is encapsulated in `process 0`, which implies the initial or base process of the protocol that utilizes the above constructs.\n\n---\n\n### Generated CV File\nFrom the description provided, the corresponding CV file can be structured exactly as presented in the original content.

Coron in terms of reduction. The protocol is designed to operate under a computational model and consists of a prover and a verifier that communicate over defined channels.\n\n### Key Components of the Protocol\n\n1. **Parameters and Types:**\n   - The protocol has a parameter `qS`, which specifies the number of signature queries allowed.\n   - Various types are defined, including public keys (`pkey`), secret keys (`skey`), hash keys (`hashkey`), seeds, and some bounded data types for use in the protocol.\n\n2. **Cryptographic Primitives:**\n   - The protocol incorporates a *one-way trapdoor permutation* mechanism which is essential for the construction of the signature scheme. This is represented by `proba pOW` with defined processes for key generation and signing.\n   - A *random oracle model* is used for the hash function, abstracting the process of hash computation through an oracle model, where `hash` serves as the hash function and `hashoracle` represents the oracle.\n\n3. **Processes:**\n   - Two primary processes are defined: `processS` (the prover) and `processT` (the verifier).\n     - **Prover (`processS`)**: \n       - Receives a message `m` and generates a random seed `sr`.\n       - Computes a signature using a message function `mf` based on the secret key and the hash of the message combined with the random seed.\n       - Outputs the signature via channel `c2`.\n     - **Verifier (`processT`)**:\n       - Receives the signature and inputs from the prover.\n       - Validates the signature by checking that it corresponds to the hash of the original message signed by the public key.\n       - If validation fails, it triggers a `bad` event.\n\n4. **Main Process**: \n   - Initializes by receiving a start signal, generates a hash key and key seed, then derives public and secret keys using the respective generator functions.\n   - Outputs the public key to channel `c0` and runs the hash oracle along with the prover and verifier processes.\n\n### Security Properties\nThe primary aim of the protocol is to ensure the security of the signatures generated with respect to the underlying one-way function and integrity of the hash operations. The inclusion of the event `bad` provides a mechanism to detect failures in verification, ensuring that any forgery attempt can be flagged properly.\n\n### Expected Behavior\nThe CV proof aims to verify that all queries and operations complete successfully, validating the integrity of the protocol's cryptographic properties under the specified model of computation. The expected output indicates that no flaws were found in the protocol during the verification process.\n\n---\n\nThis description outlines the purpose and function of the CV protocol articulated in the provided code. The essential elements of the cryptographic protocol, including its setup, operations, and security aims, are highlighted to ensure clarity for those looking to understand and replicate this model using the Cryptoverif tool."]]}, "CV-1/Kyber.ocv": {"code": [[true, "proof {\nsimplify coll_elim(variables:z_1);\ninsert before \"if secb\" \"if pk_6 = pk' then\";\ninsert before_nth 1 \"if secb\" \"if ct_3 = c_1 then\";\n\nall_simplify;\nall_simplify;\nsuccess\n}\n\n(* Types for abstract CPA KEM *)\ntype cpa_pk [bounded].

Below is a detailed description of the protocol as per the specification, which can help in generating a corresponding OCV file that can be run by CryptoVerif.\n\n### Description of the Protocol\n\n1. **Types and Data Structures**:\n   - The protocol employs several types of data structures (or \"types\") relevant to the CPA KEM, including:\n     - `cpa_pk`: Public key.\n     - `cpa_sk`: Secret key.\n     - `cpa_ciphertext`: The ciphertext generated during encryption.\n     - `cpa_key_seed` and `cpa_enc_seed`: Seeds for generating keys and ciphertext.\n\n   - For the final CCA KEM, additional types include:\n     - `kemskey`: Represents the key material for the KEM.\n     - `ciphertext`: A generic term for any ciphertext.\n     - `kem_seed`: The seed used for KEM operations.\n\n2. **Hash Functions**:\n   - The protocol uses hash functions with specific mechanisms to ensure collision resistance, allowing for secure unique outputs for distinct inputs. The hashes are processed through `hashkey`, `hashkey2`, and `hashkey3`.\n\n3. **Key Generation**:\n   - Key pairs for the CPA protocol are generated using functions:\n     - `cpa_pkgen(cpa_key_seed)`: Generates public key.\n     - `cpa_skgen(cpa_key_seed)`: Generates secret key.\n   - The final KEM key pair generation is done using `KEM_KeyPair(cpa_pk, kemskey)`.\n\n4. **Encryption and Decryption**:\n   - The core operations of the protocol include:\n     - Encryption: `cpa_enc(cpa_pk, hashes, cpa_enc_seed)`, which encrypts a message based on the public key and seeds.\n     - Decryption: `cpa_dec(cpa_sk, cpa_ciphertext)`, which decrypts the ciphertext back to the original message.\n\n5. **Encapsulation**:\n   - The encapsulation process uses the `KEMEncaps` function, which produces a ciphertext from the `cpa_ciphertext` and outputs a shared key.\n\n6. **CCA Security**:\n   - The protocol maintains CCA security through encapsulation and decapsulation processes. It checks whether the decrypted ciphertext matches the original before revealing the shared secret.\n\n7. **Constructs for Process Execution**:\n   - The main function `Start()` initiates the protocol, generates the necessary keys and runs the hash functions, establishing a secure environment for KEM operations.\n   - It includes an interaction mechanism, `OChall`, for challenges based on the state of the secret bit `secb`, which dictates the outcome of the game (whether to reveal the secret or return the ciphertext).\n\n8. **Query Distribution**:\n   - The protocol sets queries for a secret bit (`secb`) to test security properties, while merging branches and renaming autoSAR (Single-Access Resolution) operations.\n\n9. **Final Output**:\n   - The goal of the construction is to demonstrate that the decapsulation mechanism mirrors the secret extraction from a KEM, ensuring that the security properties hold under given assumptions.\n\n### Implementation in OCV\n\nTo create the corresponding OCV file for implementation in CryptoVerif, the structure provided in the above description can directly translate into a defined structure of types, functions, and processes similar to the provided OCV code.

This description highlights the various components, functionalities, and security aspects of the protocol, which can be used to generate the corresponding CV file for analysis with the CryptVerif tool:\n\n---\n\n### Description of the OAEP Scheme (Proof of CPA Security)\n\nThe OAEP scheme is a widely-used encryption algorithm that enhances the security of asymmetric encryption schemes against chosen plaintext attacks (CPA). The protocol achieves this by padding the plaintext with random data before encryption, making patterns in plaintext less discernible once encrypted. In this proof, we demonstrate the CPA security of the OAEP scheme using CryptVerif.\n\n#### Components:\n\n1. **Key Generation**: \n   - The scheme involves a public key (`pkey`) and a private key (`skey`), generated via the functions `pkgen` and `skgen`, respectively, using a random seed (`seed`).\n\n2. **Trapdoor Permutations**: \n   - The protocol employs a partial-domain one-way trapdoor permutation described by the expansion `set_PD_OW_trapdoor_perm`. This allows the transformation of inputs in a way that is easy to compute in one direction but hard to reverse without the trapdoor information.\n\n3. **Hash Functions**:\n   - Two cryptographic hash functions, `H` and `G`, are incorporated into the scheme, modeled as random oracles. These functions are invoked multiple times throughout the encryption process to ensure that the output remains unpredictable.\n\n4. **Padding and Concatenation**: \n   - A concatenation function (`concatm`) is used to combine padded messages, ensuring that padding is included in the data being encrypted.\n\n5. **XOR Operations**: \n   - XOR operations (`xorDr` and `xorDow`) are used to add randomness to the encrypted messages, enhancing their security against cryptanalysis.\n\n#### Protocol Functionality:\n\n- The encryption process involves receiving plaintext messages (`m1`, `m2`) and determining which message to encrypt based on a boolean variable (`b1`). This enables the choice between two potential messages while maintaining the integrity of the process.\n\n- A challenge response mechanism is set up, where the interaction via channels (`c0`, `c1`, `c2`) facilitates the transfer of keys and encrypted messages. The system generates and uses the hash keys (`hkh`, `hkg`) during encryption.\n\n- The output of the encryption process is generated by combining the hashed, padded message and a challenge derived from the hash outputs, secured via trapdoor permutation.\n\n#### Queries and Security:\n\n- The proof includes queries (e.g., `secret1 b1`) that allow us to analyze the security properties of the scheme. The `bad1` and `bad2` events are introduced to track potential breaches in security.\n\n- The `success` statement at the end of the proof signifies that the system has shown the necessary properties for CPA security under the defined conditions.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nThis OAEP scheme provides a robust framework for secure asymmetric encryption, with the CryptVerif proof affirming its resistance to chosen plaintext attacks. By defining various components such as the trapdoor permutation, hash functions, and padding mechanisms, we ensure the overall integrity and security of the encrypted data.\n\n---\n\nThis description serves as a comprehensive overview of the OAEP protocol for generating the CV file.

This description outlines the entities involved, the assumptions made, the functionalities provided, and the processes executed. Here's how we can summarize it:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Participants\n\n1. **Hosts**: \n   - The protocol involves agents known as hosts, denoted as `A` (one group of agents) and `B` (another group of agents). \n   - The number of agents in each group is parameterized as `NA` for `A` and `NB` for `B`.\n\n2. **Keys**:\n   - Each host possesses a public key (`pkey`) and a secret key (`skey`). Public keys are generated from a random seed (`keyseed`), which ensures unique key pairs for each session.\n\n#### Cryptographic Primitives\n\n1. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**:\n   - The protocol utilizes Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange, which allows hosts to derive a shared secret over an insecure channel.\n   - A generator `g` of a finite group `G` is used, with the exponentiation function defined as `exp`. \n   - The protocol includes assumptions about the collision resistance of keys generated during this exchange, with parameters `PCollKey1` and `PCollKey2` that define the probabilities of potential collisions.\n\n2. **Collision/Assumptions**:\n   - The protocol makes several collision assumptions, particularly related to the collision of Diffie-Hellman outputs and the security of the keys generated. These are encapsulated in the parameters `pCDH` (computational Diffie-Hellman assumption) and probabilities for key collisions.\n  \n3. **Hash Function**:\n   - A hash function defined as `hash` is used in the random oracle model, generating outputs (`key`) based on inputs from groups, allowing secure and unpredictable hashing required for signing messages.\n\n4. **Signatures**:\n   - The signing process leverages a secure signature mechanism characterized by the ability to create signatures without revealing the signing key. The probability of successfully forging a signature (`Psign`) and the probability of collisions among independently generated keys (`Psigncoll`) is defined.\n\n#### Processes\n\n1. **Key Generation**:\n   - Each host generates their signing keys (secret and public) from a random key seed during the protocol initiation.\n\n2. **Process for Each Agent**:\n   - `processA` and `processB` are defined for the respective groups of agents. These processes include logic to handle cryptographic operations and message handling, yet to be implemented in specific frames.\n\n3. **PKI Operation**:\n   - A Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) process (`pki`) is planned to manage interactions involving the public keys of both hosts.\n\n4. **Main Process**:\n   - The main execution process (`Ostart`) initializes the execution context, generates keys for both hosts, and subsequently runs the individual agent processes, manages PKI interactions, and executes the hash oracle function.\n\n#### Security Considerations\n\n- The protocol is designed to provide secure key exchange between the two peer groups (`A` and `B`) and ensure that the public keys are reliably generated and used to authenticate messages. Security measures against signature forgery and key collision are explicitly addressed with defined probabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Note\n\nThe description covers high-level aspects of the protocol, and the implementation details for the functions such as key generation, signing, and verification processes are explicitly marked as needing further development (marked as TODO). The interactions and specific cryptographic operations will be filled in as per the requirements during the actual implementation phase in the OCV file for testing in CryptoVerif."]]}, "CV-1/tls13-core-RecordProtocol-0RTT.cv": {"code": [[true, "(******************************************************************\n *                                                                *\n * Cryptographic protocol verifier                                *\n *                                                                *\n * Bruno Blanchet, David Cad\u00e9, Aymeric Fromherz, Charlie Jacomme, *\n * and Benjamin Lipp                                              *\n *                                                                *\n * Copyright (C) ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP, 2005-2024              *\n *                                                                *\n ******************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    Copyright ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP\n    contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\n                  David Cad\u00e9\n                  Aymeric Fromherz, Aymeric.Fromherz@inria.fr\n                  Charlie Jacomme, Charlie.Jacomme@inria.fr\n                  Benjamin Lipp, benjamin.lipp@mpi-sp.org\n\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to verify \ncryptographic protocols in the computational model.\n\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

Each session starts with the assumption that the client and server share a random secret (traffic_secret), which plays a key role in generating cryptographic keys and nonces.\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **Data Types and Parameters**:\n   - **Key**: A type representing cryptographic keys, which are large and fixed in size.\n   - **Sequence Number (seqn)**: A fixed-size type used for tracking message counts, ensuring messages are sent in proper order and preventing replay attacks.\n   - **Nonce**: A type representing random values that are unique for each communication session.\n   - **N, Nk, Ne, Nd, Ns, NSr, Nr**: Parameters controlling the protocol's operation, where N represents the number of messages to be processed, and Nk, Ne, Nd, Ns represent various key and nonce factors.\n\n2. **Hashing and Key Derivation**:\n   - **HKDF (HMAC-based Key Derivation Function)**: Functions `HKDF_expand_upd_label`, `HKDF_expand_key_label`, and `HKDF_expand_iv_label` are employed to derive keys, initialization vectors (IVs), and other session parameters from the shared traffic_secret.\n\n3. **Probabilities**:\n   - **Pprf_upd_key_iv**, **Penc**, **Pencctxt**: Probabilities associated with the security properties of the key updating and encryption mechanisms.\n\n4. **Encryption**:\n   - The protocol utilizes **Authenticated Encryption with Associated Data (AEAD)**, ensuring that confidentiality (IND-CPA) and integrity (INT-CTXT) are maintained as long as nonces remain distinct for each encryption.\n   - Functions `AEAD_encrypt` and `AEAD_decrypt` facilitate the encryption and decryption processes.\n\n5. **Reuse Prevention**:\n   - Tables (`table_count_send` and `table_count_recv`) are employed to track previously used sequence numbers and prevent their reuse in messaging.\n\n6. **Security Properties**:\n   - The protocol includes queries to verify the secrecy of the plaintext messages and the security of the traffic_secret key.\n   - Events are used to track the sending and receiving of messages, allowing the verifier to assert that messages received match those sent, linked to the associated sequence numbers.\n\n#### Process Flow\n1. **Initialization**: The protocol begins by interacting through I/O channels, reporting when the client initializes its session. The client generates a traffic_secret and derives session keys and IVs.\n  \n2. **Message Sending**: The `send` function handles the preparation and transmission of messages, including:\n   - Ensuring that the sequence number has not been reused.\n   - Encrypting the message with AEAD before sending it to the server.\n\n3. **Message Receiving**: The `receive` function listens for incoming messages, processes them using the derived keys and nonces, and ensures that the sequence number is unique for the session.\n  \n4. **Event Logging**: Throughout the process, the protocol logs the sending and receiving of messages, enabling verification of these events against the established security properties.\n\n#### Expected Results\nUpon running this protocol file with CryptVerif, it is anticipated that all specified security properties will be proven successfully without any vulnerabilities being detected. Performance metrics indicate a fast execution time, demonstrating the protocol's efficiency in terms of computational resources.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\nThis protocol effectively employs cryptographic techniques to secure communications between a client and server, ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and non-repudiation while protecting against common attacks such as replay and message tampering. The secrets and session management strategies employed provide strong guarantees of security under the defined assumptions."]]}, "CV-1/woolampkcorrSimp.cv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *       Cryptographic protocol verifier                     *\n *                                                           *\n *       Bruno Blanchet and David Cad\u00e9                       *\n *                                                           *\n *       Copyright (C) ENS, CNRS, INRIA, 2005-2015           *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    Copyright ENS, CNRS, INRIA \n    contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\n                  David Cad\u00e9\n\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to verify \ncryptographic protocols in the computational model.\n\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

The annotations enhance understanding without altering the code functionality."]], "logic": [[true, "The provided Cryptographic Verification (CV) file describes a public-key authentication protocol inspired by the work of Woo and Lam (1997). Below is a comprehensive summary of the protocol elements and processes as reflected in the CV file. This description can aid in generating an equivalent CV file for use in the Cryptoverif tool.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n1. **Parameters and Types**:\n   - Four parameters (`N`, `N2`, `N3`, `N4`) are declared, with `N` being a nonce, which is a unique random value used in cryptographic communications to prevent replay attacks.\n   - Types are defined to represent various elements:\n     - `nonce` as a large, fixed-size type.\n     - `host`, `pkey` (public key), and `skey` (secret key) as bounded types.\n     - `keyseed` as a large, fixed type.\n     - `seed`, `signature` as fixed and bounded types respectively.\n     - `blocksize` as a fixed-size and `blocksizebot` as a bounded type.\n   - A function `concat1` concatenates a public key, host, and nonce into a block.\n\n2. **Signature Scheme**:\n   - The protocol utilizes a signature scheme characterized by existential unforgeability under chosen-message attack (UF-CMA). Two probabilities `Psign` and `Psigncoll` are used to analyze the signature generation and collision.\n\n3. **Channels and Events**:\n   - Multiple communication channels (`c0` to `c13`) are established for message transmission between entities.\n   - Two events, `eA` and `eB`, are defined to signify particular states in the protocol where public key and host information along with a nonce is broadcasted.\n\n4. **Queries**:\n   - Two queries are specified to represent the logical conditions under which event `eB` must imply event `eA`:\n     - The first query confirms the event `eA` is generated from `eB`.\n     - The second query explores the injection into the events.\n\n5. **Processes**:\n   - **Process A**: \n     - Listens on channel `c2` to receive a nonce and a host from the network.\n     - Generates a new random seed and sends a signed message containing a concatenation of the public key, host, and nonce on channel `c3`.\n   - **Process B**:\n     - Listens on channel `c4` for a public key.\n     - Generates a new nonce and sends it along with the predefined constant host `B` to channel `c5`.\n     - Checks the signature received through channel `c6` to ensure it is valid for the concatenated message. If valid, it triggers the event `eB`.\n\n6. **Overall Process**:\n   - A main process begins by listening on channel `c0` and generates a key seed. It then generates the public and secret key pairs and shares the public key on channel `c1`. This main process orchestrates concurrent execution of `processA` and `processB` \n\n### Cryptoverif CV File Generation\n\nBased on this description, you can create a new CV file similar to the input example, maintaining the same structure, channel definitions, process definitions, and event logging mechanisms. This ensures that the newly created CV file retains the logical flow and functionality of the original authentication protocol, enabling Cryptoverif to analyze it effectively. \n\nThe critical structure includes defining the types, specifying public key authentication along with signing processes, and delineating communication flows clearly through dedicated channels, all of which together ensure a robust representation of the authentication protocol for verification."]]}}
