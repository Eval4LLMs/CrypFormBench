It establishes a secure communication channel between an initiator (I) and a responder (R) using session keys and nonces. This protocol is modeled according to the specifications found in the SPORE library and aims to provide confidentiality and integrity assurances for messages exchanged in a potentially adversarial environment.\n\n**Roles:**\n1. **Initiator (I):** \n   - The party that begins the communication.\n   - Generates a nonce (ni) to ensure message freshness.\n   - Sends the nonce to the responder along with its identity.\n   - Receives a message containing the session key (kir) encrypted with a shared key and the responder's identity.\n\n2. **Responder (R):**\n   - The party that responds to the initiator's request.\n   - Receives the initiator's identity and nonce.\n   - Generates its own nonce (nr) and a session key (kir).\n   - Sends back a message that includes the initiator's nonce, the session key, and its identity, encrypted with the shared key.\n\n**Message Exchange:**\n1. **Step 1 (I -> R):** The initiator sends its identity and a nonce to the responder.\n   - `send_1(I, R, I, ni)`\n\n2. **Step 2 (R -> I):** The responder replies with a message containing the initiator's nonce, its generated session key, and its identity, all encrypted with their shared key.\n   - `recv_2(R, I, {ni, kir, R}k(I, R))`\n\n3. **Step 3 (I -> R):** The initiator sends the session key back to the responder, using the nonce to ensure freshness.\n   - `send_3(I, R, {ni}kir)`\n\n4. **Step 4 (R -> I):** The responder sends its nonce back to the initiator.\n   - `recv_4(R, I, nr)`\n\n**Claims:**\n- The initiator (I) asserts the following:\n  - **Claim I1:** The communication is synchronized (Nisynch).\n  - **Claim I2:** The session key (kir) is secret.\n  - **Claim I3:** The session key (kir) is fresh.\n\n- The responder (R) makes analogous claims:\n  - **Claim R1:** The communication is synchronized (Nisynch).\n  - **Claim R2:** The session key (kir) is secret.\n  - **Claim R3:** The session key (kir) is fresh.\n\n**Security Considerations:**\n- The shared key between the initiator and responder is modeled as `k(I, R)`, but it is noted that the symmetry (i.e., `k(R, I)`) is not expressible in this model, potentially leaving some attack vectors undetected.\n- The placement of the message exchange step (Recv 4 by the Initiator) after the synchronization claim helps prevent trivial synchronization attacks.\n\n**Known Vulnerabilities:**\nAccording to the SPORE library, there are currently no known attacks against this modified protocol, and it is designed to operate securely under its specified assumptions.\n\n--- \n\nThis description content can be utilized to generate an SPDL file that aligns with the specified protocol characteristics and security assertions as modeled in Scyther."]]}, "SPDL-1/tls-BM-1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/*\n * This is a model of a version of the TLS protocol as modeled in\n * Boyd, Mathuria \"Protocols for Authentication and key establishment\"\n *\n * It's a very simplified form.\n */\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n/* below is just Scyther input and no further macro definitions */\n\nconst pk,hash: Function;\nsecret sk,unhash: Function;\ninversekeys(pk,sk);\ninversekeys(hash,unhash);\n\nconst Alice, Bob, Eve: Agent;\nconst Terence: Agent;\n\n// The TLS protocol model begins here\nprotocol tls-bm-1(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tfresh na: Nonce;

Below is a concise description of the protocol based on the SPDL content provided:\n\n### Protocol Description: Simplified TLS (tls-bm-1)\n\n#### Overview\nThe described protocol is a simplified version of the TLS protocol, which is commonly used to secure communications over a computer network. The primary goal of this model is to establish a secure session between two parties, Alice and Bob, while preventing eavesdropping or tampering by an adversary, Eve.\n\n#### Agents\n- **Alice**: The initiator of the protocol, who wants to establish a secure channel.\n- **Bob**: The responder who receives messages from Alice.\n- **Eve**: An adversary who tries to listen in on the communication between Alice and Bob.\n\n#### Key Components\n1. **Nonces**:\n   - **na** (Nonce generated by Alice): Used to ensure freshness of the messages.\n   - **nb** (Nonce generated by Bob): Used to ensure freshness from Bob\u2019s side.\n   - **pmk** (Pre-Master Key): A key shared between Alice and Bob, encrypted using Bob's public key.\n\n2. **Cryptographic Functions**:\n   - **pk**: Public key function that enables the encryption of messages.\n   - **hash**: A function that produces a fixed-size output (hash) from input data, which is used for integrity checking.\n   - **sk**: Secret key function allowing decryption of messages encrypted with the corresponding public key.\n\n#### Protocol Steps\n1. **Step 1** (Alice to Bob):\n   - Alice generates a fresh nonce `na` and a pre-master key `pmk`.\n   - She sends the nonce `na` to Bob.\n\n2. **Step 2** (Bob to Alice):\n   - Bob receives `na` and generates his own nonce `nb`.\n   - He sends the nonce `nb` back to Alice.\n\n3. **Step 3** (Alice to Bob):\n   - Alice creates a message that includes:\n     - The pre-master key `pmk` encrypted with Bob's public key.\n     - A hash value that ties together both nonces and the pre-master key, signed with her secret key.\n     - A hash of the original message, ensuring integrity.\n   - She sends this message to Bob.\n\n4. **Step 4** (Bob to Alice):\n   - Bob receives Alice's message and constructs a response message that contains:\n     - Both nonces and the pre-master key encrypted with Bob\u2019s public key.\n     - The same hashed information signed with Alice\u2019s secret key.\n   - This message is sent back to Alice and includes an integrity check.\n\n#### Claims\n- **Claim A1**: Alice claims that she has established a secret represented by the hash of the pre-master key and both nonces.\n- **Claim A2**: Alice asserts that there is no synchronization issue in the communication.\n- **Claim B1**: Bob makes an equivalent claim regarding the secret established.\n- **Claim B2**: Bob confirms there is no synchronization issue in the communication.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe `tls-bm-1` protocol effectively demonstrates an authentication and key establishment procedure that is symmetric in authentication along with key verification using nonces and cryptographic techniques, aiming to secure communication between two entities in the presence of an adversary. This simplistic model serves as a foundational representation of the more complex TLS standard, illustrating essential aspects of secure communication protocols."]]}, "SPDL-1/denning-sacco-lowe.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# Lowe modified Denning-Sacco shared key\n#\n# Modelled after the description in the SPORE library\n# http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/denningSaccoLowe.html\n#\n# Note:\n# According to SPORE there are no attacks on this protocol.

This protocol is designed to allow secure communication between the initiator and the responder, ensuring that the session key is unique and fresh for each session. \n\n### Roles\n1. **Initiator (I)**: The party that initiates the communication and requests a session key.\n2. **Responder (R)**: The party that receives the request from the initiator and responds with the session key.\n3. **Server (S)**: The trusted third party that helps set up the session key between the initiator and the responder.\n\n### Flow of Messages\n\n1. **Initiation**: \n   - The initiator (I) sends a message to the server (S) with its identity and the identity of the responder (R).\n   \n2. **Ticket Generation**: \n   - Upon receiving the initiation request, the server (S) generates a session key (Kir), a timestamp (T), and a ticket (W) that is sent back to the initiator (I) along with the identity of the responder (R).\n   - The message sent from S to I is encrypted with the keys shared between I and S.\n\n3. **Sending the Session Key**: \n   - The initiator (I) forwards the ticket (W) to the responder (R). This message is also encrypted with the session key shared between I and R.\n\n4. **Nonce Exchange**: \n   - The responder (R) generates a nonce (Nr), and sends this back to the initiator (I) encrypted with the session key (Kir).\n   \n5. **Confirmation**: \n   - The initiator (I) confirms receipt of the nonce by responding with the decrypted nonce back to R, completing the key exchange securely.\n\n### Claims\nThe protocol allows for various claims to verify its security properties, including:\n- **Agreement Claims**: To verify that both parties have agreed on the session key.\n- **Synchronization Claims**: To ensure that the communication is synchronized between parties.\n- **Secret Claims**: To establish that the session key is secret and not compromised.\n- **Freshness Claims**: To ensure that the session key and other cryptographic variables are fresh and not reused from previous sessions.\n\n### Security Considerations\nThe protocol has been modeled based on descriptions from academic literature and the SPORE library. Notably, while SPORE indicates that there are no attacks on this protocol, simulation results using Scyther suggest the existence of pre-play attacks on the initial message, which could lead to synchronization issues. Such attacks may not have practical implications unless strict consistency is required for activities like logging or auditing.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe Lowe modified Denning-Sacco protocol is a relatively secure method for establishing shared keys with the assistance of a trusted server, though attention must be paid to potential synchronization vulnerabilities identified in practical simulations. \n\n--- \n\nThis structured description provides a solid foundation to reconstruct the SPDL file using the Scyther tool for analyzing the protocol's security properties."]]}, "SPDL-1/kaochow.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# Kao Chow Authentication v.1\n#\n# Modelled after the description in the SPORE library\n# http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/kaoChow1.html\n#\n\nusertype SessionKey;\nconst Fresh: Function;\nconst Compromised: Function;\n\nprotocol kaochow(I,R,S)\n{\n    role I\n    {\n        # Initiator role that starts the authentication process\n        fresh ni: Nonce;  # Fresh nonce generated by the initiator\n        var nr: Nonce;    # Nonce returned by responder\n        var kir: SessionKey;  # Session key established for communication\n\n        # Step 1: Initiator sends its identity (I), responder identity (R), and nonce (ni)\n        send_1 (I,S, I,R,ni);\n        \n        # Step 2: Receives from R, the response including the session key and nonce verification\n        recv_3 (R,I, {I,R,ni,kir}k(I,S), {ni}kir, nr );\n        \n        # Step 3: Sends its nonce (nr) encrypted with the session key\n        send_4 (I,R, {nr}kir );\n\n        # Claims made by the initiator regarding synchronization and agreed secrets\n        claim_I1 (I, Nisynch);  \n        claim_I2 (I, Niagree);  \n        claim_I3 (I, Secret, kir);  \n        claim_I4 (I, Empty, (Fresh,kir));  \n    }    \n    \n    role R\n    {\n        # Responder role that validates the initiation from I\n        var ni: Nonce;  # Nonce received from initiator\n        fresh nr: Nonce;  # Fresh nonce generated by the responder\n        var kir: SessionKey;  # Session key established for communication\n        var T;  # Placeholder for transport or additional information if needed\n\n        # Step 1: Receives initiation from I and validates using symmetric encryption\n        recv_2 (S,R, T, { I,R,ni,kir }k(R,S) ); \n        \n        # Step 2: Sends back the nonce (ni) with its own nonce (nr)\n        send_3 (R,I, T, {ni}kir, nr );\n        \n        # Step 3: Receives the response from I confirming its nonce\n        recv_4 (I,R, {nr}kir );\n\n        # Claims made by the responder regarding synchronization and agreed secrets\n        claim_R1 (R, Nisynch);  \n        claim_R2 (R, Niagree);  \n        claim_R3 (R, Secret, kir);  \n        claim_R4 (R, Empty, (Fresh,kir));  \n    }\n\n    role S\n    {\n        # Server role that facilitates the communication between I and R\n        var ni: Nonce;  # Nonce obtained from initiator\n        fresh kir: SessionKey;  # Fresh session key generated by the server\n\n        # Step 1: Receives initial message from I\n        recv_1 (I,S, I,R,ni);\n        \n        # Step 2: Sends a message back to I and R, including an encrypted session key\n        send_2 (S,R, {I,R,ni,kir}k(I,S), { I,R,ni,kir }k(R,S)  ); \n    }\n}", "Here\u2019s the modified SPDL code file with added notations that maintain the original code.

It assists in the key exchange but does not participate in the actual communication once it has delivered the keys.\n\n3. **Protocol Steps:**\n   - **Step 1:** The Initiator (I) sends a message to the Server (S) indicating I wish to communicate with Responder (R).\n   - **Step 2:** The Server (S), upon receiving the request, sends back the public key of R along with R's identity, encrypted with its own secret key.\n   - **Step 3:** The Initiator (I) then sends a message to Responder (R) containing its nonce (Ni) and its identity, encrypted with R's public key.\n   - **Step 4:** Responder (R) receives the message from I, decrypts it, and sends a message back to the Server (S) to indicate it wants to authenticate itself to I.\n   - **Step 5:** The Server (S) sends back the public key of I along with I's identity, encrypted with its own secret key.\n   - **Step 6:** Responder (R) now sends a message to Initiator (I) that includes both nonces (Ni and Nr), encrypted with I's public key.\n   - **Step 7:** Finally, Initiator (I) receives the message from Responder (R), decrypts it, and sends back the nonce (Nr) to R, completing the authentication.\n\n4. **Claims:**\n   - Each party claims possession of its nonce, which signifies the session's freshness and establishes mutual authentication between the Initiator and Responder.\n   - The claim of synchronization (Nisynch) indicates that both parties are correctly engaged in the communication session.\n\n5. **Security Considerations:**\n   - The protocol is designed to prevent replay attacks, as each party uses fresh nonces.\n   - By using public keys and encrypting communication, confidentiality is also achieved between the parties.\n\n### SPDL File Generation\n\nBased on this description, a corresponding SPDL file that models the Needham-Schroeder Public Key protocol can be generated.

Below is a description content of the Otway-Rees protocol derived from the provided SPDL file.\n\n### Protocol Name: Otway-Rees Protocol\n\n#### Overview:\nThe Otway-Rees protocol provides a means for two parties to establish a shared session key securely. It relies on the involvement of a trusted third party (often referred to as a Key Distribution Center, or KDC) to mediate between the parties during the key establishment process.\n\n#### Participants:\n1. **Initiator (I)**: The party that wants to initiate the communication and obtain a session key.\n2. **Responder (R)**: The party that the initiator wants to communicate with and also requires the session key.\n3. **Server (S)**: The trusted third party that assists in the generation and distribution of the session key.\n\n#### Key Components:\n- **Nonces**: Randomly generated values (Ni for the initiator and Nr for the responder) are used to ensure freshness and to protect against replay attacks.\n- **Session Key (Kir)**: A secret key shared between the initiator and responder for secure communication.\n- **Tickets (T1 and T2)**: Encrypted messages used to associate the session key with the respective parties.\n\n#### Protocol Steps:\n1. **Step 1 (Initiation)**: The initiator (I) generates a nonce (Ni) and a message (M) and sends a request to the responder (R) with these components encrypted with a key known to the server (k(I, S)). The message includes the nonce, message information, and the identities of the participants.\n\n2. **Step 2 (Key Distribution)**: The responder (R) receives the initiation request, decrypts it using its key with the server (k(R, S)), and generates its own nonce (Nr). It then sends a response to the server (S) containing its nonce, the original initiator\u2019s message, and the first ticket (T1) that facilitates the key establishment.\n\n3. **Step 3 (Confirmation)**: The server (S) forwards the necessary information back to the responder (R). After verifying the components in the message, it sends back to the initiator a confirmation message containing the session key (Kir) encrypted with the respective keys.\n\n4. **Step 4 (Session Key Establishment)**: Finally, the responder sends the session key back to the initiator, completing the key establishment process.\n\n#### Claims:\n- **Claim I1**: The initiator (I) claims to have received the secret session key (Kir).\n- **Claim I2**: The initiator (I) claims that the session is synchronized.\n- **Claim I3**: The initiator (I) claims freshness with respect to the session key (Kir).\n- **Claim R1**: The responder (R) claims to have received the secret session key (Kir).\n- **Claim R2**: The responder (R) claims that the session is synchronized.\n- **Claim R3**: The responder (R) claims freshness with respect to the session key (Kir).\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe Otway-Rees protocol successfully manages to establish a secure session key between two parties through a trusted intermediary, ensuring that both parties can communicate securely using the derived session key while protecting against interception and replay attacks.\n\nThis description can now be used to generate an SPDL file with additional context regarding its implementation, focusing on correct nonce handling, encrypted message structures, and the roles of each participant in the secure key establishment process."]]}, "SPDL-1/SR3.spdl": {"code": [[true, "hashfunction H;\nusertype Key;\n\nprotocol sr3(V,S)\n{\n\n\trole V\n\t{\n\t\tfresh Nv: Nonce; // V generates a fresh nonce\n\t\tfresh D: Ticket;  // V generates a fresh ticket\n\t\tsend_1(V,S,{D,Nv}k(V,S),H(Nv),V); // V sends the encrypted ticket and nonce to S\n\t\trecv_2(S,V,Nv,V); // V receives response from S expecting the nonce\n\n\t\tclaim_V1(V, Niagree); // Claim that V agrees with S\n\t\tclaim_V2(V, Secret, D); // Claim that D is a secret known to V\n\t\tclaim_V3(V, Secret, k(V,S)); // Claim that the session key is known to V\n\t\tclaim_V4(V, Nisynch); // Claim that V is synchronized with S\n\t\tclaim_V5(V, Secret, Nv); // Claim that Nv is a secret known to V\n\t}\n\n\trole S\n\t{\n\t\tvar D: Ticket; // S will hold the ticket received from V\n\t\tvar Nv: Nonce; // S will hold the nonce received from V\n\t\trecv_1(V,S,{D,Nv}k(V,S),H(Nv),V); // S receives the message from V\n\t\tsend_2(S,V,Nv,V); // S sends back the nonce to V\n\n\t\tclaim_S1(S, Niagree); // Claim that S agrees with V\n\t\tclaim_S2(S, Secret, D); // Claim that D is a secret known to S\n\t\tclaim_S3(S, Secret, k(V,S)); // Claim that the session key is known to S\n\t\tclaim_S4(S, Nisynch); // Claim that S is synchronized with V\n\t\tclaim_S5(S, Secret, Nv); // Claim that Nv is a secret known to S\n\t}\n\n}", "Sure!

The protocol utilizes nonces and tickets to ensure mutual authentication and maintain the integrity of the communication channel. \n\n#### Roles and Functions\n\n1. **Role V (Verifier)**:\n   - Initiates communication by generating a fresh nonce (`Nv`) and a ticket (`D`). \n   - Sends a message to S, which includes the encrypted ticket and nonce, a hash of the nonce, and its identity (V). This message is encrypted using a shared key `k(V,S)`, ensuring that only S can read the contents.\n   - Receives a response from S, which must confirm the nonce (`Nv`) sent initially.\n   - Claims various properties following the reception of the message:\n     - **Niagree**: Indicates agreement on the session initiation.\n     - **Secret**: A shared secret that is consistent with the expected security properties.\n     - **k(V,S)**: Validates the session key.\n     - **Nisynch**: Ensures synchronization of the session.\n     - **Secret with nonce**: Validates that the nonce shared is kept secret.\n\n2. **Role S (Server)**:\n   - Waits for a message from V, which contains an encrypted ticket and nonce, a hash of the nonce, and V's identity.\n   - Processes the incoming message and sends a response back to V, echoing the nonce to maintain synchronization.\n   - Claims similar properties as V to ensure the integrity of the communication:\n     - **Niagree**: Confirms session initiation agreement.\n     - **Secret**: Acknowledges the shared secret.\n     - **k(V,S)**: Validates the session key.\n     - **Nisynch**: Confirms that both parties are synchronized.\n     - **Secret with nonce**: Ensures that the nonce is kept confidential.\n\n#### Security Properties\n\nThe protocol aims to fulfill several security properties:\n\n- **Mutual Authentication**: Both parties can authenticate each other, confirming their identity through the exchanged nonces and the associated claims.\n- **Confidentiality**: The use of a shared session key (k(V,S)) and encryption protects the contents of the communication from unauthorized access.\n- **Freshness**: Nonces (`Nv` and `D`) are used to guarantee that old messages cannot be reused by an attacker (replay attacks).\n- **Synchronization**: The protocol ensures that both roles are in sync regarding the session states and the nonces exchanged.\n\nThis description provides an overview of the operations, roles, and security goals of the **sr3** protocol, which can be effectively used to create a corresponding SPDL file for Scyther tool evaluation."]]}, "SPDL-1/sts-mac.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# 1 \"sts-mac.cpp\"\n# 1 \"<command-line>\"\n# 1 \"sts-mac.cpp\"\n# 16 \"sts-mac.cpp\"\n# 1 \"common.h\" 1\n\n\n\n\n hashfunction prf, KDF;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhashfunction g, h;\n# 94 \"common.h\"\nhashfunction MAC;\n\n# Notation: The hash functions are defined for use in the protocol.

Nonces are random values used to prevent replay attacks.\n\n2. **Session Key Derivation**: Once the relevant messages are exchanged and verified, both parties compute a session key using a key derivation function (KDF) based on the exchanged nonces and their generated tickets.\n\n3. **Message Exchange**:\n   - **Initiator Role (I)**:\n     - The initiator sends its generated value g(i) to the responder.\n     - Upon receiving the responder's ticket (Gr) combined with g(i) and protected with a MAC, the initiator processes this information. \n     - The initiator then sends a message back to the responder that contains its ticket and the MAC of the received ticket.\n  \n   - **Responder Role (R)**:\n     - The responder receives the initial message from the initiator and responds by sending its own ticket (Gi) with g(r), also protected by a MAC.\n     - Upon receiving the initiator's final message, the responder verifies the MAC and processes the information accordingly.\n\n4. **Claims**: Both roles make claims about having derived the same session key (SKR) from the key derivation functions, indicating mutual agreement on the session key as well as signaling that both parties are \"alive\" and have reached an agreement.\n\n5. **Security Goals**: The protocol aims to achieve:\n   - **Authentication**: Ensuring that both parties are who they claim to be.\n   - **Confidentiality**: Protecting the exchanged values from potential eavesdropping attacks.\n   - **Integrity**: Verifying that the messages have not been altered during transmission.\n   - **Weak Agreement**: Both parties agree on a session key derived from the exchanged values.\n\nThe above description frames the fundamental components and objectives of the `sts-mac` protocol, detailing the interactions between the initiator and responder while ensuring the security objectives are met through a structured exchange of messages, nonce usage, and cryptographic assurance mechanisms. \n\n### SPDL File Generation Guidelines\nUsing the contents of this description, one should be able to create a corresponding SPDL file.

Initiator (I) generates a fresh nonce \\(N1\\) to be used for the authentication.\n   - Responder (R) generates a fresh nonce \\(N2\\) for its own authentication.\n\n2. **Initial Message (I to R)**:\n   - The initiator sends a message to the responder that includes its identity \\(I\\) and the nonce \\(N1\\).\n\n3. **Response from Responder (R to I)**:\n   - Upon receiving the initial message, the responder sends back its identity \\(R\\) along with its fresh nonce \\(N2\\).\n\n4. **Session Key Creation**:\n   - The initiator computes a session key \\(k(I,S)\\) using its identity and the server's identity.\n   - The initiator then sends a secure message containing \\(I\\), \\(R\\), \\(N1\\), and \\(N2\\) encrypted with the session key \\(k(I,S)\\) to the responder.\n\n5. **Server Involvement**:\n   -

The protocol leverages cryptographic mechanisms, such as nonces and session keys, to provide confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged messages. \n\n### Roles\nThe Yahalom protocol consists of three roles, each defined with a specific sequence of message exchanges:\n\n1. **Initiator (I)**:\n    - Generates a fresh nonce \\(N_i\\) for uniqueness in the session.\n    - Sends the nonce to the responder \\(R\\) as part of the initiation message.\n    - Receives an encrypted message from the server \\(S\\), which includes the responder's identity, the session key \\(K_{ir}\\), and both nonces \\(N_i\\) and \\(N_r\\).\n    - Sends the second nonce \\(N_r\\) encrypted with the session key \\(K_{ir}\\) to the responder.\n    - Claims the session key \\(K_{ir}\\) as a secret upon successful completion of the exchange.\n\n2. **Responder (R)**:\n    - Generates another fresh nonce \\(N_r\\).\n    - Receives the initiation message from the initiator \\(I\\) containing \\(N_i\\).\n    - Sends an encrypted message to the server \\(S\\) that contains the initiator's identity, nonce \\(N_i\\), and its newly generated nonce \\(N_r\\).\n    - Receives an encrypted response from the server which includes the initiator's identity and the session key \\(K_{ir}\\).\n    - Claims the session key \\(K_{ir}\\) as a secret after successfully completing the exchange.\n\n3. **Server (S)**:\n    - Generates a fresh session key \\(K_{ir}\\).\n    - Receives the message from the responder \\(R\\), containing the initiator's identity and the nonces.\n    - Constructs a response that includes the session key and both nonces, encrypting this information and sending it back to the initiator and also returns a part of the response to the responder.\n    - Claims the received nonces \\(N_i\\) and \\(N_r\\) as secrets.\n\n### Message Flow\n- Message 1: \\(I \\rightarrow R: I, N_i\\) (Initiator sends nonce to Responder)\n- Message 2: \\(R \\rightarrow S: R, \\{I, N_i, N_r\\}_{k(R,S)}\\) (Responder forwards data to Server)\n- Message 3: \\(S \\rightarrow I: \\{R, K_{ir}, N_i, N_r\\}_{k(I,S)}, T\\) (Server sends back encrypted data including keys)\n- Message 4: \\(I \\rightarrow R: T, \\{N_r\\}_{K_{ir}}\\) (Initiator sends data to Responder)\n\n### Claims\n- The initiator claims that it has obtained the session key: \\(claim\\_I1(I, Secret, K_{ir})\\).\n- The responder claims that it has obtained the session key: \\(claim\\_R1(R, Secret, K_{ir})\\).\n- The server claims the secrecy of the nonces \\(N_i\\) and \\(N_r\\): \\(claim(S, Secret, N_i)\\) and \\(claim(S, Secret, N_r)\\).\n\n### Security Guarantees\nThe Yahalom protocol provides:\n- Confidentiality: Nonces and session keys are kept secret from unauthorized parties through encryption.\n- Authentication: Involves mutual authentication of the initiator and responder, as both need to prove the possession of shared secrets.\n\nThis protocol description can be used to regenerate the SPDL file that can be executed by the Scyther tool for security analysis.\n\n--- \n\nThis description provides a comprehensive overview of the Yahalom protocol, outlining its purpose, roles, message flows, and the security guarantees it aims to achieve.

Below is a detailed description of the protocol extracted from the SPDL file, along with an explanation of the roles and the flow of messages.\n\n### Protocol Description: Two-Move Diffie-Hellman ISO-9798-3 Adaptation\n\n#### Overview\nThis protocol is a variant of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism which allows two parties to establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This version does not employ digital signatures but instead uses pseudo-random functions (`h1`, `g1`, `g2`) to derive values. The protocol ensures secure key derivation through the exchange of nonces and tickets.\n\n#### Hash Functions\nThe protocol employs the following hash functions:\n- `h1`, `h2`: Used for hashing values during the protocol execution.\n- `g1`, `g2`: Used for generating unique representations of nonces and tickets.\n\n#### Protocol Components\n1. **Roles**: The protocol consists of two entities:\n   - **Initiator (I)**: The party that initiates the protocol.\n   - **Responder (R)**: The party that responds to the initiator.\n\n2. **Messages**:\n   - Messages between parties are exchanged in the form of function calls and involve sending various data types including nonces and tickets.\n\n#### Role Descriptions\n\n##### Initiator (I)\n1. **Fresh Nonce Generation**: The initiator generates a new random nonce `x`.\n2. **Compromise Notification**: The initiator sends a compromise message with `x` to itself.\n3. **First Message**: It sends a message to the responder containing:\n   - The computed value `g1(x)`.\n   - The identifier of the responder `R`.\n   - A signed version of the values for integrity.\n4. **Receive Message**: It receives a message from the responder, which contains:\n   - The value `beta` (from the responder) and the nonce `i`.\n   - A signature for integrity verification.\n5. **Final Message**: The initiator sends a final message containing:\n   - The hashed value derived from `g2(beta, x)`.\n\n6. **Claim**: The initiator claims the secret key `SKR` to be `g2(beta, x)`.\n\n##### Responder (R)\n1. **Fresh Nonce Generation**: The responder generates a new random nonce `y` and another nonce `i`.\n2. **Compromise Notification**: The responder sends a compromise message to itself with `y` and `i`.\n3. **Receive First Message**: It receives a message from the initiator containing:\n   - Alpha (ticket) and responder's identifier `R`.\n   - A signature for integrity verification.\n4. **Second Message**: The responder sends back:\n   - The received alpha,\n   - The computed value `g1(y)`,\n   - Nonce `i`, and\n   - A signed version of the values for integrity.\n5. **Final Verification**: The responder receives the hashed value from the initiator, which allows it to confirm the integrity of the exchange.\n\n6. **Claim**: The responder claims the secret key `SKR` to be `g2(alpha, y)`.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis protocol ensures that both parties can securely derive a shared key using prior exchanged nonces and ticketed messages. The usage of pseudo-random functions, instead of signatures, helps in ensuring that the protocol remains efficient while maintaining a level of security against impersonation and replay attacks.\n\n### SPDL Generation\nUsing the above-provided description, one can generate the corresponding SPDL file as presented in the original input.

Below is a textual description of the protocol, which outlines its key components, steps, roles, and functions. This description should aid in generating a corresponding SPDL file that can be executed by Scyther.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: HMQV Two-Pass Version\n\n**1. Overview:**\nThe HMQV (Hashed MQV) protocol is a key agreement protocol that allows two parties to securely establish a shared secret key. This implementation focuses on a two-pass mechanism, enabling both parties to complete the key exchange securely and efficiently.\n\n**2. Cryptographic Functions:**\n- **Hash Functions:** The protocol employs a variety of hash functions (`h1`, `h2`, `gexp`, `exp`, `KDF`, and `H`) for generating keys and handling cryptographic operations.\n- **Addition and Multiplication:** The protocol also defines hash-based functions for addition and multiplication (`add`, `mult`), simulating mathematical operations on public values.\n\n**3. Role Definitions:**\nThe main protocol consists of two roles: `I` and `R`, which represent the two parties involved in the key exchange.\n\n**4. Helper Protocols:**\n   - **Public Key Simulation (`@publickeys`)**: This helper protocol simulates the communication of public keys between the parties.\n   - **Exponentiation Simulation (`@exponentiation`)**: This protocol simulates the exponentiation operation needed for cryptographic calculations.\n   - **Addition/Multiplication (`@addmult`)**: It handles operations related to addition and multiplication of cryptographic values.\n   - **Key Swap (`@keyswap`)**: This protocol facilitates the key swapping process necessary for establishing a shared secret.\n\n**5. Protocol Steps:**\n- **Initialization:** Both roles start by generating fresh nonces. \n    - Role `I` generates nonce `x`.\n    - Role `R` generates nonce `y`.\n  \n- **Message Exchange:**\n  1. Role `I` sends a value (`gexp(x)`) computed from its nonce `x` to Role `R`.\n  2. Role `R` receives this value and responds with its own computed value (`gexp(y)`).\n  3. Role `I` receives the response from Role `R` and both roles calculate the session key using KDF (Key Derivation Function) based on received values and their respective secrets.\n\n**6. Security Claims:**\nBoth roles claim to have generated the same secret session key (`SKR`). This key is derived from the combination of the nonce, the exchanged messages, and the party-specific secret keys hashed together.\n\n---\n\nTo implement this description in a Scyther-compatible SPDL file, make sure to accurately define the roles, message flows, and cryptographic operations as per the structured layout provided in the initial SPDL text.\n\nThis description captures the essential components and flows of the HMQV two-pass protocol while being sufficiently detailed to facilitate the generation of an SPDL file for Scyther analysis."]]}, "SPDL-1/ikev2-mac.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# 1 \"ikev2-mac.cpp\"\n# 1 \"<command-line>\"\n# 1 \"ikev2-mac.cpp\"\n# 15 \"ikev2-mac.cpp\"\n# 1 \"common.h\" 1\n\n\n\n\n hashfunction prf, KDF;

Here\u2019s the description that captures the structure and functionality of the protocol effectively:\n\n### Protocol Description: IKEv2-MAC\n\nThe IKEv2 (Internet Key Exchange version 2) protocol is designed to establish a secure channel for communication over untrusted networks. The provided protocol implementation specifically concerns the MAC (Message Authentication Code) mechanism used to ensure data integrity and authenticity during the key exchange process.\n\n#### Components of the Protocol\n\n1. **Roles**:\n   - **DH (Diffie-Hellman)**:\n     - Responsible for exchanging the Diffie-Hellman values to generate a shared secret.\n     - The role initiates calls `DH1` and `DH2` to perform the necessary computations using hash functions on nonces.\n   \n   - **SWAP**:\n     - Performs a key derivation function using nonces and shared information to produce session identifiers (SPI).\n     - The role handles the calculation and exchanges of messages `SWAP1` and `SWAP2`.\n\n   - **E (Executability)**:\n     - Manages the overall execution process for the protocol, involving the generation and validation of MACs, as well as the establishment of security associations.\n     - It encapsulates interactions with both parties, ensuring that the claims made about running status and keys can be verified.\n\n   - **I (Initiator)**:\n     - Starts the IKEv2 exchange process by sending initial messages to establish parameters.\n     - Handles the reception of responses and verifies the establishment of security parameters.\n     - Claims security properties like Running, SKR (Session Key Responder), and others that confirm operational status and successful negotiations.\n\n   - **R (Responder)**:\n     - Receives initial messages from the Initiator and responds accordingly using the same parameters.\n     - Processes MACs to ensure message integrity and authenticity throughout the exchange.\n     - Claims analogous to the Initiator's claims, guaranteeing the same security assurances.\n\n2. **Messages and Claims**:\n   - The protocol messages include various components, including nonces, security associations, and other parameters, processed through cryptographic functions.\n   - Each role asserts claims at strategic points in the protocol, including:\n     - **Running Status**: Confirms that the protocol is actively engaged.\n     - **Session Key Extraction (SKR)**: Demonstrates that both parties can derive the same keys securely.\n     - **Alive** and **Weak Agreement** claims validate the continued participation and agreement on exchanged values.\n\n3. **Cryptographic Functions**:\n   - The protocol employs a variety of cryptographic primitives, including:\n     - Hash Functions (`g`, `h`, `MAC`): Used for message authentication and integrity checks.\n     - KDF (Key Derivation Function): To securely derive keys based on nonces and other transient information.\n     - PRF (Pseudo-Random Function): To provide additional security for key material generation.\n\n4. **Nonce Management**:\n   - Nonces (`Ni`, `Nr`, `SPIi`, `SPIr`) facilitate fresh session management and prevent replay attacks, ensuring that each session is unique and secure.\n\n#### Summary\n\nThe `ikev2-mac` protocol efficiently implements a secure key exchange mechanism incorporating standard cryptographic practices and a comprehensive claim structure that guarantees the authenticity, integrity, and agreed-upon state between the communicating parties. Each role has defined responsibilities and verifies mutual agreement, facilitating a secure network connection.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides an overview of how the protocol operates, emphasizing important roles, message exchanges, security claims, and cryptographic foundations essential for generating a compatible SPDL file for use with the Scyther tool."]]}, "SPDL-1/isoiec-9798-2-1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/*\n * Modeled from ISO/IEC 9798\n * Modeler: Cas Cremers, Dec. 2010\n *\n * symmetric\n * one-pass\n * unilateral\n *\n * Note: the identity B may be omitted, if\n *   (a) the environment disallows such attacks, or\n *   (b) a unidirectional key is used\n */\n\nprotocol @keysymm-21(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tvar T: Nonce; // Nonce used for freshness\n\t\tvar Text: Ticket; // Ticket representing user credentials or session info\n\n\t\t// A receives an encrypted message from B\n\t\trecv_!1(B,A, { T, A, Text }k(A,B) );\n\t\t// A sends an encrypted response back to B\n\t\tsend_!2(A,B, { T, A, Text }k(B,A) );\n\t}\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar T: Nonce; // Nonce for synchronization\n\t\tvar Text: Ticket; // Ticket received for authentication\n\n\t\t// B receives an encrypted message from A\n\t\trecv_!3(A,B, { T, B, Text }k(A,B) );\n\t\t// B sends an encrypted response back to A\n\t\tsend_!4(B,A, { T, B, Text }k(B,A) );\n\t}\n}\n\nprotocol isoiec-9798-2-1(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tfresh TNA: Nonce; // Fresh nonce for session initiation\n\t\tfresh Text1,Text2: Ticket; // Two tickets for authentication exchange\n\n\t\tclaim(A,Running,B,TNA,Text1); // Claim that A is actively running with B\n\t\t// A sends Text2 along with an encrypted message\n\t\tsend_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\t}\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar TNA: Nonce; // Nonce for session established by A\n\t\tvar Text1,Text2: Ticket; // Received tickets for authentication verification\n\n\t\t// B receives Text2 and an encrypted message from A\n\t\trecv_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\n\t\t// B makes claims based on received information\n\t\tclaim(B,Commit,A,TNA,Text1); // Claim that B has committed to A\n\t\tclaim(B,Alive); // Claim that B is alive and communicating\n\t\tclaim(B,Weakagree); // Claim that B agrees weakly with A's session\n\t}\n}", "To add proper notation and ensure the final SPDL code file is semantically correct and executable by Scyther, while keeping the original code unchanged, we can introduce comments that outline key aspects such as assumptions, security properties, and expected behaviors in the protocol.

It involves two parties, A and B, and is designed for secure communication by utilizing nonces and encrypted data exchanges. The protocol ensures both confidentiality and message integrity by employing symmetric encryption.\n\n#### Protocol Components\n\n1. **Parties Involved**:\n   - **A**: Initiating party.\n   - **B**: Responding party.\n\n2. **Messages**:\n   - **Nonce (T)**: A fresh random number used once to prevent replay attacks.\n   - **Ticket**: A piece of data that may be used to represent a session, identity, or authorization.\n\n#### Steps in the Protocol\n\n1. **First Protocol (`@keysymm-21`)**:\n   - **Role A**:\n     - Generates a nonce `T`.\n     - Receives an encrypted message from B containing the nonce `T`, A's identity, and a ticket `Text`.\n     - Sends an encrypted message back to B containing the nonce `T`, A's identity, and the same ticket `Text`, but encrypted with the symmetric key `k(B,A)`.\n\n   - **Role B**:\n     - Receives the encrypted message from A.\n     - Extracts the nonce, its own identity (B), and the ticket from the received message.\n     - Sends back an encrypted message to A containing the nonce, B's identity, and the ticket, encrypted using `k(B,A)`.\n\n2. **Second Protocol (`isoiec-9798-2-1`)**:\n   - **Role A**:\n     - Generates a fresh nonce `TNA` and two fresh tickets `Text1` and `Text2`.\n     - Claims a running state indicating an active session with B.\n     - Sends `Text2` and an encrypted message that includes `TNA`, B\u2019s identity, and `Text1` encrypted with `k(A,B)`.\n\n   - **Role B**:\n     - Receives the message containing `Text2` and the encrypted data.\n     - Claims a commitment to A along with the `TNA` and `Text1`.\n     - Claims the session is alive and asserts weak agreement on the session's authenticity.\n\n#### Security Properties\n- **Unilateral Authentication**: Only party A is authenticated to B.\n- **Confidentiality**: Messages are encrypted using symmetric keys derived from the identities of the parties, ensuring that onlookers cannot read the content.\n- **Integrity**: The use of nonces and encrypted messages ensures that the content has not been altered.\n- **Freshness**: Nonces guarantee session uniqueness, protecting against replay attacks.\n\n#### Note\nThe protocol assumes a secure environment where the identity of the parties is either implicitly trusted or additionally verified through mechanisms not specified in this file, adhering to possible assumptions regarding identity management and replay attacks.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis specification captures the essence of the symmetric, one-pass, unilateral authentication protocols based on ISO/IEC 9798.

This description can be helpful for generating the corresponding SPDL file that can be run by Scyther:\n\n---\n\n### KEA+ Protocol Description\n\n**Overview:**\nThe KEA+ (Key Exchange Algorithm Plus) protocol is an authenticated key exchange protocol that ensures secure communication between two parties, denoted as Initiator (I) and Responder (R). It leverages a combination of hash functions and public key cryptography to derive a shared secret. The protocol is designed to be robust against specific attacks, particularly when only the ephemeral keys are revealed.\n\n**Key Components:**\n1. **Roles:**\n   - **Initiator (I):** The party that initiates the key exchange.\n   - **Responder (R):** The party that responds to the initiator.\n\n2. **Variables:**\n   - **Nonces:** `x` (generated by I) and `y` (generated by R) are used to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks.\n   - **Tickets:** `alpha` and `beta` serve as transient values required for the protocol's internal operations.\n\n3. **Hash Functions:**\n   - **h1, h2:** Functions used to generate cryptographic hashes.\n   - **g1, g2:** Functions that represent encryption or commitment operations, typically using public keys.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n1. **Initiation by I:**\n   - I generates a fresh nonce `x` and sends it (Compromise message) to itself.\n   - I computes `g1(x)` and sends this value to R.\n   - I then awaits a response from R containing a ticket `beta`.\n\n2. **Operation at R:**\n   - R receives the `g1(x)` from I and sends its own generated nonce `y` back to I after processing.\n   - R sends `g1(y)` back to I and awaits further confirmation.\n\n3. **Completion and Claim:**\n   - Both parties complete their respective operations, where they exchange tickets and establish claims about the shared secret. \n   - The shared secret is confirmed through the hashing of the respective values using the hash function `h1`, producing the same key for both parties.\n\n**Security Claims:**\n- The protocol claims that the derived secret (SKR) from both sides matches if no significant adversarial manipulation occurs. The protocol remains secure as long as ephemeral keys are not permanently compromised and input to the hash function is not leaked.\n\n**Use of Helper Protocols:**\n- The protocol also introduces helper protocols (`@publickeys` and `@exponentiation`) that help facilitate the communication of public keys and the exponentiation of values, respectively. These are essential for maintaining the equivalence of public keys for pair computations.\n\n**Security Analysis:**\n- The protocol has been analyzed for potential attacks and is considered secure under defined constraints.

It incorporates measures for authentication to ensure that both parties are legitimate and allows them to establish a shared secret key.\n\n### Key Elements:\n1. **Hash Functions**:\n   - **h1, h2**: These are cryptographic hash functions used in the protocol for generating hashes of messages and keys.\n   - **p**: This is an exponentiation operator modeled through a one-way function, ensuring that the computation of such values is secure and prevents easy reverse engineering.\n\n2. **Constants**:\n   - **g**: A constant generator used in the exponentiation process to derive keys.\n\n3. **Helper Protocols**: \n   - **@publickeys**: This is a helper protocol that simulates the public knowledge of public keys, crucial for deriving shared secret keys based on public key cryptography.\n   - **@exponentiation**: This helper protocol defines the security relationships utilizing the properties of exponentiation, allowing different roles (RA, RB, RC) to communicate securely by exchanging tickets.\n\n4. **Roles**:\n   - Each role within the protocol (I for Initiator, R for Responder) is defined with specific actions, such as sending and receiving messages and performing cryptographic operations.\n\n### Security Claims:\n- Both the initiator and responder assert claims that they possess the shared secret key (SKR) at the end of the protocol execution. This verification of claimed shared keys highlights the protocol\u2019s emphasis on authenticated key exchange.\n\n### Interaction Flow:\n- The initiator sends a nonce (eskI) encrypted with a public key to the responder to initiate the session.\n- The responder, upon receiving the initiator's nonce, responds with its own nonce (eskR) encrypted with its public key.\n- After the exchange of these nonces, both parties derive the shared secret key using the received data and respective secret keys, affirming authentication.\n\n### Attack Analysis:\n- The protocol is displayed with potential vulnerabilities, specifically regarding state-reveal attacks, indicating that it is crucial to analyze the interaction state between roles for assessing the security guarantees effectively.\n\n### Overall Significance:\nThe NAXOS protocol's design emphasizes strong security features in the authenticated key exchange domain. It serves as a critical example in evaluating security protocols against possible attacks. By constructing such detailed specifications using SPDL, one can simulate and assess the security properties through tools such as Scyther.\n\nThis structured description can be fed into a formal verification tool to confirm the SPDL implementation of the NAXOS protocol and assess its security against various adversarial models."]]}, "SPDL-1/nsl3.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/* \n * Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol\n */\n\n// The protocol description\n\nprotocol nsl3(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tfresh ni: Nonce;  // Nonce generated by initiator I\n\t\tvar nr: Nonce;    // Nonce received from responder R\n\n\t\tsend_1(I,R, {I,ni}pk(R) ); // I sends its identity and nonce ni encrypted with R's public key\n\t\trecv_2(R,I, {ni,nr,R}pk(I) ); // I receives a message containing ni, nr, and R's identity\n        \n\t\tsend_3(I,R, {nr}pk(R) ); // I sends back the nonce nr encrypted with R's public key\n\n\t\t// Claims made by I based on the protocol execution\n\t\tclaim_i1(I,Secret,ni);   // I claims to have established a secret with ni\n\t\tclaim_i2(I,Secret,nr);   // I claims to have established a secret with nr\n\t\tclaim_i3(I,Niagree);      // I claims agreement on the nonce\n\t\tclaim_i4(I,Nisynch);      // I claims synchronization\n\t}\t\n\t\n\trole R\n\t{\n\t\tvar ni: Nonce;            // Nonce received from initiator I\n\t\tfresh nr: Nonce;         // Nonce generated by responder R\n\n\t\trecv_1(I,R, {I,ni}pk(R) ); // R receives I's identity and nonce ni encrypted with R's public key\n\t\tsend_2(R,I, {ni,nr,R}pk(I) ); // R sends back I's nonce ni, its own nonce nr, and its identity encrypted with I's public key\n\t\trecv_3(I,R, {nr}pk(R) ); // R receives nonce nr encrypted with R's public key\n\n\t\t// Claims made by R based on the protocol execution\n\t\tclaim_r1(R,Secret,ni);   // R claims to have established a secret with ni\n\t\tclaim_r2(R,Secret,nr);   // R claims to have established a secret with nr\n\t\tclaim_r3(R,Niagree);      // R claims agreement on the nonce\n\t\tclaim_r4(R,Nisynch);      // R claims synchronization\n\t}\n}", "To add notations to the provided SPDL file for the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol while ensuring the original code remains unchanged and correct for Scyther, I will include comments to explain the roles, messages, and claims.

The protocol utilizes nonce values and hash functions to ensure freshness and authenticity, while a helper protocol handles a mathematical abstraction involving exponentiation.\n\n#### Participants\n- **Initiator (I)**: The party that initiates the communication by sending the first message.\n- **Responder (R)**: The party that responds to the initiator's message and participates in key generation.\n\n#### Steps of the Protocol\n1. **Initialization**: At the beginning of the protocol, both parties generate fresh nonce values to ensure the security of their communications.\n   \n2. **Message Exchange**:\n   - **Step 1**: The initiator (I) sends a message to the responder (R) containing its identity, a nonce (s), and the hash of its secret (x) passed through a hash function (g1).\n   - **Step 2**: The responder (R) receives the first message, verifies the nonce, and sends back a response containing its own nonce (y), a ticket derived from (R, s, g1(y)) and a hash function (g1), encrypted with Responders's private key (sk(R)).\n   - **Step 3**: The initiator (I) processes R's response, unreels the necessary information, then responds back to R with a message that contains its identity, the nonce (s), and the encrypted ticket combining both party's identities and nonces, encrypted with Initiator's private key (sk(I)).\n\n3. **Key Generation**: \n   - Upon completion of the message exchange, both parties can compute a shared secret key:\n     - **For Initiator (I)**: g2(beta, x)\n     - **For Responder (R)**: g2(alpha, y)\n\n#### Claims\n- **Claims of the Initiator (I)**:\n  - The initiator claims the session identifier (SID) as fresh.\n  - The initiator claims the shared secret key (SKR) as g2(beta, x).\n  \n- **Claims of the Responder (R)**:\n  - The responder claims the session identifier (SID) as fresh.\n  - The responder claims the shared secret key (SKR) as g2(alpha, y).\n\n#### Security Features\n- **Freshness**: The use of nonce values ensures that each session is unique and protects against replay attacks.\n- **Confidentiality**: The messages exchanged between I and R are encrypted; hence, unauthorized parties cannot read the contents.\n- **Authenticity**: The use of ticketing and signing with private keys (sk(I) and sk(R)) helps to authenticate the involved parties.\n\n#### Helper Protocol\n- The helper protocol `@exponentiation(RA)` is defined to represent the mathematical operation `g^ab = g^ba` applicable in the Diffie-Hellman context, facilitating the correct computation of shared secrets.\n\n---\n\nThis description outlines the structure and function of the Two-move Diffie-Hellman protocol, providing all the necessary details for someone to design and implement the described protocol in SPDL format suitable for Scyther analysis."]]}, "SPDL-1/skeme-basic.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# 1 \"skeme-basic.cpp\"\n# 1 \"<command-line>\"\n# 1 \"skeme-basic.cpp\"\n# 21 \"skeme-basic.cpp\"\n# 1 \"common.h\" 1\n\n\n\n\n hashfunction prf, KDF;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhashfunction g, h;\n# 97 \"common.h\"\nprotocol @oracle (DH, SWAP) {\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n role DH {\n  var i, r: Nonce;\n\n  recv_!DH1( DH, DH, h(g(r),i) );  // DH role receiving message DH1\n  send_!DH2( DH, DH, h(g(i),r) );  // DH role sending message DH2\n }\n\n\n\n\n role SWAP {\n  var i, r, Ni, Nr: Nonce;\n# 150 \"common.h\"\n  recv_!SWAP1( SWAP, SWAP, KDF(h(g(r),i)) );  // SWAP role receiving message SWAP1\n  send_!SWAP2( SWAP, SWAP, KDF(h(g(i),r)) );  // SWAP role sending message SWAP2\n\n }\n\n\n}\n# 22 \"skeme-basic.cpp\" 2\n\n\n\n\nprotocol skeme-basic(I, R)\n{\n role I {\n  fresh i, Ni: Nonce;  // Initiator generates fresh nonces\n  var Nr: Nonce;  // Variable for responder's nonce\n  var Gr: Ticket;  // Variable for the ticket from responder\n\n  send_1( I, R, {I, Ni}pk(R), g(i) );  // I sends the first message\n  recv_2( R, I, {Nr}pk(I), Gr, prf(prf(Ni,Nr), g(i), Gr, R, I) );  // I receives second message\n  send_3( I, R, prf(prf(Ni,Nr), Gr, g(i), I, R) );  // I sends the third message\n\n\n  claim( I, SKR, KDF(h(Gr,i)) );  // Claiming session key SKR\n\n  claim( I, Alive );  // Claiming that the initiator is alive\n  claim( I, Weakagree );  // Claiming weak agreement\n\n }\n\n role R {\n  fresh r, Nr: Nonce;  // Responder generates fresh nonces\n  var Ni: Nonce;  // Variable for initiator's nonce\n  var Gi: Ticket;  // Variable for the ticket from initiator\n\n  recv_1( I, R, {I, Ni}pk(R), Gi );  // R receives the first message\n  send_2( R, I, {Nr}pk(I), g(r), prf(prf(Ni,Nr), Gi, g(r), R, I) );  // R sends the second message\n  recv_3( I, R, prf(prf(Ni,Nr), g(r), Gi, I, R) );  // R receives the third message\n\n\n  claim( R, SKR, KDF(h(Gi,r)) );  // Claiming session key SKR\n\n  claim( R, Alive );  // Claiming that the responder is alive\n  claim( R, Weakagree );  // Claiming weak agreement\n\n }\n}", "Sure!

The protocol employs techniques of Diffie-Hellman key exchanges and uses nonce values to ensure freshness and security during the exchange.\n\n#### Components of the Protocol\n\n1. **Roles**: There are two main roles defined in this protocol:\n   - **Initiator (I)**: The party that initiates the key exchange.\n   - **Responder (R)**: The party that responds to the key exchange request from the Initiator.\n\n2. **Nonces**: Each role generates its own nonce to ensure the security and uniqueness of each communication session. \n   - `Ni`: Nonce generated by the Initiator (I).\n   - `Nr`: Nonce generated by the Responder (R).\n   - `i`: An additional nonce used in the protocol.\n\n3. **Tickets**: \n   - A ticket (`Gr` for the Initiator and `Gi` for the Responder) is used to ensure that the parties can validate each other's identities and previous communications.\n\n4. **Hash Functions**: The protocol utilizes two primary hash functions:\n   - `g`: A generic hash function utilized within the protocol.\n   - `h`, `prf`: Additional hash functions used for key derivation and generating pseudorandom functions.\n\n5. **Key Derivation Function (KDF)**: This function is applied to derived keys to ensure they are in a usable format for encryption and decryption processes.\n\n#### Steps of the Protocol\n\n1. **Initiator I sends a message to Responder R**:\n   - It includes its identity and its nonce, encrypted with a key derived from Responder R's public key.\n   - It also sends the result of the hash function `g(i)`.\n\n2. **Responder R responds to Initiator I**:\n   - It encrypts its own nonce along with a ticket `Gi`, and sends this information back to Initiator I, using a secret key derived from the public key of Initiator I.\n   - It also incorporates the pseudorandom function `prf`, which combines the nonces and ticket information for enhanced security.\n\n3. **Initiator I finalizes the exchange**:\n   - Initiator I sends another message containing the result of the pseudorandom function, which is a combination of both nonces, the ticket, and identities.\n\n4. **Claims**: \n   - Both parties claim possession of the session key `SKR` which is derived from their respective computed values. \n   - Each party asserts its own existence and a weak agreement on the established session key.\n\n\n#### Security Claims\n\n- **SKR (Session Key Recovery)**: Each role asserts that it can derive the same session key using its information and exchanges.\n- **Alive**: Both parties claim to be active participants and have successfully engaged in the protocol.\n- **Weak Agreement**: Both parties affirm that they have established a common session key and thus have a weak agreement on the exchanged secret.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThis SKEME protocol provides a foundation for secure communication between two parties, employing nonce values and public key cryptography to protect against various attacks while establishing a shared session key. By ensuring freshness through the use of nonces and employing robust hash functions, the protocol strives to promote both privacy and integrity in the exchanges. \n\nThis description serves as the basis for generating the corresponding SPDL file applicable for implementation and analysis using the Scyther tool."]]}}
