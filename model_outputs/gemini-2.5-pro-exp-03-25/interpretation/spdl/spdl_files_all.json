Based on the provided SPDL file, here is a detailed description of the **Lowe modified BAN concrete Andrew Secure RPC** protocol. This description is structured to be clear and comprehensive, allowing for the recreation of the original Scyther model.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: Lowe Modified BAN Concrete Andrew Secure RPC\n\n#### 1. Overview\n\nThis protocol is a variant of the Andrew Secure RPC protocol, modified by Gavin Lowe to address certain vulnerabilities. Its primary goal is for two principals, an Initiator (`I`) and a Responder (`R`), to securely establish a fresh symmetric session key (`kir`). The model is based on the description found in the SPORE library.\n\n#### 2. Principals and Keys\n\n*   **Principals:**\n    *   `I`: The Initiator of the protocol.\n    *   `R`: The Responder.\n\n*   **Keys:**\n    *   **Long-Term Key:** `I` and `R` are assumed to pre-share a long-term symmetric key. In the Scyther model, this is represented by the function `k(principal1, principal2)`.\n    *   **Session Key:** The protocol establishes a new, temporary session key of a custom type `SessionKey`, denoted as `kir`.\n\n*   **Modeling Note:** The Scyther model treats the long-term key as potentially asymmetric, meaning `k(I,R)` is not automatically considered the same as `k(R,I)`. This is a limitation of the modeling language and might prevent the discovery of attacks that rely on the key's symmetry.\n\n#### 3. Protocol Data\n\n*   **Nonces:** The protocol uses nonces to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks.\n    *   `ni`: A nonce generated by the Initiator `I`.\n    *   `nr`: A nonce generated by the Responder `R`.\n*   **Custom Data Types:**\n    *   `SessionKey`: A user-defined type to distinguish session keys from other data.\n\n#### 4. Protocol Steps\n\nThe protocol consists of a four-message exchange to establish and confirm the session key.\n\n**Message 1: `I -> R: I, ni`**\n*   **Action:** The Initiator `I` begins the protocol by generating a fresh nonce, `ni`.\n*   **Content:** `I` sends its own identity `I` and the fresh nonce `ni` to the Responder `R` in plaintext.\n\n**Message 2: `R -> I: {ni, kir, R}k(I,R)`**\n*   **Action:** Upon receiving the first message, the Responder `R` generates a fresh session key, `kir`.\n*   **Content:** `R` creates a message containing the nonce it received (`ni`), the new session key (`kir`), and its own identity (`R`). This entire payload is encrypted using the long-term key shared with `I`, `k(I,R)`.\n*   **Purpose:** This message proves to `I` that it is communicating with the legitimate `R` (who knows `k(I,R)`) and securely delivers the new session key.\n\n**Message 3: `I -> R: {ni}kir`**\n*   **Action:** The Initiator `I` receives message 2 and decrypts it using `k(I,R)` to retrieve the session key `kir`.\n*   **Content:** To confirm that it has successfully received the key, `I` encrypts the original nonce `ni` using the newly established session key `kir`.\n*   **Purpose:** This serves as a key confirmation message to `R`, proving that `I` now possesses `kir`. `R` can decrypt this message and verify that the nonce `ni` is the one it received in the first step.\n\n**Message 4: `R -> I: nr`**\n*   **Action:** After successfully verifying message 3, the Responder `R` generates its own fresh nonce, `nr`.\n*   **Content:** `R` sends the nonce `nr` to `I` in plaintext.\n*   **Modeling Note:** In this Scyther model, the Initiator `I` is specified to receive this message *after* its security claims have been made. This is a deliberate modeling choice to prevent Scyther from finding a trivial synchronization attack. Since `nr` is a fresh, unauthenticated value, an attacker could otherwise easily forge this message to satisfy the `Nisynch` claim prematurely.\n\n#### 5. Security Claims (Security Goals)\n\nBoth the Initiator and Responder verify several security properties at the end of their respective runs.\n\nFor both roles (`I` and `R`):\n\n1.  **Secrecy of the Session Key:**\n    *   **Claim:** `Secret(kir)`\n    *   **Description:** Both `I` and `R` claim that the established session key `kir` remains a secret between them and is not known to any unauthorized party.\n\n2.  **Non-injective Synchronization:**\n    *   **Claim:** `Nisynch`\n    *   **Description:** Both `I` and `R` claim that their protocol run is synchronized with a run of the other party. This ensures that if an honest principal completes the protocol, they have been in communication with another honest principal who has also engaged in the protocol.\n\n3.  **Freshness of the Session Key (Custom Claim):**\n    *   **Claim:** `Empty((Fresh, kir))`\n    *   **Description:** This is a custom claim using a constant function `Fresh`. It asserts that the pair `(Fresh, kir)` is not a fact known to the adversary. This provides a strong guarantee that the session key `kir` was freshly generated for the current session and has not been reused or compromised from a previous session."]]}, "SPDL-1/tls-BM-1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/*\n * This is a model of a version of the TLS protocol as modeled in\n * Boyd, Mathuria \"Protocols for Authentication and key establishment\"\n *\n * It's a very simplified form.\n */\n\n// We first declare the types of the identifiers we use.\nusertype Nonce, Agent, PublicKey, PrivateKey;\n\n// The hash function is modelled as a one-way function.

As a Scyther expert, I can provide a detailed description of the protocol specified in the SPDL file. This description is structured to be clear and precise, allowing for the recreation of the original SPDL code.\n\n### Protocol Description: A Simplified TLS Model (Boyd & Mathuria)\n\nThis protocol models a simplified version of the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol, focusing on mutual authentication and session key establishment between two parties.\n\n**1. Participants**\n\n*   **A**: The initiator of the protocol (e.g., Alice).\n*   **B**: The responder (e.g., Bob).\n\n**2. Cryptographic Primitives**\n\nThe protocol relies on the following standard cryptographic functions:\n\n*   **Public/Private Key Cryptography**: Each agent possesses a long-term public/private key pair, denoted as `(pk(Agent), sk(Agent))`. These are used for asymmetric encryption and digital signatures.\n*   **Cryptographic Hash Function**: A one-way hash function, denoted as `hash(...)`.\n\n**3. Protocol Goal**\n\nThe primary goal is for `A` and `B` to mutually authenticate each other and securely establish a shared session key.\n\n**4. Protocol Steps**\n\nThe protocol consists of four messages exchanged between the initiator `A` and the responder `B`.\n\n**Step 1: A -> B (Nonce Exchange)**\n\n*   `A` generates a fresh, unpredictable nonce, `na`.\n*   `A` sends `na` to `B`.\n    *   **Message:** `na`\n\n**Step 2: B -> A (Nonce Exchange)**\n\n*   Upon receiving `na`, `B` generates his own fresh, unpredictable nonce, `nb`.\n*   `B` sends `nb` to `A`.\n    *   **Message:** `nb`\n\n**Step 3: A -> B (Key Exchange and Authentication)**\n\nAfter receiving `nb`, `A` constructs and sends a complex message with three parts to `B`.\n\n*   **Part 1: Encrypted Pre-Master Key.**\n    *   `A` generates a fresh secret value, the pre-master key `pmk`.\n    *   `A` encrypts `pmk` using `B`'s public key: `{pmk}pk(B)`.\n\n*   **Part 2: Initiator's Signature.**\n    *   `A` authenticates herself by creating a digital signature. She computes a hash of the two nonces (`na`, `nb`) and the encrypted pre-master key (Part 1).\n    *   She then signs this hash with her private key: `{hash(na, nb, {pmk}pk(B))}sk(A)`.\n\n*   **Part 3: Finished Message MAC.**\n    *   `A` derives a session key by hashing the `pmk`, `na`, and `nb`: `SessionKey = hash(pmk, na, nb)`.\n    *   `A` then creates a Message Authentication Code (MAC) to protect the integrity of the previous parts of the message. She computes a hash of the concatenated Part 1 and Part 2. This resulting hash is then \"encrypted\" (used as a MAC) with the `SessionKey`.\n    *   **MAC:** `{hash(Part1, Part2)}SessionKey`\n\n`A` sends these three parts concatenated to `B`.\n\n*   **Full Message:** `{pmk}pk(B), {hash(na, nb, {pmk}pk(B))}sk(A), {hash({pmk}pk(B), {hash(na, nb, {pmk}pk(B))}sk(A))}hash(pmk, na, nb)`\n\n**Step 4: B -> A (Confirmation)**\n\nUpon receiving Message 3, `B` validates it and sends a confirmation back to `A`.\n\n*   **B's actions:**\n    1.  Uses his private key `sk(B)` to decrypt the first part and retrieve `pmk`.\n    2.  Uses `A`'s public key `pk(A)` to verify the signature in the second part.\n    3.  Derives the same session key: `SessionKey = hash(pmk, na, nb)`.\n    4.  Verifies the MAC in the third part using the derived `SessionKey`.\n*   **Confirmation Message Construction:**\n    *   If all checks pass, `B` proves he has successfully processed the message and derived the key. He does this by creating a MAC over the *entire content of Message 3* that he received from `A`.\n    *   He uses the derived `SessionKey` for this MAC.\n\n`B` sends this final MAC to `A`.\n\n*   **Full Message:** `{[Message 3]}SessionKey` which is `{ {pmk}pk(B), {hash(na, nb, {pmk}pk(B))}sk(A), {hash({pmk}pk(B), {hash(na, nb, {pmk}pk(B))}sk(A))}hash(pmk, na, nb) }hash(pmk, na, nb)`\n\nUpon receiving this, `A` can verify it using her copy of the `SessionKey`, confirming that `B` is live and has correctly derived the key.\n\n**5. Security Claims**\n\nAt the end of a successful run, the following security properties should hold:\n\n*   **Secrecy**: Both `A` and `B` claim that the derived session key, `hash(pmk, na, nb)`, is a secret known only to them.\n*   **Synchronization (Nisynch)**: Both `A` and `B` claim that the protocol has run to completion correctly, and they are in agreement on the protocol flow and exchanged messages with each other for this specific session."]]}, "SPDL-1/denning-sacco-lowe.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# Lowe modified Denning-Sacco shared key\n#\n# Modelled after the description in the SPORE library\n# http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/denningSaccoLowe.html\n#\n# Note:\n# According to SPORE there are no attacks on this protocol.

Based on the provided SPDL file, here is a detailed description of the Lowe-modified Denning-Sacco protocol. This description is structured to allow for the unambiguous recreation of the original SPDL file.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: Lowe-Modified Denning-Sacco Shared Key\n\nThis protocol is Lowe's modification of the Denning-Sacco shared key protocol. Its primary goal is to establish a fresh, shared session key between two parties, an Initiator (`I`) and a Responder (`R`), with the help of a trusted third-party Server (`S`).\n\n#### 1. Participants and Roles\n\nThe protocol involves three distinct roles:\n\n*   **`I` (Initiator):** The party that initiates the protocol run to establish a session key with `R`.\n*   **`R` (Responder):** The party that communicates with `I`.\n*   **`S` (Server):** A trusted server that shares long-term keys with both `I` and `R` and is responsible for generating the session key.\n\n#### 2. Pre-assumptions and Setup\n\n*   **Long-Term Keys:**\n    *   The Initiator `I` and the Server `S` share a long-term symmetric key, denoted as `k(I,S)`.\n    *   The Responder `R` and the Server `S` share a long-term symmetric key, denoted as `k(R,S)`.\n*   **Functions:**\n    *   There is a publicly known pseudo-function named `dec`. In the protocol, it is applied to a nonce as a simple transformation (e.g., decrementing it).\n\n#### 3. Protocol Steps\n\nThe protocol proceeds in five message exchanges:\n\n**Message 1: `I -> S` (Session Request)**\n\nThe Initiator `I` starts the protocol by sending a request to the Server `S`. This message contains the identities of both the Initiator `I` and the intended Responder `R` in plaintext.\n\n*   **Content:** `I, R`\n\n**Message 2: `S -> I` (Key Distribution)**\n\nUpon receiving the request, the Server `S` performs the following actions:\n1.  Generates a **fresh** session key `Kir` for `I` and `R`.\n2.  Generates a **fresh** timestamp `T`.\n3.  Creates a \"ticket\" intended for `R`. This ticket contains the session key `Kir`, the initiator's identity `I`, and the timestamp `T`, all encrypted with the long-term key shared between `R` and `S`, `k(R,S)`.\n    *   Ticket for R: `{Kir, I, T}k(R,S)`\n4.  Sends a message to `I`, encrypted with the long-term key shared between `I` and `S`, `k(I,S)`. This message contains the responder's identity `R`, the fresh session key `Kir`, the timestamp `T`, and the ticket for `R`.\n\n*   **Content:** `{R, Kir, T, {Kir, I, T}k(R,S)}k(I,S)`\n\n**Message 3: `I -> R` (Ticket Forwarding)**\n\nThe Initiator `I` receives the message from `S`, decrypts it using `k(I,S)`, and extracts the session key `Kir` and the ticket. `I` then forwards the ticket to the Responder `R`.\n\n*   **Content:** `{Kir, I, T}k(R,S)`\n\n**Message 4: `R -> I` (Challenge)**\n\nThe Responder `R` receives the ticket from `I`.\n1.  `R` decrypts the ticket using its long-term key `k(R,S)` to obtain the session key `Kir` and the initiator's identity `I`.\n2.  `R` generates a **fresh** nonce `Nr`.\n3.  `R` sends a challenge to `I` by encrypting the nonce `Nr` with the newly acquired session key `Kir`.\n\n*   **Content:** `{Nr}Kir`\n\n**Message 5: `I -> R` (Response)**\n\nThe Initiator `I` receives the challenge from `R`.\n1.  `I` decrypts the message using the session key `Kir` to get the nonce `Nr`.\n2.  `I` applies the `dec` function to the nonce `Nr`.\n3.  `I` encrypts the transformed nonce and sends it back to `R` as a response, proving it possesses the session key `Kir`.\n\n*   **Content:** `{{Nr}dec}Kir`\n\nUpon receiving this message, `R` can decrypt it and verify that the contained value is indeed the result of applying the `dec` function to the original nonce `Nr`, thus authenticating `I`.\n\n#### 4. Security Claims (Goals)\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security properties, which are asserted within the roles:\n\n**For the Initiator `I`:**\n*   `Niagree`: Asserts non-injective agreement with the other party.\n*   `Nisynch`: Asserts non-injective synchronization, meaning the protocol run has been recently executed by the other party.\n*   `SKR, Kir`: Claims that `Kir` is a secure session key with the Responder.\n*   A custom claim `(Fresh, Kir)` asserts the freshness of the session key `Kir`.\n\n**For the Responder `R`:**\n*   `Niagree`: Asserts non-injective agreement.\n*   `Nisynch`: Asserts non-injective synchronization.\n*   `Secret, Kir`: Claims that the session key `Kir` is a secret known only to the intended parties.\n*   A custom claim `(Fresh, Kir)` asserts the freshness of the session key `Kir`."]]}, "SPDL-1/kaochow.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/*\n * The Kao-Chow Authentication Protocol v.1\n *\n * This protocol is a classic key agreement protocol that uses a trusted\n * third party (the server S) to establish a shared session key (kir)\n * between two parties, an initiator (I) and a responder (R).\n *\n * The annotations below clarify the protocol steps and the security\n * goals being verified by the claims.

Based on the provided SPDL file, here is a detailed description of the Kao-Chow Authentication protocol (v.1). This description is structured to be clear and precise enough to allow for the reconstruction of the original SPDL file.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: Kao-Chow Authentication v.1\n\nThis protocol is a classic key establishment protocol involving three parties, designed to securely establish a fresh session key between an Initiator and a Responder with the help of a trusted Server.\n\n#### 1. Participants and Roles\n\nThe protocol involves three distinct roles:\n*   **I**: The **Initiator** who wishes to establish a secure session with the Responder.\n*   **R**: The **Responder** who communicates with the Initiator.\n*   **S**: A trusted **Server** that shares long-term keys with both I and R and is responsible for generating the session key.\n\n#### 2. Pre-shared Information and Data Types\n\n*   **Long-term Keys**: It is assumed that the Initiator `I` and the Server `S` share a long-term symmetric key, denoted as `k(I,S)`. Similarly, the Responder `R` and the Server `S` share a long-term symmetric key `k(R,S)`.\n*   **Data Types**: The protocol defines a custom data type `SessionKey` for the keys established during a session.\n*   **Constants**: A constant function `Fresh` is defined, which will be used in a security claim to formally assert the freshness of the generated session key.\n\n#### 3. Protocol Execution Flow\n\nThe protocol consists of four distinct messages.\n\n**Step 1: Initiator to Server (Session Request)**\n\n*   **Action**: The Initiator `I` begins the protocol run. It generates a **fresh nonce `ni`**.\n*   **Message**: `I` sends a message to the Server `S` containing its own identity `I`, the identity of the intended Responder `R`, and its fresh nonce `ni`.\n*   **Format**: `I -> S: I, R, ni`\n\n**Step 2: Server to Responder (Key Distribution)**\n\n*   **Action**: Upon receiving the request, the Server `S` generates a **fresh session key `kir`** intended for `I` and `R`. It then constructs two encrypted tickets.\n*   **Message**: `S` sends a message to the Responder `R` containing two components:\n    1.  A ticket for `I`: The identities of `I` and `R`, `I`'s nonce `ni`, and the new session key `kir`, all encrypted with the long-term key `k(I,S)`.\n    2.  A ticket for `R`: The same information (identities of `I` and `R`, nonce `ni`, and session key `kir`), encrypted with the long-term key `k(R,S)`.\n*   **Format**: `S -> R: {I, R, ni, kir}k(I,S), {I, R, ni, kir}k(R,S)`\n\n**Step 3: Responder to Initiator (Key Forwarding and Challenge)**\n\n*   **Action**: The Responder `R` receives the message from `S`.\n    *   `R` decrypts the second component using its key `k(R,S)` to retrieve `I`'s identity, the nonce `ni`, and the session key `kir`.\n    *   `R` cannot decrypt the first component (the ticket for `I`), so it stores it in a temporary variable `T`.\n    *   `R` then generates its own **fresh nonce `nr`**.\n*   **Message**: `R` sends a message to `I` containing three components:\n    1.  The ticket `T` (which is `{I, R, ni, kir}k(I,S)`) that it received from `S`.\n    2.  `I`'s original nonce `ni`, encrypted with the new session key `kir`. This proves to `I` that `R` knows `kir`.\n    3.  `R`'s own fresh nonce `nr`, sent in plaintext.\n*   **Format**: `R -> I: {I, R, ni, kir}k(I,S), {ni}kir, nr`\n\n**Step 4: Initiator to Responder (Challenge Response)**\n\n*   **Action**: The Initiator `I` receives the message from `R`.\n    *   `I` decrypts the first component (the ticket) using its key `k(I,S)` to retrieve the session key `kir`. It verifies that the nonce `ni` inside matches the one it originally sent.\n    *   `I` then uses the newly acquired `kir` to decrypt the second component, `{ni}kir`, to further confirm that the sender possesses the correct session key.\n    *   `I` now needs to prove its own knowledge of `kir` to `R`.\n*   **Message**: `I` sends a message to `R` containing `R`'s nonce `nr`, encrypted with the session key `kir`.\n*   **Format**: `I -> R: {nr}kir`\n*   **Final Action for R**: Upon receiving this message, `R` decrypts it with `kir` and verifies that the nonce `nr` matches the one it sent in the previous step. If it matches, both `I` and `R` have successfully authenticated each other and now share the session key `kir`.\n\n#### 4. Security Claims (Verification Goals)\n\nThe following security properties are claimed and intended to be verified for both the Initiator and Responder roles.\n\n**For the Initiator `I`:**\n*   **`claim_I1 (I, Nisynch)`**: Claims non-injective synchronization. This asserts that if `I` completes a run of the protocol, it has done so with other principals who have been actively participating in their respective roles.\n*   **`claim_I2 (I, Niagree)`**: Claims non-injective agreement. This asserts that the values of the variables (`ni`, `nr`, `kir`) held by `I` at the end of the protocol match those held by the other participants.\n*   **`claim_I3 (I, Secret, kir)`**: Claims that the session key `kir` remains a secret shared only between `I` and `R`.\n*   **`claim_I4 (I, Empty, (Fresh,kir))`**: A formal claim asserting the freshness of the session key. It states that the term `(Fresh, kir)` cannot be derived by an attacker, meaning the key was not known before this protocol run.\n\n**For the Responder `R`:**\nThe claims for `R` are symmetric to those for `I`.\n*   **`claim_R1 (R, Nisynch)`**: Claims non-injective synchronization for the responder.\n*   **`claim_R2 (R, Niagree)`**: Claims non-injective agreement on the protocol data for the responder.\n*   **`claim_R3 (R, Secret, kir)`**: Claims the secrecy of the session key `kir` from `R`'s perspective.\n*   **`claim_R4 (R, Empty, (Fresh,kir))`**: Claims the freshness of the session key `kir` from `R`'s perspective."]]}, "SPDL-1/needham-schroeder.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# Needham Schroeder Public Key\n#\n# Modelled after the description in the SPORE library\n# http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/nspk.html\n#\n#\n# Note:\n# The modelling in SPORE includes a server to distribute the public keys\n# of the agents, this is not necessary and it allows for attacks against\n# synchronisation and agreement, because the keys that the server sends\n# out can be replayed.\n\nprotocol needhamschroederpk(I,R,S)\n{\n    role I\n    {\n        fresh Ni: Nonce;\n        var Nr: Nonce;\n\n        /* I requests R's public key from the trusted server S. */\n        send_1(I,S,(I,R));\n        /* I receives the public key of R, signed by S.

Based on your provided SPDL file, here is a detailed description of the Needham-Schroeder Public Key (NSPK) protocol. This description is structured to be clear and precise, enabling the recreation of the original SPDL file.\n\n### Protocol Description: Needham-Schroeder Public Key (`needhamschroederpk`)\n\nThis document describes the Needham-Schroeder Public Key (NSPK) protocol, designed for mutual authentication between two parties with the help of a trusted server.\n\n#### 1. Roles and Participants\n\nThe protocol involves three distinct roles:\n\n*   **`I` (Initiator):** The agent who wishes to initiate a secure communication session with the Responder.\n*   **`R` (Responder):** The agent who responds to the Initiator's request.\n*   **`S` (Server):** A trusted server that holds the public keys of all registered participants. Its role is to distribute these keys upon request.\n\n#### 2. Variables and Fresh Data\n\nEach role manages specific pieces of information:\n\n*   **Role `I` (Initiator):**\n    *   Generates a **fresh nonce `Ni`**. A nonce is a random number used once.\n    *   Declares a variable for a **nonce `Nr`**, which it expects to receive from the Responder.\n\n*   **Role `R` (Responder):**\n    *   Generates a **fresh nonce `Nr`**.\n    *   Declares a variable for a **nonce `Ni`**, which it expects to receive from the Initiator.\n\n*   **Role `S` (Server):**\n    *   This role is stateless; it does not generate any fresh data or maintain variables between sessions.\n\n#### 3. Protocol Execution Flow\n\nThe protocol consists of seven message exchanges. Note that the key distribution (steps 1-2 and 4-5) is interleaved with the authentication handshake (steps 3, 6-7).\n\n**Step 1: Initiator requests Responder's Public Key**\n*   **Action:** `send_1(I, S, (I, R))`\n*   **Description:** The Initiator `I` sends a message to the Server `S` containing a tuple of its own identity `I` and the Responder's identity `R`, requesting `R`'s public key.\n\n**Step 2: Server provides Responder's Public Key**\n*   **Action:** `recv_2(S, I, {pk(R), R}sk(S))`\n*   **Description:** The Server `S` responds to `I`. It sends a message containing the public key of `R` (`pk(R)`) and `R`'s identity. This message is signed with the server's private key (`sk(S)`) to prove its authenticity.\n\n**Step 3: Initiator contacts Responder**\n*   **Action:** `send_3(I, R, {Ni, I}pk(R))`\n*   **Description:** Having obtained `R`'s public key, the Initiator `I` sends its first message to `R`. The message contains its freshly generated nonce `Ni` and its own identity `I`. The entire message is encrypted with `R`'s public key (`pk(R)`).\n\n**Step 4: Responder requests Initiator's Public Key**\n*   **Action:** `send_4(R, S, (R, I))`\n*   **Description:** After receiving the message from `I`, the Responder `R` needs `I`'s public key to continue. It sends a message to the Server `S` containing a tuple of its own identity `R` and the Initiator's identity `I`.\n\n**Step 5: Server provides Initiator's Public Key**\n*   **Action:** `recv_5(S, R, {pk(I), I}sk(S))`\n*   **Description:** The Server `S` responds to `R` with a message containing the public key of `I` (`pk(I)`) and `I`'s identity, signed with the server's private key (`sk(S)`).\n\n**Step 6: Responder challenges the Initiator**\n*   **Action:** `send_6(R, I, {Ni, Nr}pk(I))`\n*   **Description:** The Responder `R` now has `I`'s public key. It sends a message to `I` containing the nonce it received (`Ni`) and its own new nonce `Nr`. The entire message is encrypted with `I`'s public key (`pk(I)`). Sending back `Ni` proves to `I` that `R` successfully decrypted Step 3.\n\n**Step 7: Initiator completes the handshake**\n*   **Action:** `send_7(I, R, {Nr}pk(R))`\n*   **Description:** The Initiator `I` receives and decrypts the message from `R`. It verifies that its original nonce `Ni` is present. To prove its identity and complete the protocol, it sends `R`'s nonce `Nr` back to `R`, encrypted with `R`'s public key (`pk(R)`).\n\n#### 4.

Here is a detailed description of the Otway-Rees protocol based on the provided SPDL file. This description is designed to be comprehensive enough to allow for the recreation of the original Scyther model.\n\n### Protocol: Otway-Rees\n\nThis protocol is a symmetric-key authentication and key-exchange protocol designed to establish a shared session key between two parties, an Initiator (`I`) and a Responder (`R`), with the help of a trusted third party, the Server (`S`).\n\n---\n\n### 1. Preliminaries and Setup\n\n#### Participants\nThe protocol involves three types of principals:\n*   **I**: The Initiator of the protocol.\n*   **R**: The Responder.\n*   **S**: A trusted authentication Server.\n\n#### Pre-shared Keys\nIt is assumed that before the protocol run, the server `S` shares a unique long-term symmetric key with each participant.\n*   `k(I,S)`: A long-term key shared between `I` and `S`.\n*   `k(R,S)`: A long-term key shared between `R` and `S`.\n\n#### Data Types\nThe protocol uses the following custom data types:\n*   **String**: Represents a session identifier.\n*   **SessionKey**: Represents the type of the key being established.\n\n---\n\n### 2. Protocol Roles and Message Exchange\n\nThe protocol consists of four messages exchanged between the three parties.\n\n#### Role: Initiator (I)\n\nThe Initiator `I` wants to establish a session key with the Responder `R`.\n\n1.  **Preparation:**\n    *   `I` generates a fresh nonce `Ni`.\n    *   `I` generates a fresh session identifier `M` of type `String`.\n\n2.  **Message 1 (I -> R):** `I` initiates the protocol by sending a message to `R`. The message is a tuple containing:\n    *   The session identifier `M`.\n    *   The identity of the initiator, `I`.\n    *   The identity of the responder, `R`.\n    *   An encrypted component intended for the server `S`. This component contains the tuple `{Ni, M, I, R}` encrypted with the long-term key `k(I,S)`.\n\n    The full message is: `M, I, R, {Ni, M, I, R}k(I,S)`\n\n3.  **Message 4 (R -> I):** After the server has processed the request, `I` expects to receive a message from `R`. This message is a tuple containing:\n    *   The session identifier `M`.\n    *   An encrypted component from the server. `I` decrypts this using its key `k(I,S)`. The decrypted content should be the tuple `{Ni, Kir}`, where `Ni` is its original nonce and `Kir` is the new session key. `I` verifies that the nonce `Ni` matches the one it sent.\n\n    The received message is: `M, {Ni, Kir}k(I,S)`\n\n#### Role: Responder (R)\n\nThe Responder `R` receives the request from `I` and communicates with the server `S` to establish the session key.\n\n1.  **Message 1 (I -> R):** `R` receives the initial message from `I`. `R` cannot decrypt the final component of this message. It treats it as an opaque ticket (`T1`).\n    *   The received message structure is `M, I, R, T1`.\n\n2.  **Preparation:**\n    *   `R` generates its own fresh nonce `Nr`.\n\n3.  **Message 2 (R -> S):** `R` forwards `I`'s request to the server `S` and appends its own request. The message is a tuple containing:\n    *   The session identifier `M`.\n    *   The identity of the initiator, `I`.\n    *   The identity of the responder, `R`.\n    *   The opaque ticket `T1` it received from `I`.\n    *   A new encrypted component. This component contains the tuple `{Nr, M, I, R}` encrypted with `R`'s long-term key `k(R,S)`.\n\n    The full message is: `M, I, R, T1, {Nr, M, I, R}k(R,S)`\n\n4.  **Message 3 (S -> R):** `R` receives a response from the server `S`. This message is a tuple containing:\n    *   The session identifier `M`.\n    *   A new opaque ticket (`T2`) intended for `I`.\n    *   An encrypted component for itself. `R` decrypts this using its key `k(R,S)`. The decrypted content should be the tuple `{Nr, Kir}`, where `Nr` is its original nonce and `Kir` is the new session key. `R` verifies that the nonce `Nr` matches the one it sent.\n\n    The received message is: `M, T2, {Nr, Kir}k(R,S)`\n\n5.  **Message 4 (R -> I):** `R` forwards the relevant part of the server's response to `I`. The message is a tuple containing:\n    *   The session identifier `M`.\n    *   The opaque ticket `T2` it received from `S`.\n\n    The full message is: `M, T2`\n\n#### Role: Server (S)\n\nThe trusted Server `S` is responsible for generating the session key and distributing it securely to `I` and `R`.\n\n1.  **Message 2 (R -> S):** `S` receives the combined request from `R`. It expects a message with the structure: `M, I, R, {Ni, M, I, R}k(I,S), {Nr, M, I, R}k(R,S)`.\n    *   `S` uses the key `k(I,S)` to decrypt the first encrypted component, revealing `{Ni, M, I, R}`.\n    *   `S` uses the key `k(R,S)` to decrypt the second encrypted component, revealing `{Nr, M, I, R}`.\n    *   `S` verifies that the session identifier `M` and the identities `I` and `R` are consistent across both decrypted payloads and the plaintext part of the message.\n\n2.  **Preparation:**\n    *   `S` generates a fresh session key `Kir` of type `SessionKey`.\n\n3.  **Message 3 (S -> R):** `S` constructs a response to be sent to `R`. The message is a tuple containing:\n    *   The session identifier `M`.\n    *   An encrypted ticket for `I`: the tuple `{Ni, Kir}` encrypted with `k(I,S)`.\n    *   An encrypted ticket for `R`: the tuple `{Nr, Kir}` encrypted with `k(R,S)`.\n\n    The full message is: `M, {Ni, Kir}k(I,S), {Nr, Kir}k(R,S)`\n\n---\n\n### 3. Security Claims to Verify\n\nThe model includes security claims to test the properties of the protocol.\n\n#### Claims for the Initiator (I):\n\n*   **`claim_I1(I, Secret, Kir)`**: `I` claims that the established session key `Kir` remains a secret shared only between `I` and `R`.\n*   **`claim_I2(I, Nisynch)`**: `I` claims non-injective synchronization. This asserts that if an initiator `I` completes a run of the protocol, then a responder `R` must have been running the protocol recently. It ensures liveness and matches `I`'s run with `R`'s run.\n*   **`claim_I3(I, Empty, (Fresh,Kir))`**: `I` claims that the session key `Kir` it receives is fresh (i.e., it was freshly generated for this session and has not been used in previous sessions).\n\n#### Claims for the Responder (R):\n\n*   **`claim_R1(R, Secret, Kir)`**: `R` claims that the established session key `Kir` remains a secret shared only between `R` and `I`.\n*   **`claim_R2(R, Nisynch)`**: `R` claims non-injective synchronization, mirroring the claim made by `I`.\n*   **`claim_R3(R, Empty, (Fresh,Kir))`**: `R` claims that the session key `Kir` it receives is fresh."]]}, "SPDL-1/SR3.spdl": {"code": [[true, "// Added standard usertype declarations\nusertype Nonce, Ticket;\n\n// Original declarations from the file\nhashfunction H;\nusertype Key;\n\n// Added const declaration for the long-term key function\nconst k: Function(Agent,Agent) -> Key;\n\nprotocol sr3(V,S)\n{\n\n\trole V\n\t{\n\t\tfresh Nv: Nonce;\n\t\tfresh D:Ticket;\n\t\tsend_1(V,S,{D,Nv}k(V,S),H(Nv),V);\n\t\trecv_2(S,V,Nv,V);\n\t\t\n\t\t// --- Original claims preserved as requested ---\n\t\tclaim_V1(V, Niagree);\n\t\tclaim_V2(V, Secret, D);\n\t\tclaim_V3(V, Secret, k(V,S)); // This is an assumption about the long-term key\n\t\tclaim_V4(V, Nisynch);\n\t\t// Note: This claim is expected to fail as Nv is sent in the clear in msg 2.\n\t\tclaim_V5(V, Secret, Nv);\n\t}\n\n\trole S\n\t{\n\t\tvar D:Ticket;\n\t\tvar Nv:Nonce;\n\t\t// Added variable to bind the received hash for verification\n\t\tvar Nv_hash: Hash;\n\n\t\t// The sender V is bound for use with the shared key k(V,S)\n\t\trecv_1(V,S,{D,Nv}k(V,S),Nv_hash,V);\n\t\t\n\t\t// Added check: S verifies that the hash of the decrypted nonce\n\t\t// matches the hash received in the clear.

As a Scyther expert, I can provide a detailed natural language description of the `sr3` protocol. This description is structured to be clear, precise, and sufficient for recreating the provided SPDL file.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: sr3\n\nThis document describes the `sr3` protocol, a simple two-party challenge-response protocol.\n\n#### 1. Overview\n\nThe `sr3` protocol involves two parties, an initiator `V` and a responder `S`. Its primary purpose is to allow `V` to securely transmit a secret data item `D` to `S` and for both parties to mutually authenticate each other based on a pre-shared secret key. The protocol uses a nonce `Nv` as a challenge and its hash as a commitment to prevent certain replay attacks.\n\n#### 2. Participants and Roles\n\n*   **V**: The initiator of the protocol.\n*   **S**: The responder.\n\n#### 3. Assumptions and Pre-shared Knowledge\n\n*   **Shared Key**: `V` and `S` share a long-term symmetric key, denoted as `k(V,S)`. This key is assumed to be known only to them.\n*   **Cryptographic Primitives**: A public hash function, `H`, is available to all participants.\n*   **Data Types**: The protocol uses nonces and a custom data type named `Ticket` for the secret data.\n\n#### 4. Protocol Steps\n\nThe protocol consists of two messages:\n\n**Message 1: V -> S**\n\n1.  **Generate Fresh Data**: The initiator `V` generates two fresh (new and unpredictable) values:\n    *   A nonce, `Nv`.\n    *   A secret data item, `D` (of type `Ticket`).\n\n2.  **Construct and Send Message**: `V` constructs a message with three components and sends it to `S`:\n    *   **Encrypted Part**: A tuple containing the secret data `D` and the nonce `Nv`, encrypted with the shared symmetric key `k(V,S)`. This is represented as `{D, Nv}k(V,S)`.\n    *   **Commitment**: The hash of the nonce `Nv`, represented as `H(Nv)`. This is sent in the clear.\n    *   **Identity**: The identity of the initiator, `V`, sent in the clear.\n\n    The full message is: `V -> S: {D, Nv}k(V,S), H(Nv), V`\n\n**Message 2: S -> V**\n\n1.  **Receive and Process**: The responder `S` receives the message from `V`.\n    *   It uses the shared key `k(V,S)` to decrypt the encrypted part, obtaining `D` and `Nv`.\n    *   **Verification**: `S` then computes the hash of the decrypted nonce `Nv` and verifies that it matches the `H(Nv)` value received in the clear. This confirms that the sender possesses the shared key and that the encrypted data corresponds to the commitment.\n\n2.  **Construct and Send Response**: `S` sends a response message back to `V` to confirm receipt and successful verification. The message contains two components:\n    *   The nonce `Nv` that it just received from `V`.\n    *   The identity of the initiator, `V`.\n\n    The full message is: `S -> V: Nv, V`\n\n3.  **Final Verification by V**: Upon receiving the second message, `V` checks if the received nonce is the same `Nv` it sent in the first message. If it is, `V` considers the protocol run successful.\n\n#### 5. Security Goals (Claims)\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security properties, which should be verified:\n\n1.  **Secrecy of Shared Key**: The long-term symmetric key `k(V,S)` must remain secret from any attacker.\n2.  **Secrecy of Nonce**: The nonce `Nv` generated by `V` must remain a secret shared only between `V` and `S`.\n3.  **Secrecy of Ticket**: The secret data `D` generated by `V` must remain a secret shared only between `V` and `S`.\n4.  **Agreement**: Both `V` and `S` should agree that they have participated in a run of the protocol with each other. (This corresponds to the `Niagree` claim).\n5.  **Synchronization**: The protocol should ensure that the actions of `V` and `S` are synchronized, meaning they have a consistent view of the protocol execution. (This corresponds to the `Nisynch` claim)."]]}, "SPDL-1/sts-mac.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# 1 \"sts-mac.cpp\"\n# 1 \"<command-line>\"\n# 1 \"sts-mac.cpp\"\n# 16 \"sts-mac.cpp\"\n# 1 \"common.h\" 1\n\n// --- Start of Added Notations ---\n\n// Declaring types for public key cryptography\nusertype PublicKey, SecretKey;\n\n// Declaring a public/private key pair for each agent.\n// pk is the public function to get an agent's public key.\nconst pk: Function(Agent) -> PublicKey;\n// sk is the secret function to get an agent's private key.\nsecret sk: Function(Agent) -> SecretKey;\n// Defining that pk and sk are a pair of inverse keys.\ninversekeys (pk, sk);\n\n// --- End of Added Notations ---\n\n\n hashfunction prf, KDF;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhashfunction g, h;\n# 94 \"common.h\"\nhashfunction MAC;\n\n\nprotocol @oracle (DH, SWAP) {\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n role DH {\n  var i, r: Nonce;\n\n  recv_!DH1( DH, DH, h(g(r),i) );\n  send_!DH2( DH, DH, h(g(i),r) );\n }\n\n\n\n\n role SWAP {\n  var i, r, Ni, Nr: Nonce;\n# 150 \"common.h\"\n  recv_!SWAP1( SWAP, SWAP, KDF(h(g(r),i)) );\n  send_!SWAP2( SWAP, SWAP, KDF(h(g(i),r)) );\n\n }\n\n\n}\n# 17 \"sts-mac.cpp\" 2\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprotocol @executability(O) {\n\n\n role O {\n  var i, r: Nonce;\n\n\n  recv_!O1( O, O, MAC(h(g(i),r), g(r), g(i)) );\n  send_!O2( O, O, MAC(h(g(r),i), g(r), g(i)) );\n\n\n  recv_!O3( O, O, MAC(h(g(r),i), g(i), g(r)) );\n  send_!O4( O, O, MAC(h(g(i),r), g(i), g(r)) );\n\n }\n\n\n}\n\n\n\nprotocol sts-mac(I, R)\n{\n role I {\n  fresh i: Nonce;\n  var Gr: Ticket;\n\n  send_1( I, R, g(i) );\n  // Note: Corrected signature notation from {..} to {|..|}\n  recv_!2( R, I, Gr, {|Gr, g(i)|}sk(R), MAC(h(Gr,i), Gr, g(i)) );\n  // Note: Corrected signature notation from {..} to {|..|}\n  send_!3( I, R, {|g(i), Gr|}sk(I), MAC(h(Gr,i), g(i), Gr) );\n\n  // --- Start of Added Notations ---\n  // Security Claims for Initiator I\n\n  // Claim: The private DH exponent 'i' must remain secret.\n  claim( I, Secret, i );\n  // Claim: The derived session key must be secret.\n  claim( I, Secret, KDF(h(Gr,i)) );\n\n  // Claim: I and R agree on the session key.\n  claim( I, SKR, KDF(h(Gr,i)) );\n\n  // Claim: I believes R is running the protocol.\n  claim( I, Alive );\n  // Claim: I agrees with R on protocol parameters.\n  claim( I, Weakagree );\n  // Claim: Non-injective agreement.\n  claim( I, Niagree );\n  // Claim: I is synchronized with R, providing mutual authentication.\n  claim( I, Nisynch, R );\n  // --- End of Added Notations ---\n }\n\n role R {\n  fresh r: Nonce;\n  var Gi: Ticket;\n\n  recv_1( I, R, Gi );\n  // Note: Corrected signature notation and fixed message to match receiver.\n  // Original sent 'Gi' instead of 'g(r)' as the first term.\n  send_!2( R, I, g(r), {|g(r), Gi|}sk(R), MAC(h(Gi,r), g(r), Gi) );\n  // Note: Corrected signature notation from {..} to {|..|}\n  recv_!3( I, R, {|Gi, g(r)|}sk(I), MAC(h(Gi,r), Gi, g(r)) );\n\n  // --- Start of Added Notations ---\n  // Security Claims for Responder R\n\n  // Claim: The private DH exponent 'r' must remain secret.\n  claim( R, Secret, r );\n  // Claim: The derived session key must be secret.\n  claim( R, Secret, KDF(h(Gi,r)) );\n\n  // Claim: R and I agree on the session key.\n  claim( R, SKR, KDF(h(Gi,r)) );\n\n  // Claim: R believes I is running the protocol.\n  claim( R, Alive );\n  // Claim: R agrees with I on protocol parameters.\n  claim( R, Weakagree );\n  // Claim: Non-injective agreement.\n  claim( R, Niagree );\n  // Claim: R is synchronized with I, providing mutual authentication.\n  claim( R, Nisynch, I );\n  // --- End of Added Notations ---\n }\n}", "Of course.

Here is a detailed description of the `sts-mac` protocol based on the provided SPDL file. This description is structured to be clear, unambiguous, and contains all the necessary details to reconstruct the protocol in SPDL for analysis with Scyther.\n\n---\n\n### **Protocol Description: Station-to-Station with MAC Authentication (sts-mac)**\n\nThis protocol is a variant of the signed Diffie-Hellman / Station-to-Station (STS) protocol. It aims to establish a mutually authenticated shared session key between two parties, an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R), using a combination of Diffie-Hellman key exchange for establishing a shared secret and digital signatures for authentication. Key confirmation is achieved using a Message Authentication Code (MAC).\n\n#### **Participants**\n\n*   **I**: The Initiator of the protocol.\n*   **R**: The Responder of the protocol.\n\n#### **Cryptographic Primitives and Functions**\n\n*   **Public Key Signatures**: It is assumed that both participants possess long-term public/private key pairs. The private key of a participant `A` is denoted `sk(A)`. Signatures are created over concatenated data, e.g., `{data1, data2}sk(A)`.\n*   **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange Functions**:\n    *   `g(x)`: A function that models the public part of a Diffie-Hellman exchange, where `x` is a private nonce. This represents, for example, `g^x mod p`.\n    *   `h(gx, y)`: A function that models the computation of the shared secret, e.g., `(g^x)^y mod p`. It is assumed that `h(g(x), y) = h(g(y), x)`.\n*   **Message Authentication Code (MAC)**: A symmetric-key function `MAC(key, data)` that produces an authentication tag for `data` using `key`.\n*   **Key Derivation Function (KDF)**: A function `KDF(key_material)` used to derive a final session key from the initial shared secret.\n*   **Nonces**: Fresh, unpredictable numbers generated by the participants.\n\n#### **Protocol Goal**\n\nThe primary goal is for the Initiator and Responder to mutually authenticate each other and establish a fresh, shared session key. The secrecy of this session key is a critical security property.\n\n#### **Protocol Steps**\n\nThe protocol consists of a three-message exchange:\n\n**Step 1: I -> R**\n\n1.  The **Initiator (I)** generates a fresh secret nonce, `i`.\n2.  **I** computes its ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public value: `g(i)`.\n3.  **I** sends this public value to the **Responder (R)**.\n\n*Message 1 Content:*\n`g(i)`\n\n**Step 2: R -> I**\n\n1.  The **Responder (R)** receives **I**'s public value, `g(i)`.\n2.  **R** generates its own fresh secret nonce, `r`.\n3.  **R** computes its ephemeral Diffie-Hellman public value: `g(r)`.\n4.  **R** computes the shared secret key using **I**'s public value and its own secret nonce: `k = h(g(i), r)`.\n5.  To authenticate itself, **R** creates a digital signature using its long-term private key `sk(R)` over its own public value followed by **I**'s public value: `sig_R = {g(r), g(i)}sk(R)`.\n6.  To prove it knows the shared secret `k`, **R** computes a Message Authentication Code (MAC) over the public values using `k` as the key: `mac_R = MAC(k, g(r), g(i))`.\n7.  **R** sends its public value `g(r)`, the signature `sig_R`, and the MAC `mac_R` to **I**.\n\n*Message 2 Content:*\n`g(r), {g(r), g(i)}sk(R), MAC(h(g(i), r), g(r), g(i))`\n\n**Step 3: I -> R**\n\n1.  The **Initiator (I)** receives the message from **R**.\n2.  **I** computes the same shared secret key using **R**'s public value `g(r)` and its own secret nonce `i`: `k = h(g(r), i)`.\n3.  **I** verifies **R**'s authenticity by checking the signature `{g(r), g(i)}sk(R)` with **R**'s public key.\n4.  **I** verifies that **R** knows the shared secret by re-computing the MAC `MAC(k, g(r), g(i))` and comparing it to the received `mac_R`.\n5.  If both checks pass, **I** is now assured of **R**'s identity and aliveness. To complete the mutual authentication, **I** authenticates itself to **R**.\n6.  **I** creates its own signature over its public value followed by **R**'s: `sig_I = {g(i), g(r)}sk(I)`.\n7.  **I** computes its own MAC to prove knowledge of the key `k`: `mac_I = MAC(k, g(i), g(r))`.\n8.  **I** sends the signature `sig_I` and the MAC `mac_I` to **R**.\n\n*Message 3 Content:*\n`{g(i), g(r)}sk(I), MAC(h(g(r), i), g(i), g(r))`\n\n#### **Session Key Establishment and Protocol Completion**\n\n1.  The **Responder (R)** receives the final message from **I**.\n2.  **R** verifies **I**'s signature `{g(i), g(r)}sk(I)` using **I**'s public key.\n3.  **R** verifies **I**'s MAC by re-computing `MAC(k, g(i), g(r))` and comparing it to the received `mac_I`.\n4.  If both checks pass, mutual authentication is complete.\n5.  Both parties then derive the final session key by applying the KDF to the shared secret `k`.\n    *   **Session Key** = `KDF(k)`\n\n#### **Security Claims**\n\n*   **`SKR` (Session Key Secrecy)**: The derived key, `KDF(h(g(i),r))`, is claimed to be a secret known only to the Initiator and Responder of a given session.\n*   **`Alive`**: The protocol claims to provide mutual aliveness, meaning each party is assured that the other was present and active during the protocol run.\n*   **`Weakagree`**: A standard Scyther claim indicating that participants agree on the parameters of the protocol run."]]}, "SPDL-1/tmn-2.spdl": {"code": [[true, "usertype Key;\n\nconst pk: Function;\nsecret sk: Function;\ninversekeys(pk,sk);\n\nprotocol tmn(A,B,S)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tfresh Ka: Key;\n\t\tvar Kb: Key;\n\n\t\tsend_1(A,S, B,{Ka}pk(S) );\n\t\trecv_4(S,A, B,{Kb}Ka );\n\n\t\tclaim_5(A,Secret,Ka);\n\t\tclaim_8(A,Secret,Kb);\n\t\t/* -- ANNOTATIONS START -- */\n\t\t// A can claim agreement and synchronization with B because the received key Kb \n\t\t// is fresh from B's role, guaranteeing B's recent and active participation.\n\t\tclaim(A, Nisynch);\n\t\tclaim(A, Niagree);\n\t\t/* -- ANNOTATIONS END -- */\n\t}\t\n\t\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tfresh Kb: Key;\n\n\t\trecv_2(S,B, A );\n\t\tsend_3(B,S, A, { Kb }pk(S) );\n\n\t\tclaim_6(B,Secret,Kb);\n\t\t/* -- ANNOTATIONS START -- */\n\t\t// B cannot claim any form of authentication, as it receives no\n\t\t// evidence of A's participation in this protocol run.\n\t\t/* -- ANNOTATIONS END -- */\n\t}\n\n\trole S\n\t{\n\t\tvar Ka,Kb: Key;\n\n\t\trecv_1(A,S, B,{Ka}pk(S) );\n\t\tsend_2(S,B, A );\n\t\trecv_3(B,S, A, { Kb }pk(S) );\n\t\tsend_4(S,A, B,{Kb}Ka );\n\n\t\tclaim_7(S,Secret,Ka);\n\t\t/* -- ANNOTATIONS START -- */\n\t\t// The server S interacts with both A and B and receives fresh\n\t\t// keys from both, so it can claim agreement and synchronization.\n\t\tclaim(S, Nisynch);\n\t\tclaim(S, Niagree);\n\t\t/* -- ANNOTATIONS END -- */\n\t}\n}\n\nconst Alice,Bob,Eve,Simon: Agent;", "Of course.

Based on the provided SPDL file, here is a detailed description of the `tmn` protocol. This description is structured to allow for the direct recreation of the original SPDL file.\n\n### Protocol Description: `tmn`\n\nThis document describes the `tmn` protocol, a three-party key agreement protocol mediated by a trusted server.\n\n#### 1. High-Level Goal\n\nThe protocol involves three roles: an initiator `A`, a responder `B`, and a trusted server `S`. The primary goal appears to be for `A` to receive a session key (`Kb`) that was originally generated by `B`, with `S` acting as a secure intermediary to facilitate the exchange.\n\n#### 2. Cryptographic Primitives and Setup\n\n*   **Data Types:** The protocol defines a custom data type named `Key`.\n*   **Asymmetric Cryptography:** The protocol relies on public-key cryptography.\n    *   There is a public function `pk` used for encryption, representing the public key of an agent.\n    *   There is a corresponding secret function `sk` used for decryption, representing the private key of an agent.\n    *   The functions `pk` and `sk` are defined as a pair of `inversekeys`.\n\n#### 3. Roles and Participants\n\nThe protocol is named `tmn` and involves three distinct roles:\n\n*   **Role `A` (Initiator):** The party that initiates the protocol run.\n*   **Role `B` (Responder):** The second party in the protocol run.\n*   **Role `S` (Server):** A trusted third party that mediates the key exchange.\n\nThe environment also defines four constant agents: `Alice`, `Bob`, `Eve`, and `Simon`, who can be assigned to these roles.\n\n#### 4. Protocol Steps\n\nThe protocol consists of four sequential message exchanges.\n\n**Role `A`'s Actions:**\n1.  **Preparation:** `A` generates a fresh, new session key, `Ka`. It also prepares a variable `Kb` to store the key it expects to receive.\n2.  **Message 1:** `A` sends a message to the Server `S`. This message indicates that the session is with party `B`. The payload consists of its new key `Ka`, encrypted with the Server's public key `pk(S)`.\n    *   `A -> S: B, {Ka}pk(S)`\n3.  **Message 4:** `A` receives a message from the Server `S`. It expects the payload to be encrypted with its own session key `Ka`. Upon decryption, it learns the key `Kb`.\n    *   `S -> A: B, {Kb}Ka`\n\n**Role `B`'s Actions:**\n1.  **Preparation:** `B` generates its own fresh, new session key, `Kb`.\n2.  **Message 2:** `B` receives an empty message from the Server `S`, indicating that a session with `A` is being initiated.\n    *   `S -> B: A`\n3.  **Message 3:** In response, `B` sends a message to the Server `S`, indicating the session is with `A`. The payload consists of its new key `Kb`, encrypted with the Server's public key `pk(S)`.\n    *   `B -> S: A, {Kb}pk(S)`\n\n**Role `S`'s Actions:**\n1.  **Preparation:** `S` prepares two variables, `Ka` and `Kb`, to store the keys it will receive from `A` and `B`.\n2.  **Message 1:** `S` receives the first message from `A`. It uses its private key `sk(S)` to decrypt the payload and learn `Ka`.\n    *   `A -> S: B, {Ka}pk(S)`\n3.  **Message 2:** `S` sends an empty message to `B` to prompt it to participate in the session with `A`.\n    *   `S -> B: A`\n4.  **Message 3:** `S` receives the third message from `B`.

Based on the provided SPDL file, here is a detailed description of the Woo and Lam Mutual Authentication protocol. This description is structured to be clear and comprehensive enough to allow for the reconstruction of the original SPDL file.\n\n### Protocol Description: Woo and Lam Mutual Authentication\n\nThis protocol is designed to allow two parties, an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R), to mutually authenticate each other and establish a fresh, secret session key with the help of a trusted Server (S).\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Preamble and Setup\n\n**Participants (Roles):**\n*   **I**: The Initiator of the protocol.\n*   **R**: The Responder.\n*   **S**: A trusted Server that shares long-term keys with both I and R.\n\n**Pre-shared Keys:**\n*   The Initiator `I` and the Server `S` share a long-term symmetric key, denoted as `k(I,S)`.\n*   The Responder `R` and the Server `S` share a long-term symmetric key, denoted as `k(R,S)`.\n\n**Data Types and Constants:**\n*   A custom data type `SessionKey` is defined to represent the session keys generated during the protocol.\n*   Two constants, `Fresh` and `Compromised`, are defined as functions for use in security claims.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. Protocol Execution Flow\n\nThe protocol consists of seven message exchanges:\n\n**Step 1: `I -> R: I, N1`**\n*   The Initiator `I` starts the protocol by generating a fresh, random nonce `N1`.\n*   `I` sends its identity and the nonce `N1` in plaintext to the Responder `R`.\n\n**Step 2: `R -> I: R, N2`**\n*   Upon receiving the message from `I`, the Responder `R` generates its own fresh, random nonce `N2`.\n*   `R` sends its identity and the nonce `N2` in plaintext back to the Initiator `I`.\n\n**Step 3: `I -> R: {I, R, N1, N2}k(I,S)`**\n*   After receiving `N2`, the Initiator `I` creates a message containing its own identity `I`, the Responder's identity `R`, and both nonces (`N1` and `N2`).\n*   `I` encrypts this package with its long-term symmetric key shared with the server, `k(I,S)`.\n*   `I` sends this encrypted ticket to `R`. `R` cannot decrypt this message; it is intended for the server.\n\n**Step 4: `R -> S: {I, R, N1, N2}k(I,S), {I, R, N1, N2}k(R,S)`**\n*   `R` receives the encrypted ticket from `I`.\n*   `R` creates a similar package containing the same information (`I`, `R`, `N1`, `N2`) and encrypts it with its own long-term key shared with the server, `k(R,S)`.\n*   `R` then forwards the ticket it received from `I` along with its own newly created ticket to the Server `S`.\n\n**Step 5: `S -> R: {R, N1, N2, Kir}k(I,S), {I, N1, N2, Kir}k(R,S)`**\n*   The Server `S` receives the two tickets from `R`. It uses `k(I,S)` to decrypt the first and `k(R,S)` to decrypt the second, verifying that the contents match.\n*   `S` generates a fresh session key `Kir` of type `SessionKey`.\n*   `S` creates two new tickets:\n    1.  A ticket for `I`: Containing `R`'s identity, both nonces (`N1`, `N2`), and the new session key `Kir`. This is encrypted with `k(I,S)`.\n    2.  A ticket for `R`: Containing `I`'s identity, both nonces (`N1`, `N2`), and the new session key `Kir`. This is encrypted with `k(R,S)`.\n*   `S` sends both of these encrypted tickets to `R`.\n\n**Step 6: `R -> I: {R, N1, N2, Kir}k(I,S), {N1,N2}Kir`**\n*   `R` receives the two tickets from `S`.\n*   `R` uses its key `k(R,S)` to decrypt `{I, N1, N2, Kir}k(R,S)`, thereby learning the session key `Kir` and verifying the original nonces.\n*   `R` forwards the other ticket, `{R, N1, N2, Kir}k(I,S)`, untouched to `I`.\n*   To prove its possession of the new key, `R` creates a confirmation message by encrypting both nonces `{N1,N2}` with the new session key `Kir`.\n*   `R` sends both the server's ticket for `I` and its own confirmation message to `I`.\n\n**Step 7: `I -> R: {N2}Kir`**\n*   `I` receives the two components from `R`.\n*   `I` uses its key `k(I,S)` to decrypt `{R, N1, N2, Kir}k(I,S)`, learning the session key `Kir` and verifying the nonces.\n*   `I` then uses the newly learned `Kir` to decrypt `{N1,N2}Kir` to confirm that `R` also possesses the key.\n*   As a final step to confirm its liveness to `R`, `I` encrypts the Responder's nonce, `N2`, with the session key `Kir` and sends it to `R`.\n*   `R` decrypts this final message and verifies that it contains its original nonce `N2`. At this point, mutual authentication is complete.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Security Claims to be Verified\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security properties, which are checked from the perspective of both the Initiator and the Responder.\n\n**For the Initiator (I):**\n1.  **`claim_I1(I, Secret, Kir)`**: `I` claims that the established session key `Kir` is a secret, shared only with the intended partner `R`.\n2.  **`claim_I2(I, Nisynch)`**: `I` claims that the protocol run is synchronized with a corresponding run by `R`. This ensures that `I` is not completing a protocol run with an entity that has not also completed its run. It's a non-injective synchronization claim.\n3.  **`claim_I3(I, Empty, (Fresh, Kir))`**: `I` makes a custom claim asserting that the session key `Kir` is fresh.\n\n**For the Responder (R):**\n1.  **`claim_R1(R, Secret, Kir)`**: `R` claims that the established session key `Kir` is a secret, shared only with the intended partner `I`.\n2.  **`claim_R2(R, Nisynch)`**: `R` claims that the protocol run is synchronized with a corresponding run by `I`.\n3.  **`claim_R3(R, Empty, (Fresh, Kir))`**: `R` makes a custom claim asserting that the session key `Kir` is fresh."]]}, "SPDL-1/yahalom.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# Yahalom\n#\n# Modelled after the description in the SPORE library\n# http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/yahalom.html\n#\n# Added security claims for automated analysis.\n\nusertype SessionKey;\n\nprotocol yahalom(I,R,S)\n{\n    role I\n    {\n        fresh Ni: Nonce;\n        var Nr: Nonce;\n        var T: Ticket;\n        var Kir: SessionKey;\n\n        send_1(I,R, I,Ni);\n        recv_3(S,I, {R,Kir,Ni,Nr}k(I,S), T );\n        send_4(I,R, T, {Nr}Kir );\n\n        /* SECURITY CLAIMS */\n        // Secrecy of the established session key\n        claim_I1(I, Secret, Kir);\n        // Aliveness: I believes it has engaged in a session with R, who must be running the protocol.\n        claim_I2(I, Alive);\n        // Weak Agreement: I agrees with its partner on the protocol roles.\n        claim_I3(I, Weakagree);\n        // Non-injective Agreement (Synchronization): I and R agree on the nonces.\n        claim_I4(I, Nisynch);\n        // Commit: I commits to a session with R using nonces Ni and Nr.\n        claim_I5(I, Commit, R, Ni, Nr);\n    }\n\n    role R\n    {\n        fresh Nr: Nonce;\n        var Ni: Nonce;\n        var T: Ticket;\n        var Kir: SessionKey;\n\n        recv_1(I,R, I,Ni);\n        send_2(R,S, R, {I,Ni,Nr}k(R,S) );\n        recv_4(I,R, {I,Kir}k(R,S), {Nr}Kir );\n\n        /* SECURITY CLAIMS */\n        // Secrecy of the established session key\n        claim_R1(R, Secret, Kir);\n        // Aliveness: R believes it has engaged in a session with I, who must be running the protocol.\n        claim_R2(R, Alive);\n        // Weak Agreement: R agrees with its partner on the protocol roles.\n        claim_R3(R, Weakagree);\n        // Non-injective Agreement (Synchronization): R and I agree on the nonces.\n        claim_R4(R, Nisynch);\n        // Commit: R commits to a session with I using nonces Ni and Nr.\n        claim_R5(R, Commit, I, Ni, Nr);\n\n    }\n\n    role S\n    {\n        fresh Kir: SessionKey;\n        var Ni,Nr: Nonce;\n\n        recv_2(R,S, R, {I,Ni,Nr}k(R,S) );\n        send_3(S,I, {R,Kir,Ni,Nr}k(I,S), {I,Kir}k(R,S) );\n        \n        /* SECURITY CLAIMS */\n        // The server should not leak the nonces it processes.\n        claim_S1(S, Secret, Ni);\n        claim_S2(S, Secret, Nr);\n    }\n}", "Of course.

Here is a detailed description of the Yahalom protocol based on the provided SPDL file. This description is structured to be clear and comprehensive, allowing for the regeneration of the original SPDL file.\n\n### Protocol Description: Yahalom\n\nThis document describes the Yahalom key agreement protocol.\n\n#### 1. Overview\n\nThe Yahalom protocol is a key exchange protocol that involves three parties: an **Initiator (I)**, a **Responder (R)**, and a trusted **Server (S)**. The primary goal is for the Initiator and Responder to securely establish a fresh, shared session key with the help of the trusted Server. The protocol relies on pre-shared symmetric keys between each party and the server.\n\n#### 2. Roles and Prerequisites\n\n*   **Roles:**\n    *   `I`: The Initiator of the protocol session.\n    *   `R`: The Responder.\n    *   `S`: The trusted key distribution Server.\n\n*   **Pre-shared Information:**\n    *   The Initiator `I` and Server `S` share a long-term symmetric key, denoted as `k(I,S)`.\n    *   The Responder `R` and Server `S` share a long-term symmetric key, denoted as `k(R,S)`.\n\n*   **Data Types:**\n    *   The protocol establishes a `SessionKey`, which is a distinct type of data representing the secret key to be shared between `I` and `R`.\n\n#### 3. Protocol Steps\n\nThe protocol proceeds in four messages:\n\n**Message 1: I -> R**\nThe Initiator `I` initiates the protocol run.\n*   `I` generates a fresh, random nonce, `Ni`.\n*   `I` sends its own identity and the nonce `Ni` to the Responder `R`.\n    *   **Message Format:** `I, Ni`\n\n**Message 2: R -> S**\nUpon receiving the first message, the Responder `R` contacts the Server `S`.\n*   `R` generates its own fresh, random nonce, `Nr`.\n*   `R` creates a message for the Server `S`. This message contains an encrypted component.\n*   The encrypted component contains the identity of the initiator `I`, the nonce `Ni` received from `I`, and its own nonce `Nr`. This component is encrypted using the long-term key shared between `R` and `S`, which is `k(R,S)`.\n*   `R` sends its identity and this encrypted package to `S`.\n    *   **Message Format:** `R, {I, Ni, Nr}k(R,S)`\n\n**Message 3: S -> I**\nThe Server `S` receives the message from `R`, authenticates it, and generates the session key.\n*   `S` uses the key `k(R,S)` to decrypt the package from `R` and retrieve `I`, `Ni`, and `Nr`.\n*   `S` generates a fresh `SessionKey`, `Kir`, for `I` and `R`.\n*   `S` prepares a two-part message to send back to the Initiator `I`.\n    *   **Part 1 (for I):** Contains the Responder's identity `R`, the new session key `Kir`, and both nonces (`Ni` and `Nr`). This entire payload is encrypted with the key shared between `I` and `S`, `k(I,S)`.\n    *   **Part 2 (Ticket for R):** Contains the Initiator's identity `I` and the session key `Kir`. This payload is encrypted with the key shared between `R` and `S`, `k(R,S)`. This part is opaque to `I` and is intended to be forwarded to `R`.\n    *   **Message Format:** `{R, Kir, Ni, Nr}k(I,S), {I, Kir}k(R,S)`\n\n**Message 4: I -> R**\nThe Initiator `I` receives the message from `S`, extracts the session key, and completes the protocol by contacting `R`.\n*   `I` uses its key `k(I,S)` to decrypt the first part of the message from `S`. It obtains the session key `Kir` and verifies that the returned nonce `Ni` matches the one it sent in Message 1.\n*   `I` then constructs the final message to send to `R`.\n    *   The first part of the message is the ticket (the second part of Message 3) received from `S`.\n    *   The second part of the message is the Responder's nonce `Nr` (which `I` also learned from Message 3), encrypted with the new session key `Kir`.\n    *   **Message Format:** `{I, Kir}k(R,S), {Nr}Kir`\n\n**Final Actions by R:**\n*   Upon receiving Message 4, `R` uses its key `k(R,S)` to decrypt the first part (the ticket) and retrieve the session key `Kir`.\n*   `R` then uses this new key `Kir` to decrypt the second part of the message.\n*   `R` verifies that the decrypted content matches the nonce `Nr` it generated in Step 2. If it matches, `R` is assured that the key is fresh and the message came from a party who knows `Kir`.\n\n#### 4. Security Claims\n\nAt the end of a successful run, the following security properties should hold:\n\n*   **Initiator's Claim:** `I` claims that the session key `Kir` is a secret known only to `I` and `R`.\n*   **Responder's Claim:** `R` claims that the session key `Kir` is a secret known only to `R` and `I`.\n*   **Server's Claim:** The Server `S` considers the nonces `Ni` and `Nr` it processed to be secret values, ensuring their freshness and preventing replay attacks."]]}, "SPDL-1/DHKE-1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/* \n * Adaption of two-move Diffie-Hellman ISO-9798-3 according to Shmatikov, Gupta\n *\n * Version with no signatures, but pseudo-random functions\n */\n\n// Hash functions\nhashfunction h1,h2,g1,g2;\n\n/*\n * Hack to simulate g^ab = g^ba.\n * '@' prefix of protocol name denotes helper protocol, which is used by\n * Scyther for displaying, and such protocols are ignored in\n * auto-generation of protocol modifiers.\n */\nprotocol @exponentiation(RA,RS)\n{\n\trole RA\n\t{\n\t\tvar alpha,beta, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!1(RA,RA, g2(g1(T1),T2) );\n\t\tsend_!2(RA,RA, g2(g1(T2),T1) );\n\t}\n\trole RS\n\t{\n\t\tvar alpha,beta, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!3(RS,RS, h1( g2(g1(T1),T2) ) );\n\t\tsend_!4(RS,RS, h1( g2(g1(T2),T1) ) );\n\t}\n}\n\n// The protocol description\n\nprotocol twoDHiso-prf(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tfresh x: Nonce;\n\t\tvar i: Nonce;\n\t\tvar beta: Ticket;\n\n\t\tsend_Compromise(I,I, x );\n\n\t\tsend_1(I,R,  g1(x),R,         { g1(x),R }sk(I)        );\n\t\trecv_2(R,I,  g1(x),beta,i,I,  { g1(x),beta,i,I }sk(R) );\n\t\tsend_!3(I,R,  h1( g2(beta,x ) ) );\n\n\t\t// Secrecy of the established session key\n\t\tclaim(I,SKR, g2(beta,x) );\n\t\t// I and R are running the protocol and agree on the parameters\n\t\tclaim(I,Nisynch);\n\t\t// R is alive\n\t\tclaim(I,Alive);\n\t}\t\n\t\n\trole R\n\t{\n\t\tfresh y: Nonce;\n\t\tfresh i: Nonce;\n\t\tvar alpha: Ticket;\n\n\t\tsend_Compromise(R,R, y,i );\n\n\t\trecv_1(I,R,  alpha,R,          { alpha,R }sk(I)         );\n\t\tsend_2(R,I,  alpha,g1(y),i,I,  { alpha,g1(y),i,I }sk(R) );\n\t\trecv_!3(I,R,  h1( g2(alpha,y ) ) );\n\n\t\t// Secrecy of the established session key\n\t\tclaim(R,SKR, g2(alpha,y) );\n\t\t// R and I are running the protocol and agree on the parameters\n\t\tclaim(R,Nisynch);\n\t\t// I is alive\n\t\tclaim(R,Alive);\n\t}\n}", "Of course.

Here is a detailed description of the protocol specified in the provided SPDL file. This description is structured to be clear and precise enough to allow for the reconstruction of the original SPDL code.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\nThis protocol is an adaptation of the two-move Diffie-Hellman key agreement from **ISO-9798-3**, based on a version analyzed by Shmatikov and Gupta. A key characteristic of this model is its use of pseudo-random functions (modeled as `hashfunction`s) for authentication, where other versions might use digital signatures. The protocol aims to establish a shared secret key between two parties.\n\n#### 1. Cryptographic Primitives\n\nThe protocol utilizes four one-way functions, which are modeled in Scyther as `hashfunction`:\n*   `h1`, `h2`: General-purpose hash functions.\n*   `g1`, `g2`: Functions used to model the Diffie-Hellman group operations. `g1` can be thought of as the exponentiation function (e.g., `g^x`), and `g2` as the key derivation function (e.g., `(g^y)^x`).\n\n#### 2. Helper Protocol for DH Equivalence\n\nTo allow Scyther to reason about the algebraic properties of Diffie-Hellman (i.e., `(g^a)^b = (g^b)^a`), a special helper protocol is defined.\n\n*   **Name**: `@exponentiation`\n    *   The `@` prefix is a Scyther convention to denote a helper protocol used for defining algebraic equivalences. Such protocols are typically ignored during automated analysis modifications.\n*   **Purpose**: To formally state that `g2(g1(T1), T2)` is equivalent to `g2(g1(T2), T1)`.\n*   **Roles**: `RA`, `RS`\n*   **Behavior**:\n    *   The `RA` role can transform `g2(g1(T1), T2)` into `g2(g1(T2), T1)`.\n    *   The `RS` role can perform the same transformation on terms that are wrapped in the `h1` hash function: `h1(g2(g1(T1), T2))` is equivalent to `h1(g2(g1(T2), T1))`.\n\n#### 3. Main Protocol: `twoDHiso-prf`\n\nThis is the main key agreement protocol executed between an Initiator `I` and a Responder `R`.\n\n**Roles and State:**\n\n*   **Initiator `I`**:\n    *   Generates a fresh nonce `x`.\n*   **Responder `R`**:\n    *   Generates two fresh nonces, `y` and `i`.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1.  **I -> R**: The initiator `I` sends its public Diffie-Hellman share to `R`. The message contains:\n    *   The term `g1(x)`.\n    *   The responder's identity, `R`.\n    *   An authenticator created by signing the tuple `(g1(x), R)` with the initiator's long-term private key: `{ g1(x), R }sk(I)`.\n\n2.  **R -> I**: Upon receiving the first message, the responder `R` sends its own public share to `I`. This message serves as a reply and contains:\n    *   The term `alpha` received from `I` (which is `g1(x)`).\n    *   The responder's own public share, `g1(y)`.\n    *   A fresh nonce, `i`.\n    *   The initiator's identity, `I`.\n    *   An authenticator created by signing the tuple `(alpha, g1(y), i, I)` with the responder's long-term private key: `{ alpha, g1(y), i, I }sk(R)`.\n\n3.  **I -> R**: After receiving the responder's message, the initiator `I` computes the shared secret and sends a key confirmation message. The message contains:\n    *   A hash of the computed shared secret: `h1( g2(beta, x) )`, where `beta` is the public share `g1(y)` received from `R`. The responder `R` can verify this by computing the same value using `alpha` and its secret `y`.\n\n**Security Claims:**\n\nBoth parties claim that the derived session key is a secret known only to them.\n\n*   **Initiator's Claim**: `I` claims the secrecy of the key `g2(beta, x)`.\n    *   SPDL: `claim(I, SKR, g2(beta, x))`\n*   **Responder's Claim**: `R` claims the secrecy of the key `g2(alpha, y)`.\n    *   SPDL: `claim(R, SKR, g2(alpha, y))`\n\n**Attacker Model (Compromise):**\n\nTo test for properties like forward secrecy, the protocol model explicitly defines that the ephemeral secrets (nonces) generated by the parties are considered compromised.\n\n*   The initiator `I`'s fresh nonce `x` is compromised.\n    *   SPDL: `send_Compromise(I, I, x)`\n*   The responder `R`'s fresh nonces `y` and `i` are compromised.\n    *   SPDL: `send_Compromise(R, R, y, i)`"]]}, "SPDL-1/HMQV.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/* \n * HMQV two pass version\n *\n */\n\n// Hash functions\nhashfunction h1,h2,gexp,exp,KDF,H;\n\n// Addition, multiplication\n// For now, simply hashes\nhashfunction mult,add;\n\n/*\n * Hack to simulate public knowledge of public keys.\n */\nprotocol @publickeys(PK)\n{\n\trole PK\n\t{\n\t\tsend_!1(PK,PK, gexp(sk(PK)));\n\t}\n}\n\t\t\n/*\n * Hack to simulate g^ab = g^ba inside terms.\n * '@' prefix of protocol name denotes helper protocol, which is used by\n * Scyther for displaying, and such protocols are ignored in\n * auto-generation of protocol modifiers.\n */\nprotocol @exponentiation(RA,RB,RC)\n{\n\trole RA\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!1(RA,RA, h2(\n\t\t  exp(gexp(X),Y),\n\t\t  T1, T2, RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t\tsend_!2(RA,RA, h2(\n\t\t  exp(gexp(Y),X),\n\t\t  T1, T2, RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t}\n\trole RB\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!3(RB,RB, h2(\n\t\t  T1,\n\t\t  exp(gexp(X),Y),\n\t\t  T2, RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t\tsend_!4(RB,RB, h2(\n\t\t  T1,\n\t\t  exp(gexp(Y),X),\n\t\t  T2, RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t}\n\trole RC\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!5(RC,RC, h2(\n\t\t  T1, T2,\n\t\t  exp(gexp(X),Y),\n\t\t  RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t\tsend_!6(RC,RC, h2(\n\t\t  T1, T2,\n\t\t  exp(gexp(Y),X),\n\t\t  RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t}\n}\n\nprotocol @addmult(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!1(I,I, add(X,Y) );\n\t\tsend_!2(I,I, add(Y,X) );\n\t}\n\trole R\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!3(R,R, mult(X,Y) );\n\t\tsend_!4(R,R, mult(Y,X) );\n\t}\n}\n\nprotocol @keyswap(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tvar x,y: Nonce;\n\t\trecv_!1(I,I, KDF(exp(mult(gexp(y),exp(gexp(sk(R)),H(gexp(y),I))),add(x,mult(H(gexp(x),R),sk(I))))) );\n\t\tsend_!2(I,I, KDF(exp(mult(gexp(x),exp(gexp(sk(I)),H(gexp(x),R))),add(y,mult(H(gexp(y),I),sk(R))))) );\n\t}\n}\n\n// The protocol description\n\nsymmetric-role protocol HMQV-twopass(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tfresh x: Nonce;\n\t\tvar Y: Ticket;\n\n\t\tsend_1(I,R, gexp(x) );\n\t\trecv_2(R,I, Y );\n\n\t\t// Security Claims for Initiator I\n\t\t// The ephemeral nonce 'x' must remain secret.\n\t\tclaim(I, Secret, x);\n\t\t// The derived session key must be a secret shared only between I and R.\n\t\t// The SKR claim is a strong claim that combines secrecy and agreement on the key.\n\t\tclaim(I, SKR, KDF(exp(mult(Y,exp(gexp(sk(R)),H(Y,I))),add(x,mult(H(gexp(x),R),sk(I))))) );\n\t\t// I claims that R is alive and has participated in the protocol.\n\t\tclaim(I, Alive);\n\t\t// I claims Non-injective synchronization with R.\n\t\tclaim(I, Nisynch);\n\t}\t\n\t\n\trole R\n\t{\n\t\tfresh y: Nonce;\n\t\tvar X: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_1(I,R, X );\n\t\tsend_2(R,I, gexp(y) );\n\n\t\t// Security Claims for Responder R\n\t\t// The ephemeral nonce 'y' must remain secret.\n\t\tclaim(R, Secret, y);\n\t\t// The derived session key must be a secret shared only between R and I.\n\t\tclaim(R, SKR, KDF(exp(mult(X,exp(gexp(sk(I)),H(X,R))),add(y,mult(H(gexp(y),I),sk(R))))) );\n\t\t// R claims that I is alive and has participated in the protocol.\n\t\tclaim(R, Alive);\n\t\t// R claims Non-injective synchronization with I.\n\t\tclaim(R, Nisynch);\n\t}\n}", "Of course.

Participants and Roles**\n\n*   **I**: The Initiator of the protocol.\n*   **R**: The Responder of the protocol.\n\nThe protocol is defined as having **symmetric roles**, meaning the actions performed by the Initiator and the Responder are structurally identical.\n\n---\n\n#### **2. Cryptographic Assumptions and Primitives**\n\nThe protocol's security relies on the following assumptions and cryptographic functions:\n\n*   **Public Key Infrastructure (PKI):** Each participant `P` possesses a long-term static key pair:\n    *   A static private key: `sk(P)`\n    *   A static public key: `pk(P) = g^sk(P)`, where `g` is a public generator of a cryptographic group.\n    It is assumed that the public keys of all participants are known and authentic.\n\n*   **Ephemeral Keys:** During each protocol run, participants generate temporary (ephemeral) key pairs.\n\n*   **Cryptographic Functions:**\n    *   **`g^x`**: Exponentiation with the public base `g`.\n    *   **`A^b`**: General exponentiation.\n    *   **`H`**: A public cryptographic hash function.\n    *   **`KDF`**: A Key Derivation Function used to produce the final session key.\n    *   **Addition (`+`) and Multiplication (`*`)**: Standard arithmetic operations within the exponents.\n\n*(Note for SPDL modeling: The algebraic properties, such as `(g^x)^y = (g^y)^x`, are modeled using helper protocols in Scyther to enforce the necessary equational theories.)*\n\n---\n\n#### **3. Protocol Flow**\n\nThe protocol consists of two message exchanges.\n\n**Step 1: Initiator to Responder (I -> R)**\n\n1.  The Initiator `I` generates a fresh ephemeral private key, a nonce `x`.\n2.  `I` computes its ephemeral public key `X = g^x`.\n3.  `I` sends `X` to the Responder `R`.\n\n    `I -> R: X`\n\n**Step 2: Responder to Initiator (R -> I)**\n\n1.  Upon receiving `X`, the Responder `R` generates its own fresh ephemeral private key, a nonce `y`.\n2.  `R` computes its ephemeral public key `Y = g^y`.\n3.  `R` sends `Y` to the Initiator `I`.\n\n    `R -> I: Y`\n\n---\n\n#### **4. Session Key Computation**\n\nAfter the two message exchanges, both parties are in possession of their own private keys (`sk(I)`, `x` for `I`; `sk(R)`, `y` for `R`) and all public keys (`pk(I)`, `pk(R)`, `X`, `Y`). They then compute the shared session key independently.\n\nFirst, both parties compute two intermediate hash values based on the exchanged ephemeral public keys and participant identities:\n*   `d = H(X, R)`\n*   `e = H(Y, I)`\n\n**Initiator's Key Calculation:**\n\nThe Initiator `I` computes the session key `SK` using its static private key `sk(I)`, its ephemeral private key `x`, the responder's public keys `pk(R)` and `Y`, and the hash values `d` and `e`.\n\nThe formula is:\n`SK = KDF( (Y * pk(R)^e) ^ (x + d * sk(I)) )`\n\nExpanding this with the base `g`:\n`SK = KDF( (g^y * (g^sk(R))^H(g^y, I)) ^ (x + H(g^x, R) * sk(I)) )`\n\n**Responder's Key Calculation:**\n\nThe Responder `R` computes the session key `SK` using its static private key `sk(R)`, its ephemeral private key `y`, the initiator's public keys `pk(I)` and `X`, and the hash values `d` and `e`.\n\nThe formula is:\n`SK = KDF( (X * pk(I)^d) ^ (y + e * sk(R)) )`\n\nExpanding this with the base `g`:\n`SK = KDF( (g^x * (g^sk(I))^H(g^x, R)) ^ (y + H(g^y, I) * sk(R)) )`\n\nDue to the underlying mathematical properties, both computations result in the exact same session key.\n\n---\n\n#### **5. Security Claims**\n\nThe primary security goal is to establish a secret key between `I` and `R`.\n\n*   **`SKR` (Secret Key Agreement):** Both the Initiator and Responder claim that the computed session key `SK` is secret and shared only between them. An attacker should not be able to compute this key."]]}, "SPDL-1/ikev2-mac.spdl": {"code": [[false, "<think>\n\n**Adding Annotations Now**\n\nI'm currently working on annotating the SPDL file by dissecting the `ikev2-mac` protocol. My focus is the initiator and responder roles. I need to understand their interactions to properly add Scyther annotations, particularly about how they affect security concerns.\n\n\n**Refining Annotation Strategy**\n\nI'm now refining my approach to annotations. I'll focus on the generation and exchange of keying material and the established security claims. My aim is to clearly mark nonces and long-term keys as secret, emphasizing the session key derived from them. The existing `Alive` claims seem sufficient, so I'll concentrate on ensuring the proper representation of secrets within the SPDL file.\n\n\n**Implementing Secret Annotations**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the annotation process. I've focused on marking secrets, specifically nonces generated by the Initiator and Responder. I've added `Secret` annotations to the respective roles for the freshest values of `i`, `Ni`, `SPIi`, `r`, `Nr`, and `SPIr`. The next step is to carefully represent the session key's secrecy, and I plan on adding `Secret` claims for the shared key. I'm also now focusing on the agreement claims that can be derived from the nonces in the running protocols.\n\n\n**Outlining Secret & Agreement**\n\nI've outlined my annotation strategy, preparing for detailed implementation. I'm focusing on secret annotations for nonces and session keys. I'll also introduce `Nisynch` claims to strengthen agreement proofs, solidifying the protocol's security claims. The overall structure will stay in the existing format, but with annotations.\n\n\n**Annotating for Security Claims**\n\nMy work now focuses on adding the necessary annotations to meet the defined security claims. I'm carefully scrutinizing the roles of the Initiator and Responder. I'll focus on the secrets and shared secrets. I'm adding `Secret` claims to the nonces and session keys. I am now incorporating agreement claims.\n\n\n**Refining Annotation Implementation**\n\nI'm making progress by implementing the detailed annotation plan. I've begun to add `Secret` claims, marking nonces and session keys as confidential. My next steps involve incorporating `Nisynch` claims to fortify agreement guarantees. I'm focusing on ensuring accurate and robust annotations within the IKEv2-MAC protocol.\n\n\n\n</think>\n\nOf course. Here is the annotated SPDL file for the IKEv2-mac protocol. The added claims help Scyther formally verify the secrecy of the exchanged keys and the mutual authentication between the parties.\n\nThe key annotations added are:\n* **`claim(..., Secret, ...)`**: This asserts that a particular piece of data (like a nonce or a derived key) should remain secret from the adversary.\n* **`claim(..., Nisynch)`**: This stands for \"Non-injective synchronization.\" It's a strong agreement property asserting that if a role completes a run, its partner has been running the protocol with the same parameters. This effectively verifies authentication.\n\nThese annotations are placed at points in the protocol execution where the roles can logically make make these claims.\n\n```spdl\n# 1 \"ikev2-mac.cpp\"\n# 1 \"<command-line>\"\n# 1 \"ikev2-mac.cpp\"\n# 15 \"ikev2-mac.cpp\"\n# 1 \"common.h\" 1\n\n\n\n\n hashfunction prf, KDF;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhashfunction g, h;\n# 43 \"common.h\"\nhashfunction MAC;\n# 97 \"common.h\"\nprotocol @oracle (DH, SWAP) {\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n role DH {\n  var i, r: Nonce;\n\n  recv_!DH1( DH, DH, h(g(r),i) );\n  send_!DH2( DH, DH, h(g(i),r) );\n }\n\n\n\n\n role SWAP {\n  var i, r, Ni, Nr: Nonce;\n# 132 \"common.h\"\n  var SPIi, SPIr: Nonce;\n# 150 \"common.h\"\n  recv_!SWAP1( SWAP, SWAP, KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(r),i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n  send_!SWAP2( SWAP, SWAP, KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(i),r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n }\n\n\n}\n# 16 \"ikev2-mac.cpp\" 2\n# 24 \"ikev2-mac.cpp\"\nusertype Number, SecurityAssociation, TrafficSelector;\nconst O: Number;\nconst SA1 ,SA2, SA3: SecurityAssociation;\nconst TSi, TSr: TrafficSelector;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nprotocol @executability(E) {\n\n\n role E {\n  var i, r, Ni, Nr, SPIi, SPIr: Nonce;\n  var I, R: Agent;\n\n\n  recv_!E1( E, E, {I, R, MAC(k(I,R), SPIi, O, SA1, g(i), Ni, Nr, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(r),i),SPIi,SPIr), I)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(r),i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n  send_!E2( E, E, {I, R, MAC(k(R,I), SPIi, O, SA1, g(i), Ni, Nr, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(i),r),SPIi,SPIr), I)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(i),r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n\n  recv_!E3( E, E, {R, MAC(k(R,I), SPIi, SPIr, SA1, g(r), Nr, Ni, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(i),r),SPIi,SPIr), R)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(i),r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n  send_!E4( E, E, {R, MAC(k(I,R), SPIi, SPIr, SA1, g(r), Nr, Ni, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(r),i),SPIi,SPIr), R)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(g(r),i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n }\n\n\n}\n\n\nprotocol ikev2-mac(I, R)\n{\n\n role I {\n  fresh i, Ni, SPIi: Nonce;\n  var Nr, SPIr: Nonce;\n  var Gr: Ticket;\n\n  // Secrecy of Initiator's nonce and DH exponent\n  claim(I, Secret, i);\n  claim(I, Secret, Ni);\n\n\n  send_1( I, R, SPIi, O, SA1, g(i), Ni );\n  recv_2( R, I, (SPIi,SPIr), SA1, Gr, Nr );\n\n\n  claim( I, Running, R, Ni,g(i),Nr,Gr,TSi,TSr);\n  send_!3( I, R, (SPIi,SPIr), {I, R, MAC(k(I,R), SPIi, O, SA1, g(i), Ni, Nr, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr), I)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n  recv_!4( R, I, (SPIi,SPIr), {R, MAC(k(I,R), SPIi, SPIr, SA1, Gr, Nr, Ni, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr), R)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n  // Secrecy of the derived session key\n  claim( I, Secret, KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n  claim( I, SKR, KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gr,i),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n  claim( I, Alive );\n  claim( I, Weakagree );\n  // Strong authentication and agreement on parameters\n  claim( I, Nisynch, R, Ni,g(i),Nr,Gr,TSi,TSr);\n  claim( I, Commit, R, Ni,g(i),Nr,Gr,TSi,TSr);\n\n }\n\n role R {\n  fresh r, Nr, SPIr: Nonce;\n  var Ni, SPIi: Nonce;\n  var Gi: Ticket;\n\n  // Secrecy of Responder's nonce and DH exponent\n  claim(R, Secret, r);\n  claim(R, Secret, Nr);\n\n\n  recv_1( I, R, SPIi, O, SA1, Gi, Ni );\n  send_2( R, I, (SPIi,SPIr), SA1, g(r), Nr );\n\n\n  recv_!3( I, R, (SPIi,SPIr), {I, R, MAC(k(R,I), SPIi, O, SA1, Gi, Ni, Nr, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr), I)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n  claim( R, Running, I, Ni,Gi,Nr,g(r),TSi,TSr);\n  send_!4( R, I, (SPIi,SPIr), {R, MAC(k(R,I), SPIi, SPIr, SA1, g(r), Nr, Ni, prf(KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr), R)), SA2, TSi, TSr}KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n  // Secrecy of the derived session key\n  claim( R, Secret, KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n  claim( R, SKR, KDF(Ni,Nr,h(Gi,r),SPIi,SPIr) );\n\n  claim( R, Alive );\n  claim( R, Weakagree );\n  // Strong authentication and agreement on parameters\n  claim( R, Nisynch, I, Ni,Gi,Nr,g(r),TSi,TSr);\n  claim( R, Commit, I, Ni,Gi,Nr,g(r),TSi,TSr);\n }\n}"]], "logic": [[true, "<think>**Beginning Analysis**\n\nI'm beginning to break down the provided SPDL file, focusing on the IKEv2-MAC protocol. My goal is clear: to deliver a concise \"description content.\" I am starting by carefully reading the SPDL file and outlining the key protocol elements.\n\n\n**Diving into Details**\n\nI've moved on to the core of the SPDL, dissecting the `@oracle` protocol. It seems to model Diffie-Hellman key exchange and key derivation, where the `DH` role exchanges hashed values based on nonces. These foundational elements are essential for understanding the IKEv2-MAC protocol's security mechanisms. I am starting to grasp how the pieces fit together.\n\n\n**Deepening the Investigation**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the IKEv2-MAC protocol. The helper protocols (@oracle and @executability) are giving valuable context. I've noted the unusual representation of Diffie-Hellman in the @oracle protocol and the role of the KDF function in generating keys. The structure of encrypted messages within @executability is also becoming clearer. My focus is now shifting toward the Initiator and Responder roles within the main protocol, mapping out the messages and their associated parameters.\n\n\n**Expanding the Scope**\n\nI've significantly broadened my understanding of the IKEv2-MAC protocol. The initial focus on message exchanges is now complemented by a deeper grasp of key derivation mechanisms. I've successfully traced the generation of `SKEYSEED` and the subsequent encryption of messages. Further exploration is centered around interpreting the meaning of the `TSi` and `TSr` values and dissecting the security associations and their influence on the message flow. I am also currently working on a summary of the `SPIi` and `SPIr` values.\n\n\n**Revisiting Key Derivation**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the finer points of key derivation. The SPDL's representation of Diffie-Hellman in the @oracle protocol, particularly the use of `h(g(r),i)` and `h(g(i),r)`, has been clarified. I understand how these values are incorporated in the shared secret calculation and subsequent key generation using the KDF function. My recent focus has been verifying the shared secret through these functions. The role of the `SPIi` and `SPIr` values in the KDF is also of interest.\n\n\n**Unpacking the Protocol**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on the crux of the protocol: the Key Derivation Function (KDF). Its inputs and outputs, as well as the intermediate values derived using the `h()` and `g()` functions, are of primary interest. The relationship between these values and how they impact the final secret keys is now under intense scrutiny.\n\n\n**Mapping Message Flows**\n\nI'm now outlining the Initiator and Responder message flows. Their message interactions and key derivation processes are becoming clear. The messages 1 and 2 define the initial exchange, followed by message 3 which is encrypted and authenticated. The responder follows up with message 4, which verifies the keys. The claims ensure secure exchange.\n\n\n**Mapping Message Exchanges**\n\nI'm now zeroing in on message flows: `I` initiates with `SPIi`, `SA1`, `g(i)`, `Ni`, `O`; `R` responds with `(SPIi, SPIr)`, `SA1`, `g(r)`, `Nr`.  Shared secrets and `SKEYSEED` are derived from these nonces and public keys.  Subsequent authenticated, encrypted messages further define roles. Security claims are specified.\n\n\n**Focusing on Encryption**\n\nI'm now fully immersed in the IKEv2-MAC protocol. I am making good progress defining the key generation, including the use of Diffie-Hellman, and the subsequent authenticated encryption. My attention is now focused on the encrypted messages in the IKE_AUTH exchange, ensuring I capture all relevant parameters and their roles within the protocol. I understand the structure of the messages, but I am clarifying how the parameters are combined with derived keys.\n\n\n**Analyzing Key Derivation**\n\nI'm currently focusing on the specifics of the key derivation process. The use of the KDF function, specifically its inputs and outputs, is now my primary area of investigation. Understanding the relationship between these inputs and the final secret keys is crucial to understanding the underlying security.\n\n\n**Clarifying Key Exchange**\n\nI'm making sure to clarify the Diffie-Hellman exchange and its role in generating the shared secret, crucial for understanding key derivation. I'm focusing on nonces and the shared secret calculations that are crucial for the KDF. I'm focusing on ensuring accuracy in the message exchanges.\n\n\n**Analyzing Key Exchange**\n\nI'm now clarifying the key exchange mechanism using Diffie-Hellman to generate a shared secret, essential for key derivation. Focus is on how nonces and the shared secret are used in KDF. Accuracy in message exchange descriptions is paramount.\n\n\n**Mapping Message Exchanges**\n\nI've mapped out the key exchanges, highlighting message content: I initiates with `SPIi`, `SA1`, `g(i)`, and `Ni`.  R responds with `(SPIi, SPIr)`, `SA1`, `g(r)`, and `Nr`.  Non-standard representation of Diffie-Hellman: `h(g(i), r)` for `R`, `h(g(r), i)` for `I`.  I've mapped the messages and parameter values, noting that IKE_AUTH is authenticated.  Shared secret, SKEYSEED generation.\n\n**Mapping Parameters**\n\nI've successfully mapped the IKEv2-MAC protocol's parameters, including `Ni`, `Nr`, `g(i)`, `g(r)`, `SPIi`, `SPIr`, and key derivation inputs. The crucial roles of `SKEYSEED`, shared secrets, and the message exchange flow are becoming clear. Further analysis will concentrate on understanding how those variables are used, their roles and dependencies, and how security claims are implemented.\n\n\n</think>\n\nOf course. As an expert in Scyther and the SPDL language, I can provide a detailed description of the protocol you've provided. This description breaks down the protocol's components, message flow, and security goals in a way that is clear and can be used to reconstruct the SPDL model.\n\nHere is the description of your `ikev2-mac` protocol model:\n\n---\n\n### **Protocol Description: IKEv2 with MAC Authentication**\n\nThis document describes a Scyther model of the Internet Key Exchange version 2 (IKEv2) protocol. The model focuses on the initial establishment of a security association (SA) using a Diffie-Hellman key exchange, with peer authentication provided by a Message Authentication Code (MAC) derived from a pre-shared symmetric key.\n\n#### **1. Components**\n\n**Roles:**\n*   `I`: The Initiator of the protocol session.\n*   `R`: The Responder of the protocol session.\n\n**Long-Term Credentials:**\n*   `k(A, B)`: A symmetric pre-shared key shared between agent `A` and agent `B`.\n\n**Cryptographic Primitives:**\n*   `g`: A function modeling Diffie-Hellman exponentiation. For a private nonce `x`, `g(x)` represents the corresponding public key.\n*   `h`: A function modeling the final Diffie-Hellman shared secret computation. `h(pub, priv)` computes the shared secret from a peer's public key and one's own private key.\n*   `KDF`: A Key Derivation Function. It is used to generate session keys from the Diffie-Hellman shared secret and other public data.\n*   `prf`: A Pseudo-Random Function, used as part of the authenticator construction.\n*   `MAC`: A Message Authentication Code function, used to provide data integrity and authentication.\n\n**Parameters and Constants:**\n*   `i`, `r`: Fresh, private nonces generated by the Initiator and Responder, respectively, for the Diffie-Hellman exchange.\n*   `Ni`, `Nr`: Fresh, public nonces exchanged to prevent replay attacks.\n*   `SPIi`, `SPIr`: Security Parameter Indexes. These are unique identifiers for the IKE SA being established.\n*   `SA1`, `SA2`, `SA3`: Constants representing Security Association payloads, which define the cryptographic algorithms to be used.\n*   `TSi`, `TSr`: Constants representing Traffic Selectors, which define the network traffic to be protected by the resulting IPsec SA.\n*   `O`: A constant number, likely representing the message ID in the IKE header.\n\n#### **2. Protocol Execution Flow**\n\nThe protocol consists of four messages, split into two round-trips.\n\n**Phase 1: IKE_SA_INIT (Key Exchange)**\nThis phase is unencrypted and serves to establish a shared secret via Diffie-Hellman.\n\n*   **Message 1: `I -> R`**\n    *   **Content:** `SPIi, O, SA1, g(i), Ni`\n    *   **Action:** The Initiator `I` generates its private DH value `i` and nonce `Ni`. It sends its public DH value `g(i)` and `Ni` to the Responder `R`, along with its proposed SA parameters `SA1` and its chosen `SPIi`.\n\n*   **Message 2: `R -> I`**\n    *   **Content:** `(SPIi, SPIr), SA1, g(r), Nr`\n    *   **Action:** The Responder `R` receives Message 1. It generates its own private DH value `r` and nonce `Nr`. It sends its public DH value `g(r)` and `Nr` to `I`, along with its chosen `SPIr` and the accepted SA parameters `SA1`.\n\nAt the end of this phase, both parties can compute the Diffie-Hellman shared secret. This secret is then used to derive keying material `SKEYSEED` as follows:\n`SKEYSEED = KDF(Ni, Nr, h(DH_Public_Peer, DH_Private_Self), SPIi, SPIr)`\n\n**Phase 2: IKE_AUTH (Authentication)**\nThis phase authenticates the peers and establishes the first IPsec SA. Messages in this phase are encrypted and authenticated using keys derived from `SKEYSEED`.\n\n*   **Message 3: `I -> R`**\n    *   **Content:** `(SPIi, SPIr), { Payload }_SKEYSEED`\n    *   **Action:** The Initiator authenticates itself by sending an encrypted payload.\n    *   **Payload:** `{ I, R, AUTH, SA2, TSi, TSr }`\n    *   **Authenticator (`AUTH`):** The payload contains a MAC computed over the entire session context to provide authentication:\n        `MAC(k(I,R), SPIi, O, SA1, g(i), Ni, Nr, prf(SKEYSEED, I), SA2, TSi, TSr)`\n\n*   **Message 4: `R -> I`**\n    *   **Content:** `(SPIi, SPIr), { Payload }_SKEYSEED`\n    *   **Action:** The Responder decrypts and verifies Message 3. If successful, it authenticates itself by sending its own encrypted payload.\n    *   **Payload:** `{ R, AUTH, SA2, TSi, TSr }`\n    *   **Authenticator (`AUTH`):** The Responder's MAC is computed similarly:\n        `MAC(k(I,R), SPIi, SPIr, SA1, g(r), Nr, Ni, prf(SKEYSEED, R), SA2, TSi, TSr)`\n\nUpon successful verification of Message 4 by the Initiator, the IKE SA is established, and both parties are mutually authenticated.\n\n#### **3. Security Claims for Verification**\n\nThe SPDL model specifies the following security properties to be formally verified by Scyther:\n\n*   **Secrecy (`SKR`):** Asserts that the derived session key (`SKEYSEED`) remains secret from the attacker.\n*   **Aliveness:** Asserts that if a role completes a run, it was genuinely communicating with a running peer.\n*   **Weak Agreement (`Weakagree`):** A basic form of agreement on the protocol parameters.\n*   **Agreement (`Running` & `Commit`):** Asserts that both parties finish the protocol run with a consistent view of the exchanged parameters (nonces, public keys, traffic selectors, etc.)."]]}, "SPDL-1/isoiec-9798-2-1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/*\n * Modeled from ISO/IEC 9798\n * Modeler: Cas Cremers, Dec. 2010\n *\n * symmetric\n * one-pass\n * unilateral\n *\n * Note: the identity B may be ommitted, if\n *   (a) the environment disallows such attacks, or\n *   (b) a unidirectional key is used\n */\nprotocol @keysymm-21(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tvar T: Nonce;\n\t\tvar Text: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!1(B,A, { T, A, Text }k(A,B) );\n\t\tsend_!2(A,B, { T, A, Text }k(B,A) );\n\t}\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar T: Nonce;\n\t\tvar Text: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!3(A,B, { T, B, Text }k(A,B) );\n\t\tsend_!4(B,A, { T, B, Text }k(B,A) );\n\t}\n}\n\n// Type declarations for data used in the protocol\nusertype Nonce, Ticket;\n\n// Declaration of the symmetric key k\nconst k: Function;\nsymmetric_key k;\n\n\nprotocol isoiec-9798-2-1(A,B)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\tfresh TNA: Nonce;\n\t\tfresh Text1,Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// A claims that the nonce and ticket it generates should remain secret.\n\t\tclaim(A, Secret, TNA);\n\t\tclaim(A, Secret, Text1);\n\t\tclaim(A,Running,B,TNA,Text1);\n\n\t\tsend_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\t}\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar TNA: Nonce;\n\t\tvar Text1,Text2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_1(A,B, Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B) );\n\t\t\n\t\t// After receiving a fresh message from A, B can claim that A is alive.\n\t\tclaim(B,Alive,A);\n\t\t// B agrees with A on the parameters of the run.\n\t\tclaim(B,Weakagree);\n\t\t// B commits to this run of the protocol with A.\n\t\tclaim(B,Commit,A,TNA,Text1);\n\t\t// B should also ensure the secrecy of the received data.\n\t\tclaim(B, Secret, TNA);\n\t\tclaim(B, Secret, Text1);\n\t}\n}", "Of course.

As a Scyther expert, I can provide a detailed description of the `isoiec-9798-2-1` protocol specified in the SPDL file. The first protocol definition, `@keysymm-21`, is an abstract pattern and not a complete, executable protocol. The main protocol is `isoiec-9798-2-1`.\n\nThis description is structured so that you can use it to reconstruct the provided SPDL file.\n\n***\n\n### Protocol Description: ISO/IEC 9798-2 Mechanism 1\n\nThis protocol provides **unilateral authentication** of an initiator `A` to a responder `B`. Upon completion, `B` is assured that `A` is \"alive\" and present. It is a one-pass protocol based on a challenge-response mechanism using a timestamp or nonce.\n\n#### **1. Roles and Pre-requisites**\n\n*   **Participants**: The protocol involves two roles:\n    *   `A`: The initiator, who wants to prove its identity to `B`.\n    *   `B`: The responder, who verifies the identity of `A`.\n*   **Shared Secret**: `A` and `B` must pre-share a long-term symmetric key. In the model, this is denoted as `k(A,B)`.\n\n#### **2. Protocol Variables**\n\n*   **Nonce (`TNA`)**: A fresh, randomly generated number created by `A` to ensure the message is recent and to prevent replay attacks.\n*   **Payloads (`Text1`, `Text2`)**: These represent optional application-specific data. Scyther models them as `Ticket` types.\n    *   `Text1` is included inside the encrypted part of the message.\n    *   `Text2` is sent in the clear (unencrypted).\n\n#### **3. Protocol Steps**\n\nThe protocol consists of a single message sent from `A` to `B`.\n\n**Step 1: A -> B**\n\n`A` initiates the protocol run and sends one message to `B`.\n\n**Message Format:**\n\n`A -> B: Text2, { TNA, B, Text1 }k(A,B)`\n\n**Message Construction (Role A):**\n\n1.  **Generate Fresh Data**: `A` generates a fresh nonce `TNA`, and two fresh payloads, `Text1` and `Text2`.\n2.  **Create Encrypted Token**: `A` creates a data block containing:\n    *   The fresh nonce `TNA`.\n    *   The explicit identity of the intended responder, `B`.\n    *   The payload `Text1`.\n3.  **Encrypt Token**: `A` encrypts this data block using the shared symmetric key `k(A,B)`.\n4.  **Send Message**: `A` sends a message to `B` that consists of two parts: the cleartext payload `Text2` and the encrypted token from the previous step.\n\n**Message Verification (Role B):**\n\n1.  **Receive Message**: `B` receives the message from `A`, containing the cleartext `Text2` and the encrypted token.\n2.  **Decrypt Token**: `B` uses its shared symmetric key `k(A,B)` to decrypt the encrypted token.\n3.  **Verify Identity**: `B` checks that the identity inside the decrypted token matches its own identity (`B`). This is a critical step to prevent reflection attacks.\n4.  **Extract Data**: If the decryption and identity check are successful, `B` extracts the nonce `TNA` and the payload `Text1`. `B` now considers `A` to be authenticated.\n\n#### **4. Security Claims (for Scyther Verification)**\n\nTo enable formal verification with Scyther, the protocol model includes the following security claims:\n\n*   **In Role A:**\n    *   `claim(A, Running, B, TNA, Text1)`: `A` claims that it is starting a protocol run with `B`, and that the parameters `TNA` and `Text1` are bound to this specific session.\n\n*   **In Role B:**\n    *   `claim(B, Commit, A, TNA, Text1)`: After successfully verifying the message, `B` claims that it has committed to a protocol run with `A` using the parameters `TNA` and `Text1`. This asserts that `B` believes the message from `A` is authentic.\n    *   `claim(B, Alive)`: `B` claims that `A` is alive. This is inferred from `A`'s ability to correctly encrypt the fresh nonce `TNA`.\n    *   `claim(B, Weakagree)`: `B` claims that it is in agreement with `A` on the protocol parameters. This is a non-injective agreement claim."]]}, "SPDL-1/KAS1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/* \n * KEA+\n *\n * From \"Security Analysis of KEA Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol\"\n * Lauter, Mityagin, 2006.\n * \n * We find no attacks in CK if only the ephemeral key is revealed.\n * We do find attacks for both roles in CK if the input to hash1 is\n * revealed.\n */\n\n// Hash functions\nhashfunction h1,h2,g1,g2;\n\n/*\n * Hack to gain equivalence of public keys to g^private.\n */\nprotocol @publickeys(RA,RB,RC)\n{\n\trole RA\n\t{\n\t\tsend_!1(RA,RA, g1(sk(RA)) );\n\t}\n\trole RB\n\t{\n\t\t// Special one to go into DH g2\n\t\tvar T: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!2(RB,RB, g2(g1(T),sk(RB)) );\n\t\tsend_!3(RB,RB, g2(pk(RB),T) );\n\t}\n\trole RC\n\t{\n\t\t// Special one to go into DH g2\n\t\tvar T: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!4(RC,RC, g2(pk(RC),T) );\n\t\tsend_!5(RC,RC, g2(g1(T),sk(RC)) );\n\t}\n}\n\n/*\n * Hack to simulate g^ab = g^ba.\n * '@' prefix of protocol name denotes helper protocol, which is used by\n * Scyther for displaying, and such protocols are ignored in\n * auto-generation of protocol modifiers.\n */\nprotocol @exponentiation(RA,RB,RC)\n{\n\trole RA\n\t{\n\t\tvar alpha,beta, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!1(RA,RA, g2(g1(T1),T2) );\n\t\tsend_!2(RA,RA, g2(g1(T2),T1) );\n\t}\n\trole RB\n\t{\n\t\tvar T1,T2,T3: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!3(RB,RB, h1(g2(g1(T1),T2),T3,RC,RB) );\n\t\tsend_!4(RB,RB, h1(g2(g1(T2),T1),T3,RC,RB) );\n\t}\n\trole RC\n\t{\n\t\tvar T1,T2,T3: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!5(RC,RC, h1(T3,g2(g1(T1),T2),RC,RA) );\n\t\tsend_!6(RC,RC, h1(T3,g2(g1(T2),T1),RC,RA) );\n\t}\n}\n\n// The protocol description\n\nprotocol KEAplus(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tfresh x: Nonce;\n\t\tvar beta: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// The ephemeral private key 'x' is compromised to test forward secrecy.\n\t\tsend_Compromise(I,I, x);\n\n\t\tsend_1(I,R, g1(x) );\n\t\trecv_2(R,I, beta );\n\n\t\t/* -- Security Claims for the Initiator -- */\n\t\t// Liveness: I is assured that R is running the protocol.\n\t\tclaim(I, Alive);\n\t\t// Non-injective Agreement: I is assured that R is running the protocol with I.\n\t\tclaim(I, Niagree);\n\t\t// Non-injective Synchronization: A stronger property ensuring run correspondence.\n\t\tclaim(I, Nisynch);\n\t\t// Secrecy of ephemeral key.

Participants**\n\nThe protocol involves two participants:\n\n*   **I**: The Initiator of the protocol.\n*   **R**: The Responder of the protocol.\n\n**2. Cryptographic Assumptions**\n\n*   **Asymmetric Cryptography**: Each participant `A` (where `A` is `I` or `R`) possesses a long-term public/private key pair.\n    *   The private key is denoted as `sk(A)`.\n    *   The public key is denoted as `pk(A)`.\n*   **Diffie-Hellman Group**: The protocol relies on a group suitable for Diffie-Hellman key exchange. We will use `g` as the generator of this group.\n    *   Exponentiation `g^a` is represented in the model by a function `g1(a)`.\n    *   The Diffie-Hellman shared secret calculation `(g^a)^b` is represented by a function `g2(g1(a), b)`. The model assumes the standard DH property that `g2(g1(a), b)` is equivalent to `g2(g1(b), a)`. It's also assumed that `pk(A)` is equivalent to `g1(sk(A))`.\n*   **Hash Function**: A cryptographic hash function, `h1`, is used for key derivation.\n\n**3. Protocol Steps**\n\nThe protocol consists of two messages exchanged between the Initiator and the Responder.\n\n**Step 1: I -> R**\n\n1.  The Initiator `I` generates a fresh, random nonce `x`, which serves as its ephemeral private key.\n2.  `I` computes its ephemeral public key `alpha = g^x`.\n3.  `I` sends `alpha` to the Responder `R`.\n\n    > Message 1: `I -> R: g^x`\n\n**Step 2: R -> I**\n\n1.  The Responder `R` receives `alpha` from `I`.\n2.  `R` generates its own fresh, random nonce `y`, which serves as its ephemeral private key.\n3.  `R` computes its ephemeral public key `beta = g^y`.\n4.  `R` sends `beta` to the Initiator `I`.\n\n    > Message 2: `R -> I: g^y`\n\n**4. Session Key Calculation**\n\nAfter the message exchange, both parties compute a shared session key. The key is derived by hashing two Diffie-Hellman shared secrets along with the identities of the participants.\n\n*   **Responder's Calculation:**\n    `R` computes two intermediate secrets:\n    1.  The result of a DH exchange between `I`'s long-term public key and `R`'s ephemeral private key: `(pk(I))^y`.\n    2.  The result of a DH exchange between `I`'s ephemeral public key (`alpha`) and `R`'s long-term private key: `(alpha)^(sk(R))`.\n    `R` then computes the final session key `K` as:\n    `K = h1( (pk(I))^y, alpha^(sk(R)), I, R )`\n\n*   **Initiator's Calculation:**\n    `I` computes two intermediate secrets:\n    1.  The result of a DH exchange between `R`'s ephemeral public key (`beta`) and `I`'s long-term private key: `(beta)^(sk(I))`.\n    2.  The result of a DH exchange between `R`'s long-term public key and `I`'s ephemeral private key: `(pk(R))^x`.\n    `I` then computes the final session key `K` as:\n    `K = h1( beta^(sk(I)), (pk(R))^x, I, R )`\n\n**5. Security Goal**\n\nThe primary security goal is that both `I` and `R` establish a shared secret key `K` that is unknown to any external attacker. This property should hold even if the attacker can compromise the ephemeral keys `x` and `y` after the session is complete."]]}, "SPDL-1/NAXOS.spdl": {"code": [[false, "<think>\n\n**Analyzing SPDL File**\n\nI'm currently working on annotating an SPDL file for the NAXOS protocol, focusing on Scyther compatibility while preserving the original code. This involves understanding the file's structure and mapping it to annotations, ensuring semantic accuracy throughout the process. I'm exploring different annotation strategies to identify the most effective approach.\n\n\n**Decoding Protocol Steps**\n\nMy understanding of the NAXOS protocol is deepening. I've broken down the protocol flow, identifying Initiator and Responder roles and core cryptographic operations. I'm focusing on key derivation, particularly how the session key is computed, ensuring Scyther compatibility is integrated seamlessly.\n\n\n**Refining Key Derivation**\n\nI've been working on the key derivation part, carefully analyzing how the session key is computed by both Initiator and Responder. I'm focused on mapping the SPDL code to equivalent Scyther annotations, paying close attention to the roles of the hash functions and modular exponentiation within each step. The goal is to ensure the annotations are semantically faithful and will allow the NAXOS protocol to run correctly within the Scyther environment.\n\n\n**Formulating Scyther Claims**\n\nI'm now focusing on translating the NAXOS protocol logic into Scyther claims. I've identified the core security properties to check, primarily secrecy and authentication. I plan to use `Secret` claims to ensure the session key's confidentiality for both Initiator and Responder roles. For authentication, I intend to use `Nisynch` claims to verify mutual agreement on participants. I'm carefully formulating the specific terms for each claim to accurately reflect the protocol's structure.\n\n\n**Refining Claim Generation**\n\nI'm now focusing on implementing the claims in the SPDL file. The claims will focus on verifying the secrecy of the derived session key for both the Initiator and Responder. I'll add `Nisynch` claims to ensure mutual authentication.  My goal is to create a set of annotations that are both comprehensive and concise.\n\n\n**Formulating Claims & Implementation**\n\nI've formulated the claims for Secrecy, Nisynch, Niagree, and Alive, both for the Initiator and Responder. I've now integrated these claims into the SPDL code, placing them strategically within each role after the existing `SKR` claims. I've also added comments for clarity. I've reviewed the changes and confirmed that the original code remains intact, and the added annotations are semantically valid and ready for Scyther analysis. The file should now be fully runnable in Scyther.\n\n\n**Adding Security Claims**\n\nI've integrated the claims for secrecy, mutual authentication (`Nisynch`), and aliveness (`Alive`, `Niagree`) into the NAXOS SPDL code. These are now placed strategically within both Initiator and Responder roles, just after the existing `SKR` claims, which are retained. Comments clarify the purpose of each annotation, ensuring the code is both functional and understandable for Scyther analysis.

My focus is on synthesizing a natural language description. I'm aiming for clarity and completeness, so that an expert could recreate the SPDL file based on my output. Right now I am breaking down the header, exploring the core components, and examining how the elements are interrelated.\n\n\n**Dissecting Protocol Elements**\n\nI've been analyzing the header comments, identifying key context like the research source and potential attack vectors. The global declarations are now clear: two hash functions, an exponentiation model, and a generator. I'm currently focused on the helper protocols, trying to understand how they model public key distribution, exponentiation, and key symmetry within the NAXOS AKE framework. Understanding these subprotocols is crucial for a complete protocol description.\n\n\n**Unpacking Helper Functions**\n\nI'm now clarifying the roles of the helper protocols. `@exponentiation` and `@keysymmetry` are indeed designed to handle the commutative property of exponentiation within the Scyther context, particularly how they deal with exponentiation within the `h2` hash function. I'm noting the significance of this for modeling the key exchange, especially the different cases that `@keysymmetry` covers. Understanding how Scyther approximates these properties is key to a faithful representation.\n\n\n**Defining Key Exchange Details**\n\nI'm now detailing the core key exchange within the NAXOS protocol, building on my understanding of the helper functions. The initiator generates an ephemeral secret, combines it with their long-term secret in a hash, and exponentiates the generator by this hash. The responder's return message, computed similarly with the responder's secrets, is crucial for both to derive a shared secret. I'm focusing on clarifying how both roles contribute to this shared secret calculation using the exchanged public keys and the original secrets.\n\n\n**Synthesizing Protocol Logic**\n\nI've been working on structuring the roles within the NAXOS AKE protocol. Both initiator and responder generate ephemeral secrets, which are combined with their long-term keys in a hash function. I'm noting the significance of the `h1` and `h2` functions in key derivation. My focus is on clarifying how the shared secret is computed using these hash functions and how the public keys of the parties are integral for key symmetry.\n\n\n**Modeling the Core Exchange**\n\nHaving grasped the roles of the helper protocols and their significance within Scyther's framework, I'm now fully focused on the NAXOS key exchange itself. I'm clarifying the steps: an initiator generates a secret, combines it with their long-term key, and exponentiates the generator by the result. The responder computes a similar value, and the exchanged messages allow both to derive a shared secret using those values. I'm working to articulate this exchange step-by-step.\n\n\n**Revising Key Derivation**\n\nI'm now refining the key derivation stage. Both parties calculate `K1`, `K2`, and `K3` and combine them with `h2` to generate the shared secret. I'm noting the symmetry: `K1` at the responder is constructed similarly, but from the perspective of the initiator, using the responder's public key. I'll need to detail how the equivalence of the computed keys from the initiator and responder roles, are derived by the helper protocols.\n\n\n**Formulating the Core Exchange**\n\nI've been working on structuring the protocol description to emphasize the key exchange. My aim is a clear, step-by-step account, emphasizing the roles of both initiator and responder in deriving the shared secret. I'm focusing on the symmetry of key computations, highlighting how their exchanges lead to identical secret keys using public keys. I'm now aiming to make each step unambiguous.\n\n\n**Defining the Shared Secret**\n\nI'm now detailing how both parties contribute to the shared secret. After receiving `Y`, the initiator calculates `K1 = Y^sk(I)`,  `K2 = (R's PK)^h1(eskI, sk(I))`, and `K3 = Y^h1(eskI, sk(I))`. The responder constructs similar values from its perspective, using the initiator's public key to achieve symmetry, both parties then derive the shared secret.\n\n\n</think>\n\nOf course. I can help you with that. Here is a detailed description of the NAXOS (Authenticated Key Exchange) protocol based on the provided SPDL file. This description is structured to be clear enough to allow for the reconstruction of the original Scyther model.\n\n### Protocol Description: NAXOS AKE\n\n#### 1. Overview\n\nThe NAXOS protocol is an Authenticated Key Exchange (AKE) protocol designed to establish a shared secret key between two parties, an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R), over an insecure channel. The security of the protocol relies on the Diffie-Hellman problem and the use of cryptographic hash functions.\n\n#### 2. Cryptographic Primitives & Assumptions\n\n*   **Parties**: An Initiator `I` and a Responder `R`.\n*   **Long-term Keys**: Each party `A` (where `A` is `I` or `R`) possesses a long-term static secret key, denoted as `sk(A)`. The corresponding public key is `pk(A) = g^sk(A)`, where `g` is a publicly known generator of a cyclic group. All public keys are assumed to be known by all parties before the protocol run.\n*   **Ephemeral Keys**: During each run, each party generates a fresh, single-use (ephemeral) secret nonce.\n*   **Hash Functions**: Two public cryptographic hash functions, `h1` and `h2`, are used.\n*   **Scyther Modeling Note**: In the SPDL model, exponentiation like \\(g^x\\) is modeled using a one-way function `p(g,x)`. Since Scyther does not natively handle the algebraic property \\((g^a)^b = (g^b)^a\\), the model includes helper protocols (`@exponentiation`, `@keysymmetry`) to teach Scyther this equivalence. The `@publickeys` protocol models the public availability of long-term public keys.\n\n#### 3. Protocol Steps\n\nThe protocol consists of a two-message exchange followed by a key derivation step on both sides.\n\n**Step 1: Initiator \u2192 Responder**\n\nThe Initiator `I` performs the following actions:\n1.  Generates a fresh ephemeral secret nonce, `eskI`.\n2.  Computes an ephemeral public value `X` as:\n    \\[ X = g^{h_1(esk_I, sk(I))} \\]\n3.  Sends `X` to the Responder `R`.\n\n**Message 1:** `I \u2192 R: X`\n\n**Step 2: Responder \u2192 Initiator**\n\nThe Responder `R` receives `X` and performs the following actions:\n1.  Generates its own fresh ephemeral secret nonce, `eskR`.\n2.  Computes its ephemeral public value `Y` as:\n    \\[ Y = g^{h_1(esk_R, sk(R))} \\]\n3.  Sends `Y` to the Initiator `I`.\n\n**Message 2:** `R \u2192 I: Y`\n\n#### 4. Session Key Derivation\n\nAfter the message exchange, both parties compute a shared session key. They use their own secrets, the value they received, and the long-term public key of their peer.\n\n**Initiator `I`'s Key Calculation:**\nUpon receiving `Y`, `I` computes three intermediate values using its secret keys (`sk(I)`, `eskI`), the received value `Y`, and `R`'s public key `pk(R) = g^sk(R)`:\n\n*   \\(K_1 = Y^{sk(I)} = (g^{h_1(esk_R, sk(R))})^{sk(I)}\\)\n*   \\(K_2 = (pk(R))^{h_1(esk_I, sk(I))} = (g^{sk(R)})^{h_1(esk_I, sk(I))}\\)\n*   \\(K_3 = Y^{h_1(esk_I, sk(I))} = (g^{h_1(esk_R, sk(R))})^{h_1(esk_I, sk(I))}\\)\n\nThe final session key `SK` is the hash of these values combined with the party identities:\n\\[ SK = h_2(K_1, K_2, K_3, I, R) \\]\n\n**Responder `R`'s Key Calculation:**\n`R` computes three corresponding intermediate values using its secret keys (`sk(R)`, `eskR`), the received value `X`, and `I`'s public key `pk(I) = g^sk(I)`:\n\n*   \\(K_1' = (pk(I))^{h_1(esk_R, sk(R))} = (g^{sk(I)})^{h_1(esk_R, sk(R))}\\)\n*   \\(K_2' = X^{sk(R)} = (g^{h_1(esk_I, sk(I))})^{sk(R)}\\)\n*   \\(K_3' = X^{h_1(esk_R, sk(R))} = (g^{h_1(esk_I, sk(I))})^{h_1(esk_R, sk(R))}\\)\n\nDue to the properties of exponentiation, \\(K_1 = K_1'\\), \\(K_2 = K_2'\\), and \\(K_3 = K_3'\\). Thus, `R` computes the identical session key:\n\\[ SK = h_2(K_1', K_2', K_3', I, R) \\]\n\nAt the conclusion of the protocol, `I` and `R` share the secret key `SK`."]]}, "SPDL-1/nsl3.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/*\n * Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol\n * This is the annotated version for Scyther analysis.\n */\n\n// Define basic types used in the protocol.\nusertype Agent;\nusertype Nonce;\n\n// Define the public key infrastructure.\n// The function 'pk' maps an agent to its public key.\n// Scyther automatically infers the corresponding private key 'sk'.\nconst pk: Agent -> PublicKey;\n\n// Define identifiers for security properties to be checked.\nconst Secret, Niagree, Nisynch: ProtocolID;\n\n\n// The protocol description\nprotocol nsl3(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tfresh ni: Nonce;\n\t\tvar nr: Nonce;\n\n\t\tsend_1(I,R, {I,ni}pk(R) );\n\t\trecv_2(R,I, {ni,nr,R}pk(I) );\n\t\t// After receiving message 2, I is assured that R has been\n\t\t// running the protocol and has created the nonce nr.\n\t\t// This is a key synchronization point for agreement claims.\n\t\tclaim(I, Running, R, ni, nr);\n\n\t\tsend_3(I,R, {nr}pk(R) );\n\t\t// After sending message 3, I has completed its part of the\n\t\t// protocol.

Participants (Roles)\n\nThe protocol involves two main roles:\n\n*   **Initiator (I):** The agent who starts the protocol run.\n*   **Responder (R):** The agent who responds to the initiator's request.\n\nIt is assumed that each participant has a public/private key pair. The public key of any agent `X` is denoted as `pk(X)`.\n\n#### 2. Protocol Roles and Steps\n\nThe protocol consists of three message exchanges.\n\n---\n\n##### **Role: Initiator (I)**\n\n**Variable Declaration:**\n\n*   The Initiator `I` generates a **fresh** nonce `ni`. A fresh value is unique and unpredictable for each protocol run.\n*   It declares a variable `nr` of type `Nonce`, which it expects to receive and learn from the Responder during the protocol run.\n\n**Message Exchange:**\n\n1.  **Message 1 (Send): `I -> R`**\n    *   The Initiator `I` sends a message to the Responder `R`.\n    *   The content of the message is a tuple containing the Initiator's identity `I` and its fresh nonce `ni`.\n    *   This tuple `{I, ni}` is encrypted with the public key of the Responder, `pk(R)`.\n    *   **Format:** `{I, ni}pk(R)`\n\n2.  **Message 2 (Receive): `R -> I`**\n    *   The Initiator `I` expects to receive a message from the Responder `R`.\n    *   The content of the message should be a tuple containing its original nonce `ni`, a new nonce from the responder `nr`, and the Responder's identity `R`.\n    *   This tuple `{ni, nr, R}` is encrypted with the public key of the Initiator, `pk(I)`.\n    *   **Format:** `{ni, nr, R}pk(I)`\n\n3.  **Message 3 (Send): `I -> R`**\n    *   The Initiator `I` sends a final confirmation message to the Responder `R`.\n    *   The content of the message is the Responder's nonce `nr` that `I` learned in the previous step.\n    *   This nonce `{nr}` is encrypted with the public key of the Responder, `pk(R)`.\n    *   **Format:** `{nr}pk(R)`\n\n---\n\n##### **Role: Responder (R)**\n\n**Variable Declaration:**\n\n*   The Responder `R` declares a variable `ni` of type `Nonce`, which it expects to receive and learn from the Initiator.\n*   It generates a **fresh** nonce `nr`.\n\n**Message Exchange:**\n\n1.  **Message 1 (Receive): `I -> R`**\n    *   The Responder `R` expects to receive a message from the Initiator `I`.\n    *   The message content, once decrypted with `R`'s private key, should contain the Initiator's identity `I` and a nonce `ni`.\n    *   **Format:** `{I, ni}pk(R)`\n\n2.  **Message 2 (Send): `R -> I`**\n    *   The Responder `R` sends a message back to the Initiator `I`.\n    *   The content of the message is a tuple containing the received nonce `ni`, its own fresh nonce `nr`, and its identity `R`.\n    *   This tuple `{ni, nr, R}` is encrypted with the public key of the Initiator, `pk(I)`.\n    *   **Format:** `{ni, nr, R}pk(I)`\n\n3.  **Message 3 (Receive): `I -> R`**\n    *   The Responder `R` expects to receive the final message from the Initiator `I`.\n    *   The message content, once decrypted, should be its own nonce `nr` that it sent in the previous step.\n    *   **Format:** `{nr}pk(R)`\n\n---\n\n#### 3. Security Claims (Verification Goals)\n\nThe following security properties are to be verified for the protocol.\n\n##### **Claims for the Initiator (I):**\n\n*   `claim_i1`: The Initiator `I` claims that its generated nonce `ni` remains a **Secret** between `I` and `R`.\n*   `claim_i2`: The Initiator `I` claims that the received nonce `nr` remains a **Secret** between `I` and `R`.\n*   `claim_i3`: The Initiator `I` makes a **Niagree** (Non-injective agreement) claim. This asserts that if `I` completes a run of the protocol, apparently with `R`, then `R` has also been running the protocol, apparently with `I`.\n*   `claim_i4`: The Initiator `I` makes a **Nisynch** (Non-injective synchronization) claim. This is a stronger property than `Niagree`, ensuring a one-to-one correspondence between completed runs of the Initiator and Responder.\n\n##### **Claims for the Responder (R):**\n\n*   `claim_r1`: The Responder `R` claims that the received nonce `ni` remains a **Secret** between `R` and `I`.\n*   `claim_r2`: The Responder `R` claims that its generated nonce `nr` remains a **Secret** between `R` and `I`.\n*   `claim_r3`: The Responder `R` makes a **Niagree** claim.\n*   `claim_r4`: The Responder `R` makes a **Nisynch** claim."]]}, "SPDL-1/Signed-DH.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/* \n * Two-move Diffie-Hellman in the UM\n * From CK2001, p. 20\n */\n\n// Added type and key declarations for analysis\nusertype Agent, Nonce, Ticket, pkey, skey;\n\n// Public/secret key infrastructure definition\nconst pk: Agent -> pkey;\nconst sk: Agent -> skey;\ninversekeys (pk(A), sk(A)) for A: Agent;\n\n\n// Hash functions\nhashfunction h1,h2,g1,g2;\n\n/*\n * Hack to simulate g^ab = g^ba.\n * '@' prefix of protocol name denotes helper protocol, which is used by\n * Scyther for displaying, and such protocols are ignored in\n * auto-generation of protocol modifiers.\n */\nprotocol @exponentiation(RA)\n{\n\trole RA\n\t{\n\t\tvar alpha,beta, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!1(RA,RA, g2(g1(T1),T2) );\n\t\tsend_!2(RA,RA, g2(g1(T2),T1) );\n\t}\n}\n\n// The protocol description\n\nprotocol SIG-DH-UM(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tfresh s: Nonce;\n\t\tfresh x: Nonce;\n\t\tvar beta: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// Security claims for the Initiator\n\t\tclaim(I, Secret, x);      // The DH private exponent 'x' must remain secret.\n\t\tclaim(I, SessionID, s);   // The nonce 's' should uniquely identify the session.\n\n\t\tsend_1(I,R, I,s,g1(x) );\n\t\trecv_2(R,I, R,s,beta, { R,s,beta,g1(x),I }sk(R) );\n\t\t\n\t\t// Claims after verifying R's signature\n\t\tclaim(I, Alive);          // R must be alive to create the signature on the fresh data.\n\t\tclaim(I, Niagree);        // I agrees with R on the exchanged parameters.\n\n\t\tsend_3(I,R, I,s, { I,s,g1(x),beta,R }sk(I) );\n\n\t\t// The derived session key must be secret.\n\t\tclaim(I, Secret, g2(beta,x) );\n\t}\t\n\t\n\trole R\n\t{\n\t\tfresh y: Nonce;\n\t\tvar s: Nonce;\n\t\tvar alpha: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_1(I,R, I,s,alpha );\n\t\t\n\t\t// Security claims for the Responder\n\t\tclaim(R, Secret, y);      // The DH private exponent 'y' must remain secret.\n\t\tclaim(R, SessionID, s);   // The nonce 's' should uniquely identify the session.\n\n\t\tsend_2(R,I, R,s,g1(y), { R,s,g1(y),alpha,I }sk(R) );\n\t\trecv_3(I,R, I,s, { I,s,alpha,g1(y),R }sk(I) );\n\n\t\t// Claims after verifying I's signature\n\t\tclaim(R, Alive);          // I must be alive to create the signature.\n\t\tclaim(R, Niagree);        // R agrees with I on the exchanged parameters.\n\t\t\n\t\t// The derived session key must be secret.\n\t\tclaim(R, Secret, g2(alpha,y) );\n\t}\n}", "Of course, I can help you with that.

As a Scyther expert, I can provide a detailed description of the `SIG-DH-UM` protocol from which the provided SPDL file can be reconstructed.\n\nHere is the description of the protocol:\n\n***\n\n### Protocol: Signed Diffie-Hellman (SIG-DH-UM)\n\nThis protocol describes a three-move, signed Diffie-Hellman key exchange between an Initiator **I** and a Responder **R**. It aims to establish a shared secret key, providing mutual authentication through the use of digital signatures.\n\n#### 1. Global Declarations & Setup\n\nBefore defining the protocol, the following elements must be declared:\n\n**Cryptographic Functions:**\nFour functions are declared, all modeled as `hashfunction` in SPDL.\n*   `h1`, `h2`: General-purpose hash functions (Note: These are declared but not used in the main protocol).\n*   `g1`: Represents the Diffie-Hellman exponentiation operation, e.g., `g^x`.\n*   `g2`: Represents the final shared key calculation, e.g., `(g^y)^x`.\n\n**Diffie-Hellman Equivalence Modeling (Helper Protocol):**\nTo model the algebraic property of Diffie-Hellman (`(g^a)^b = (g^b)^a`), a special helper protocol is used. In Scyther, helper protocols are prefixed with `@` to be ignored during certain analyses.\n\n*   **Protocol Name:** `@exponentiation`\n*   **Role:** A single role, `RA`.\n*   **Purpose:** To establish the equality `g2(g1(a), b) = g2(g1(b), a)`.\n*   **Behavior:** The role `RA` receives `g2(g1(T1), T2)` and sends `g2(g1(T2), T1)`. This teaches Scyther's solver that these two terms are equivalent.\n\n#### 2. Protocol Roles and Agents\n\nThe main protocol is named `SIG-DH-UM` and involves two roles:\n*   **I**: The Initiator.\n*   **R**: The Responder.\n\n#### 3. Protocol Execution Flow\n\nThe protocol consists of three messages.\n\n**Initial State:**\n*   The **Initiator (I)** generates two fresh nonces:\n    *   `s`: A session nonce.\n    *   `x`: Its private Diffie-Hellman exponent.\n*   The **Responder (R)** generates one fresh nonce:\n    *   `y`: Its private Diffie-Hellman exponent.\n\n**Message 1: I -> R**\nThe Initiator starts the protocol by sending its identity, the session nonce, and its public Diffie-Hellman value.\n*   **Content:** `I, s, g1(x)`\n\n**Message 2: R -> I**\nUpon receiving the first message, the Responder authenticates itself by sending its public Diffie-Hellman value and a signature.\n*   **Content:** `R, s, g1(y), Signature`\n*   **Signature Details:** The signature is created using the Responder's private key (`sk(R)`). The signed data is a tuple containing: the Responder's identity, the session nonce `s`, the Responder's public value `g1(y)`, the Initiator's public value `alpha` (which is `g1(x)`), and the Initiator's identity.\n    *   **Signed Tuple:** `{ R, s, g1(y), alpha, I }sk(R)`\n\n**Message 3: I -> R**\nUpon receiving the second message and verifying the signature, the Initiator completes the exchange by sending its own signature for mutual authentication.\n*   **Content:** `I, s, Signature`\n*   **Signature Details:** The signature is created using the Initiator's private key (`sk(I)`). The signed data is a tuple containing: the Initiator's identity, the session nonce `s`, the Initiator's public value `g1(x)`, the Responder's public value `beta` (which is `g1(y)`), and the Responder's identity.\n    *   **Signed Tuple:** `{ I, s, g1(x), beta, R }sk(I)`\n\n#### 4. Security Claims\n\nAt the end of the protocol run, both roles make security claims.\n\n**Session Identifier (SID):**\n*   Both **I** and **R** claim that the session is uniquely identified by the nonce `s`.\n    *   `claim(I, SID, s)`\n    *   `claim(R, SID, s)`\n\n**Shared Secret Key (SKR):**\n*   Both **I** and **R** claim to have established a shared secret key. The key is derived from their private exponent and the public value received from the other party.\n*   **Initiator's Key Calculation:** `g2(beta, x)`, where `beta` is the received `g1(y)`.\n    *   `claim(I, SKR, g2(beta, x))`\n*   **Responder's Key Calculation:** `g2(alpha, y)`, where `alpha` is the received `g1(x)`.\n    *   `claim(R, SKR, g2(alpha, y))`\n\nThe `@exponentiation` helper protocol ensures that Scyther understands that `g2(g1(y), x)` is equal to `g2(g1(x), y)`, confirming that both parties derive the same key."]]}, "SPDL-1/skeme-basic.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/*\n * Scyther-parsable declarations.\n * These are added to make the file self-contained and runnable.\n */\nusertype Agent, Nonce, Ticket, PublicKey, PrivateKey;\nconst pk: Agent -> PublicKey;\ninversekeys (pk, sk);\n\n/*\n * The original SPDL code follows, with added security claims.\n * The original C preprocessor directives are preserved as comments.\n */\n\n# 1 \"skeme-basic.cpp\"\n# 1 \"<command-line>\"\n# 1 \"skeme-basic.cpp\"\n# 21 \"skeme-basic.cpp\"\n# 1 \"common.h\" 1\n\n// Hash functions used in the protocol\nhashfunction prf, KDF;\nhashfunction g, h;\n\n# 97 \"common.h\"\n/*\n * This oracle protocol models the algebraic properties of the\n * Diffie-Hellman key exchange for Scyther.\n * It establishes that h(g(x), y) is equivalent to h(g(y), x),\n * which corresponds to (g^y)^x = (g^x)^y.\n */\nprotocol @oracle (DH, SWAP) {\n\n role DH {\n  var i, r: Nonce;\n\n  recv_!DH1( DH, DH, h(g(r),i) );\n  send_!DH2( DH, DH, h(g(i),r) );\n }\n\n role SWAP {\n  var i, r, Ni, Nr: Nonce;\n# 150 \"common.h\"\n  recv_!SWAP1( SWAP, SWAP, KDF(h(g(r),i)) );\n  send_!SWAP2( SWAP, SWAP, KDF(h(g(i),r)) );\n\n }\n}\n\n# 22 \"skeme-basic.cpp\" 2\n\n/*\n * The SKEME protocol, basic version.\n * I is the initiator, R is the responder.\n */\nprotocol skeme-basic(I, R)\n{\n role I {\n  fresh i, Ni: Nonce;\n  var Nr: Nonce;\n  var Gr: Ticket;\n\n  send_1( I, R, {I, Ni}pk(R), g(i) );\n  recv_2( R, I, {Nr}pk(I), Gr, prf(prf(Ni,Nr), g(i), Gr, R, I) );\n  send_3( I, R, prf(prf(Ni,Nr), Gr, g(i), I, R) );\n\n  /* Original Claims */\n  claim( I, SKR, KDF(h(Gr,i)) );\n  claim( I, Alive );\n  claim( I, Weakagree );\n\n  /* Added annotations for security property verification */\n  // Secrecy of the derived session key\n  claim( I, Secret, KDF(h(Gr,i)) );\n  // Authenticity of the responder's nonce Nr\n  claim( I, Nragree );\n  // Commitment to the session key, ensuring R has matching key.

As a Scyther expert, I can provide a detailed description of the `skeme-basic` protocol based on the provided SPDL file. This description is structured to be clear and precise, allowing for the recreation of the SPDL file.\n\n### Protocol Description: skeme-basic\n\nThis document describes the **skeme-basic** protocol, a key exchange protocol between two parties, an Initiator `I` and a Responder `R`. The protocol aims to establish a shared secret key.\n\n---\n\n#### 1. Participants\n\n*   **I**: The Initiator of the protocol.\n*   **R**: The Responder of the protocol.\n\n#### 2. Cryptographic Assumptions and Functions\n\nThe protocol relies on the following cryptographic primitives and a public-key infrastructure (PKI):\n\n*   **Public/Private Keys**: Each participant `A` has a public key `pk(A)` and a corresponding private key `sk(A)`. Encryption is denoted as `{M}pk(A)`.\n*   **Nonce**: A randomly generated number used only once.\n*   **Hash Functions**:\n    *   `prf`: A pseudo-random function used for creating Message Authentication Codes (MACs).\n    *   `KDF`: A Key Derivation Function used to derive the final session key.\n    *   `g`: A function modeling exponentiation for a Diffie-Hellman exchange (e.g., `g(x)` can be thought of as `g^x mod p`).\n    *   `h`: A function modeling the combination of a public Diffie-Hellman value with a private exponent to derive a shared secret (e.g., `h(g^y, x)` can be thought of as `(g^y)^x mod p`).\n\n#### 3. Roles and Variables\n\n**Role: Initiator (I)**\n*   **Generates Fresh Values:**\n    *   `i`: A fresh nonce, serving as the private exponent for the Diffie-Hellman exchange.\n    *   `Ni`: A fresh nonce for challenges and key derivation.\n*   **Receives and Stores:**\n    *   `Nr`: The Responder's nonce.\n    *   `Gr`: The Responder's public Diffie-Hellman value, corresponding to `g(r)`.\n\n**Role: Responder (R)**\n*   **Generates Fresh Values:**\n    *   `r`: A fresh nonce, serving as the private exponent for the Diffie-Hellman exchange.\n    *   `Nr`: A fresh nonce for challenges and key derivation.\n*   **Receives and Stores:**\n    *   `Ni`: The Initiator's nonce.\n    *   `Gi`: The Initiator's public Diffie-Hellman value, corresponding to `g(i)`.\n\n---\n\n#### 4. Protocol Steps (Message Exchange)\n\nThe protocol consists of three messages:\n\n**Message 1: I -> R**\nThe Initiator `I` starts the protocol by sending its identity, a nonce, and its public Diffie-Hellman value to the Responder `R`.\n\n*   **Content:** ` {I, Ni}pk(R), g(i) `\n    *   **Part 1:** The identity `I` and the fresh nonce `Ni` are concatenated and encrypted with the Responder's public key `pk(R)`.\n    *   **Part 2:** The Initiator's public Diffie-Hellman value `g(i)`, which is sent in the clear.\n\n**Message 2: R -> I**\nThe Responder `R`, after decrypting Message 1, replies with its own nonce, its public Diffie-Hellman value, and a MAC to authenticate the exchange so far.\n\n*   **Content:** ` {Nr}pk(I), g(r), prf(prf(Ni,Nr), g(i), g(r), R, I) `\n    *   **Part 1:** The Responder's fresh nonce `Nr` is encrypted with the Initiator's public key `pk(I)`.\n    *   **Part 2:** The Responder's public Diffie-Hellman value `g(r)`, which is sent in the clear.\n    *   **Part 3:** A Message Authentication Code (MAC) for integrity and authentication.\n        *   **Key:** The MAC key is derived from the two nonces: `prf(Ni, Nr)`.\n        *   **Authenticated Data:** The MAC is computed over the concatenation of the Initiator's public value (`g(i)`), the Responder's public value (`g(r)`), the Responder's identity (`R`), and the Initiator's identity (`I`).\n\n**Message 3: I -> R**\nThe Initiator `I`, upon receiving and verifying Message 2, sends a final MAC to the Responder `R` to confirm the exchange and authenticate itself.\n\n*   **Content:** ` prf(prf(Ni,Nr), g(r), g(i), I, R) `\n    *   **MAC:** A Message Authentication Code.\n        *   **Key:** The same MAC key is used: `prf(Ni, Nr)`.\n        *   **Authenticated Data:** The MAC is computed over the concatenation of the Responder's public value (`g(r)`), the Initiator's public value (`g(i)`), the Initiator's identity (`I`), and the Responder's identity (`R`). Note the order of `g(r)` and `g(i)` is swapped compared to Message 2.\n\n---\n\n#### 5. Session Key Derivation\n\nAfter the successful exchange of the three messages, both parties can compute the shared session key.\n\n*   **Initiator (I) computes the key as:** `KDF(h(Gr, i))`\n    *   Where `Gr` is the `g(r)` received from the Responder in Message 2. This is equivalent to `KDF(h(g(r), i))`.\n*   **Responder (R) computes the key as:** `KDF(h(Gi, r))`\n    *   Where `Gi` is the `g(i)` received from the Initiator in Message 1. This is equivalent to `KDF(h(g(i), r))`.\n\nThe resulting keys are identical due to the properties of the Diffie-Hellman exchange modeled by functions `g` and `h`.\n\n#### 6. Security Claims\n\nAt the end of the protocol, both `I` and `R` make the following security claims:\n\n*   **`SKR`**: Both parties claim the secrecy of the derived session key. They believe it is known only to `I` and `R`.\n*   **`Alive`**: Both parties claim that their peer is alive and has recently participated in the protocol run.\n*   **`Weakagree`**: Both parties claim they have completed their role in the protocol."]]}}
