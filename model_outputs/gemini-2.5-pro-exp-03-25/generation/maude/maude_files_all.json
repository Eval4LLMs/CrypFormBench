This hierarchy is standard in Maude-NPA.\n\n3.  **Operators**:\n    *   `a, b, s, i`: Concrete agents Alice, Bob, Server, and Intruder. `[ctor]` means they are constructors.\n    *   `mkey(Agt, Agt)`: Master key function (e.g., `mkey(a,s)` is Alice's master key shared with the server).\n    *   `seskey(Agt, Agt, Nonce)`: Session key function (e.g., `seskey(a,b,TS)` is a session key for Alice and Bob associated with nonce `TS`).\n    *   `_;_`: Message concatenation (associative, identity `null`, precedence 70).\n    *   `e(Key, Msg)`: Encryption (precedence 65).\n    *   `d(Key, Msg)`: Decryption (precedence 65). Importantly, `d` is *not* a `[ctor]`, meaning the intruder cannot use `d` to form new messages; it's only used in the equational theory.\n\n4.  **Variables**: Standard Maude variable declarations for use in equations and strands.\n\n5.  **Equations**:\n    *   `eq d(e(M,K),K) = M .`: Defines perfect cryptography (decrypting an encrypted message with the correct key yields the original message).\n\n6.  **Roles**:\n    *   `alice`, `server`, `bob`: Operators representing the roles in the protocol.\n    *   `eq strand(role, params...) = [ ... ] .`: Defines the sequence of actions for each role.\n        *   `A :: Agt`, `KAB :: Key`, etc., inside messages: These bind received message parts to local strand variables of the specified sort.\n        *   `out(msg)`: Sends `msg`.\n        *   `in(msg)`: Receives `msg`.\n        *   `fresh(TS :: Nonce)`: Generates a fresh nonce `TS` (in the server role).\n        *   `let KAB :: Key := ...`: Defines a local strand variable (e.g., the server defines `KAB`).\n        *   `claim(...)`: States a security property or fact at a point in the protocol execution.\n            *   `claim(Agent, Secret, Key)`: Claims that `Key` should remain secret from the intruder (unless `Agent` is the intruder or shares the key with the intruder).\n            *   `claim(Agent1, Agree, Agent2, Data)`: Claims that `Agent1` agrees with `Agent2` on `Data`. This is a common way to model authentication.\n\n7.  **Protocol Steps in Strands**:\n    *   **Alice's role**:\n        1.  Sends her identity `A` and intended recipient `B` to server `S`.\n        2.  Receives the server's response, encrypted with `mkey(A,S)`. This contains the session key `KAB`, nonce `TS`, and an encrypted package `EAB` for Bob.\n        3.  Forwards `EAB` to Bob.\n        4.  Claims secrecy of `KAB` and agreement with `B` on `(KAB ; TS)`.\n    *   **Server's role**:\n        1.  Receives `SERVERPARTNERA` (Alice's identity) and `SERVERPARTNERB` (Bob's identity).\n        2.  Generates a fresh nonce `TS` and a session key `KAB = seskey(SERVERPARTNERA, SERVERPARTNERB, TS)`.\n        3.  Sends the bundled message (containing `KAB`, `TS`, and the encrypted part for Bob) back to `SERVERPARTNERA` (Alice), encrypted with `mkey(SERVERPARTNERA,S)`.\n    *   **Bob's role**:\n        1.  Receives the message `EAB` (which is `e(mkey(B,S), (KAB ; ARECV ; TS))`) from Alice.\n        2.  Decrypts it with `mkey(B,S)` to get `KAB`, `ARECV` (Alice's identity as received), and `TS`.\n        3.  Claims secrecy of `KAB` and agreement with `ARECV` on `(KAB ; TS)`.\n\n### How to Analyze with Maude-NPA:\n\nThis `.maude` file (e.g., `denning-sacco.maude`) would be loaded into Maude along with `maude-npa.maude`.\nThen, you would typically run Maude-NPA commands, often from a separate command file or interactively. These commands specify:\n\n*   **Initial State**: Which principals are involved (e.g., `a`, `b`, `s`, `i`), their initial knowledge (e.g., intruder knows `mkey(i,s)`), which keys are \"noninteractive\" (known only to the specified parties, e.g., `mkey(a,s)` is noninteractive).\n*   **Strand Instantiation**: How many strands of each role to consider in the analysis (e.g., one Alice, one Bob, one Server).\n*   **Attack States**: Patterns that define a security compromise. For example:\n    *   **Secrecy Violation**: The intruder knows `KAB` where `KAB = seskey(a,b,TS)`.\n        ```maude\n        (search [1] in DENNING-SACCO-PROTOCOL :\n          init =>* state(PRS,\u5df4CS,PSET,\u0399\u039a)\n          such that\n            isKey(KAB :: Key)\n            and KAB := seskey(a,b,TS :: Nonce)\n            and KAB in IK\n        .)\n        ```\n    *   **Authentication Failure**: Alice `a` completes the protocol apparently with Bob `b` (agreeing on `KAB, TS`), but Bob `b` either did not run, or ran with a different Alice, or different `KAB, TS`.\n        ```maude\n        (search [1] in DENNING-SACCO-PROTOCOL :\n          init =>* state(PRS,\u5df4CS,PSET,\u0399\u039a)\n          such that\n            claim(a, Agree, b, (KAB :: Key ; TS :: Nonce)) in PSET\n            and not (claim(b, Agree, a, (KAB ; TS)) in PSET)\n        .)\n        ```\n\nThese search commands initiate a symbolic reachability analysis to find states matching the attack patterns. Maude-NPA will report \"No solution\" if the attack state is unreachable (protocol is secure w.r.t. that property and bounds) or provide a trace to the attack if one is found."]], "MAUDE-1/maa-crc.maude": [[true, "---- Part 1: Basic cryptographic types (Bit, Octet, Block) and their operations\nfmod CRYPTO-BASE is\n  pr NAT . --- For using natural numbers, e.g., in genericBlock or segment operations\n\n  sorts Bit Octet Block .\n\n  --- Bit constructors\n  op x0 : -> Bit [ctor] .\n  op x1 : -> Bit [ctor] .\n\n  --- Octet constructor (from 8 bits)\n  op buildOctet : Bit Bit Bit Bit Bit Bit Bit Bit -> Octet [ctor] .\n\n  --- Block sort relationship and generic constructor\n  subsort Octet < Block . --- An Octet is a specific type of Block\n  op genericBlock : Nat -> Block [ctor] . --- For creating distinct abstract blocks not necessarily defined by octets\n\n  --- Bitwise logical operations\n  op xorBit : Bit Bit -> Bit .\n  op andBit : Bit Bit -> Bit .\n  op orBit : Bit Bit -> Bit .\n\n  eq xorBit(x0, x0) = x0 .\n  eq xorBit(x0, x1) = x1 .\n  eq xorBit(x1, x0) = x1 .\n  eq xorBit(x1, x1) = x0 .\n\n  eq andBit(x0, B:Bit) = x0 .\n  eq andBit(x1, B:Bit) = B .\n\n  eq orBit(x0, B:Bit) = B .\n  eq orBit(x1, B:Bit) = x1 .\n\n  --- Arithmetic operations (as described)\n  --- addBit: Assuming modulo 2 addition (XOR) as it's common and simple.\n  op addBit : Bit Bit -> Bit .\n  eq addBit(B1:Bit, B2:Bit) = xorBit(B1, B2) .\n\n  --- addOctet and addBlock: Defined as abstract operations.\n  --- Their specific behavior (e.g., modular arithmetic, carry bits) would require detailed equations.\n  op addOctet : Octet Octet -> Octet .\n  op addBlock : Block Block -> Block .\nendfm\n\n---- Part 2: Protocol specific types (Key, MessageData for MAA) and the MAA function\nfmod MAC-PROTOCOL-SPEC is\n  pr CRYPTO-BASE .\n  pr SIGNATURE . --- Provides basic Maude-NPA sorts like Msg, Fresh, Nat, Principal\n  pr EQUATIONAL-THEORY . --- For defining user-specific equational theories\n\n  --- Protocol-specific sorts\n  sort Key .\n  sort MessageData . --- Represents \"Messages: Sequences of blocks\" which is the input to MAA\n\n  --- Subsort relationships for Maude-NPA compatibility\n  subsort Key < Fresh .         --- Keys are unguessable fresh values\n  subsort Block < Msg .         --- Blocks (e.g., MAC output) can be part of general messages\n  subsort MessageData < Msg .   --- The MessageData structure itself can be sent as a message or part of one\n  subsort Principal < Msg .     --- Principals can be identified in messages\n\n  --- Constructors for MessageData (as a sequence of blocks)\n  op unitMessage : Block -> MessageData [ctor] .        --- Creates a MessageData with a single block\n  op consMessage : Block MessageData -> MessageData [ctor] . --- Prepends a block to a MessageData sequence\n\n  --- Key constructor (keys are built from Blocks as per description)\n  op buildKey : Block -> Key [ctor] .\n\n  --- Core Cryptographic Function: MAA (Message Authentication Code)\n  --- Takes a Key and a MessageData sequence, produces a Block (the MAC value)\n  --- Marked [frozen] so the intruder cannot decompose it without the key.\n  op MAA : Key MessageData -> Block [frozen] .\n\n  --- Message Handling Operations (operating on MessageData as per description)\n  --- These are defined with signatures; their specific equational behavior would be complex\n  --- and is not fully detailed in the input.

Adjust the path as needed.\n*   **` (set-output ...)`:** These redirect Maude's output, which is useful for logging unification results.\n*   **Sorts and Subsorts:**\n    *   I've declared `Element`, `Pair`, `List`, `Foo`, `FooId`, `Lo`, `Hi` as needed.\n    *   All are made subsorts of `Msg` for general compatibility, though for pure unification tests, this isn't strictly necessary if they don't interact.\n    *   `FooId < Foo` and `Lo < Hi` are explicitly defined as per the descriptions.\n*   **Operators:**\n    *   List concatenation `__` is `assoc id: nil`. `nil` is `[ctor id]`.\n    *   Generic associative operator `_*_` is `assoc id: e`. `e` is `[ctor id]`.\n    *   `metadata FORMAT (nil mnil)` is added to associative operators, which helps Maude-NPA's internal handling and can affect how solutions are presented or searched for, especially with empty sequences.\n    *   Constants like `pConst`, `a`, `b`, `lConst`, `hConst`, `k`, `l`, `m` are defined as `op`s with `[ctor]`.\n*   **Variables:** Unification variables (`A`, `B`, `C`, `X`, `Y`, `Z`, etc.) are declared with `vars V : Sort .`. Maude-NPA typically expects these to be uppercase.\n*   **Unification Problems `(unify in ... : { ... } .)`:**\n    *   **ASSOC-LIST1:** The core is `pConst = <A,B>`. The \"constrained variable P\" is interpreted as a constant `pConst` being unified with a term containing unification variables `A, B`.\n    *   **ASSOC-LIST2:** The canonical example for `tightenConstraints` is unifying a list of known length (three elements `e2l(E1) e2l(E2) e2l(E3)`) with a concatenation of list variables `A B C`. This forces `A`, `B`, `C` to each represent a single element list.\n    *   **FOO:**\n        *   The identity `e` is declared as `op e : -> FooId [ctor id] .`. This means `e` has the subsort `FooId`. When used as identity for `_*_ : Foo Foo -> Foo`, this inherently creates a sort-decreasing context for `e`.\n        *   Unification 1: `(X * a) = a`. A standard case where `X -> e` is a solution.\n        *   Unification 2: `b = e [irred]`. If `b` is a general `Foo` constant and `e` is `FooId`, this equality forces `b` to be of sort `FooId`. If `b` cannot be shown to be `FooId` (e.g., `b` is a distinct constructor not related to `FooId` by other equations), the unification problem is irreducible. This tests the \"disruption\" by the sort-decreasing nature of `e`.\n    *   **FOO2:**\n        *   The identity `e` is `op e : -> Lo [ctor id] .` for `_*_ : Hi Hi -> Hi`.\n        *   The system `{ (X * lConst) = lConst , (Y * X) = hConst }` tests the interaction. The first equation suggests `X=e` (so `X` becomes `Lo`). The second equation then becomes `(Y * e) = hConst` (i.e., `Y = hConst`), where `Y` (type `Hi`) interacts with `e` (type `Lo`). This setup is good for testing how the solver handles substitutions involving subsorts and identity elements.\n    *   **FOO3:** This module tests various combinations of `Hi` and `Lo` sorts in unification with the `_*_ : Hi Hi -> Hi` operator whose identity `e` is `Lo`.\n        *   `(X * k) = m`: `X:Hi, k:Lo, m:Hi`. `(Hi * Lo)` results in `Hi`. `Hi = Hi`.\n        *   `(X * m) = k`: `X:Hi, m:Hi, k:Lo`. `(Hi * Hi)` results in `Hi`. `Hi = Lo`. This forces the term `(X*m)` to actually be of sort `Lo`.\n        *   `(X * Y) = Z`: `X:Hi, Y:Hi, Z:Lo`. `(Hi * Hi)` results in `Hi`. `Hi = Lo`. Similar to above, forces `(X*Y)` to be `Lo`.\n\nThis Maude file should provide a good basis for testing the described unification scenarios within Maude-NPA.

We'll model the key encapsulation mechanism at a high level, focusing on the exchange of keys and ciphertexts, and the resulting shared secret.\n\nThe core idea of a Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) like BIKE is:\n1.  One party (say, Bob) has a key pair (private `skB`, public `pkB`).\n2.  Another party (Alice) wants to establish a shared secret with Bob.\n3.  Alice uses Bob's public key `pkB` to *encapsulate* a secret. This process generates a ciphertext `CT` and a shared secret `SSK`. Alice sends `CT` to Bob.\n4.  Bob uses his private key `skB` and the received `CT` to *decapsulate* and derive the same shared secret `SSK`.\n\nWe'll model:\n*   `pk(PrivateKey)`: generates a public key from a private key.\n*   `kem-enc(PublicKey, FreshValue)`: performs encapsulation, returning a pair of (Ciphertext, SharedSecretKey). We'll use helper functions `getCT` and `getSSK` to extract these.\n*   `kem-dec(PrivateKey, Ciphertext)`: performs decapsulation, returning the SharedSecretKey.\n\nThe intruder `E` will operate under the standard Dolev-Yao model, able to intercept, modify, and inject messages.\n\nHere's the Maude-NPA code:\n\n```maude\n(fmod BIKE-PROTOCOL is\n  inc SWP-PROTOCOL . --- Include standard Maude-NPA definitions\n\n  --- Sorts specific to BIKE\n  sorts Fresh SKey PKey PrKey CipherT KeyPair .\n  subsort Fresh < Msg .\n  subsort SKey < Msg .\n  subsort PKey < Msg .\n  subsort PrKey < Msg . --- Private keys are not usually messages, but intruder might learn them.\n  subsort CipherT < Msg .\n  --- KeyPair is an internal structure, not directly a message.\n\n  --- Cryptographic Operations\n  op pk      : PrKey -> PKey            [ctor] . --- Public key generation\n  op kem-enc : PKey Fresh -> KeyPair    [ctor] . --- KEM Encapsulation (generates CT and SSK)\n  op getCT   : KeyPair -> CipherT .              --- Extracts Ciphertext from KeyPair\n  op getSSK  : KeyPair -> SKey .                 --- Extracts Shared Secret Key from KeyPair\n  op kem-dec : PrKey CipherT -> SKey .           --- KEM Decapsulation\n\n  --- Abstract constructors for ciphertext and shared key components.\n  --- These help define the equational theory for KEM.\n  op bikeCiph : PKey Fresh -> CipherT [ctor] .\n  op bikeSKey : PKey Fresh -> SKey    [ctor] .\n\n  --- Equations defining cryptographic properties\n  vars PrK : PrKey . vars PuK : PKey . vars M : Fresh .\n  eq getCT(kem-enc(PuK, M)) = bikeCiph(PuK, M) .\n  eq getSSK(kem-enc(PuK, M)) = bikeSKey(PuK, M) .\n  eq kem-dec(PrK, bikeCiph(pk(PrK), M)) = bikeSKey(pk(PrK), M) .\n  --- This last equation is crucial: decapsulating a ciphertext generated\n  --- with the corresponding public key yields the correct shared secret.\n\n  --- Protocol Strands\n  --- Alice's role: obtains Bob's public key, encapsulates a secret, sends ciphertext.\n  --- A: Alice (initiator of KEM encapsulation), B: Bob (owner of PKey)\n  --- SKa: Alice's private key (not directly used in this KEM flow for encapsulation,\n  ---      but good practice to include if Alice has an identity key)\n  --- PKb: Bob's public key\n  --- Mval: Fresh value used by Alice for KEM encapsulation\n  strand alice-role (A:AId, B:AId, PKb:PKey, Mval:Fresh)\n  [\n    recv(PKb),                                      --- Receives Bob's public key\n    send(getCT(kem-enc(PKb, Mval))),                --- Sends ciphertext to Bob\n    claim(A, alice-shared-key, B, getSSK(kem-enc(PKb, Mval))) --- Alice claims she shares SSK with B\n  ].\n\n  --- Bob's role: sends his public key, receives ciphertext, decapsulates.\n  --- B: Bob (responder), A: Alice (intended sender of ciphertext)\n  --- SKb: Bob's private key\n  --- CT: Ciphertext received from Alice\n  strand bob-role (B:AId, A:AId, SKb:PrKey, CT:CipherT)\n  [\n    send(pk(SKb)),                                  --- Bob sends his public key\n    recv(CT),                                       --- Receives ciphertext\n    claim(B, bob-shared-key, A, kem-dec(SKb, CT))   --- Bob claims he shares SSK with A\n  ].\n\n  --- Initial State Specification\n  section BIKE-ANALYSIS\n    vars A B E : AId .      --- Alice, Bob, Eve (Intruder)\n    vars SKa SKb SKe : PrKey . --- Private keys\n    vars PKb : PKey .\n    vars CT : CipherT .\n    vars Mval : Fresh .      --- Fresh value for KEM\n\n    --- Principals and their initial knowledge\n    --- Alice knows her identity, Bob's identity, Bob's public key (somehow obtained),\n    --- and a fresh value M for encapsulation.\n    principal alice(A, B, PKb, Mval) plays alice-role\n    {\n      iknows(A), iknows(B), iknows(PKb), iknows(Mval)\n      --- In a more complex scenario, Alice might have her own SKa,\n      --- but for this KEM, it's not strictly needed for encapsulation.\n      --- We assume PKb is authentic for this run.

It takes a public key and a fresh value, and produces a `KeyPair` (which conceptually holds both the ciphertext and the shared key).\n    *   `getCT`, `getSSK`: Helper functions to extract the ciphertext and shared secret key from the `KeyPair`.\n    *   `kem-dec`: Models KEM decapsulation. Takes a private key and a ciphertext, returns the shared key.\n    *   `bikeCiph`, `bikeSKey`: These are helper constructors. They allow us to define the behavior of `kem-dec` precisely: `kem-dec` only works if the ciphertext was indeed formed using the public key corresponding to the private key used for decryption.\n3.  **Equations:** The core equation `eq kem-dec(PrK, bikeCiph(pk(PrK), M)) = bikeSKey(pk(PrK), M) .` states that decryption with `PrK` of a ciphertext generated using `pk(PrK)` (the corresponding public key) yields the correct shared secret. This models the \"perfect reconstruction of errors\" mentioned.\n4.  **Strands:**\n    *   `alice-role`: Alice receives Bob's public key `PKb`, generates a fresh value `Mval`, computes `kem-enc(PKb, Mval)`, sends the ciphertext part, and claims the shared secret part.\n    *   `bob-role`: Bob sends his public key `pk(SKb)`, receives a ciphertext `CT`, and computes `kem-dec(SKb, CT)` to get the shared secret. He then claims this secret.\n5.  **Principals & Intruder:**\n    *   `alice` and `bob` principals define the initial knowledge for honest participants playing these roles.\n    *   `intruder E` defines the intruder's initial knowledge (e.g., their own keys).\n6.  **Security Properties:**\n    *   `secrecy-of-ssk`: This is an `attack-state` definition. An attack is found if the intruder `E` learns a shared secret `SSK` that was established between two honest parties `A` and `B`.\n    *   `alice-auth-bob`: An example `authentication_property`. It checks if Alice's claim of sharing a key with Bob implies Bob also claims sharing the same key with Alice. (The precise syntax and semantics of these properties might require consulting the specific Maude-NPA version's documentation for advanced checks).\n\nThis Maude-NPA specification provides a formal model of the BIKE KEM protocol focusing on its key exchange aspects, ready for analysis regarding secrecy and authentication. Remember that \"polynomials\" and \"pairs for error values\" are abstracted away into the cryptographic operations, which is typical for Dolev-Yao style analysis."]],

Maude-NPA matches the message if it could have been formed using the private key `sk(TheirKeyId)`.\n        *   `claim(Self, Niagree, Adv, n(MyNonce, Self))`: A security claim. If the server `Self` makes this claim about client `Adv` and nonce `MyNonce`, Maude-NPA will verify that `Adv` indeed ran the client role and committed to this nonce with `Self`. This is crucial for authentication.\n    *   **`intruderKnowledge`**:\n        *   Lists what the Dolev-Yao intruder initially knows (agent identities, its own key pair `ikid`, `sk(ikid)`). The intruder can also learn messages from the network and apply cryptographic operations.\n\nThis Maude-NPA code provides a solid basis for formally analyzing the security properties of your NAT Authentication Protocol, particularly client authentication to the server and protection against replays due to fresh nonces."]], "MAUDE-1/conditionSideEffectInStrategyLanguageDecember2023.maude": [[true, "mod NONEXEC is\n  sorts Foo Bar .\n\n  op a : -> Foo [ctor] .\n  op b : -> Foo [ctor] .\n  op <_> : Foo -> Bar [ctor] .\n\n  vars F G : Foo .\n\n  crl < F > => < G > if F => G /\\ F =/= G .\n\n  rl [ab] : a => b [nonexec] .\nendm", "```maude\nmod NONEXEC is\n  sorts Foo Bar .\n\n  op a : -> Foo [ctor] .\n  op b : -> Foo [ctor] .\n  op <_> : Foo -> Bar [ctor] .\n\n  vars F G : Foo .\n\n  crl < F > => < G > if F => G /\\ F =/= G .\n\n  rl [ab] : a => b [nonexec] .\nendm\n```"]], "MAUDE-1/CUIbug12-22-09.maude": [[true, "mod CUI-BUG2 is\n  sort Foo .\n  ops a b c d 1 : -> Foo .\n  op f : Foo Foo -> Foo  [id: 1] .\n  op g : Foo -> Foo .\n\n  rl b => c .\n  rl g(c) => d .\nendm\n\nrew f(a, g(b)) .", "Okay, I understand.

(Used in `FOO-UL-THEORY`)\n    *   **`r-id: 1f`**: Declares `1f` as the right identity for `f`, i.e., `f(X, 1f) = X`. (Used in `FOO2-UR-THEORY`)\n    *   **`id: 1f`**: Declares `1f` as the neutral (two-sided) identity for `f`, i.e., `f(1f, X) = X` and `f(X, 1f) = X`. (Used in `FOO3-U-THEORY` and `FOO4-CU-THEORY`)\n    *   **`comm`**: Declares that `f` is commutative, i.e., `f(X,Y) = f(Y,X)`. (Used in `FOO4-CU-THEORY`)\n*   **Unification**: The Maude attributes (`assoc`, `comm`, `id:`, etc.) automatically configure Maude's built-in unification algorithms for these equational theories. Maude-NPA relies on this mechanism. Your description of unification allowing \"unification of terms involving f, including cases where one term is a variable and the other is an application of f\" is standard behavior for these theories in Maude.\n\nThis set of modules defines the algebraic properties for the operator `f` and constant `1f` on sort `Foo` as per your specifications for each of the four theories.

Using `ctor` helps in term construction and matching.\n    *   `pk(K, M)`: Public key encryption of message `M` with key `K`. `ctor` indicates it's a constructor.\n    *   `sk(K, M)`: Abstract private key decryption. Its behavior is defined by equations.\n5.  **Variables**: Typed variables used in equations and strands.\n6.  **Equations**:\n    *   `eq sk(privK(P), pk(pubK(P), M)) = M .`: Defines the core cryptographic property: decrypting a message (that was encrypted with `P`'s public key) using `P`'s private key yields the original message.\n7.  **Strands**:\n    *   `strand alice (A B : Prin, NA NB : Nonce) := ...`: Defines Alice's role.\n        *   `fresh(NA)`: Alice generates a fresh nonce `NA` for this strand instance.\n        *   `+ M`: Sends message `M`.\n        *   `- M`: Receives message `M`.\n        *   The messages `pk(pubK(B), (A ; NA))`, etc., match the protocol description.\n    *   `strand bob (A B : Prin, NA NB : Nonce) := ...`: Defines Bob's role.\n        *   `fresh(NB)`: Bob generates a fresh nonce `NB`.\n8.  **`principal(principalName, privateKeyTerm)`**: Declares honest principals and their private keys. This tells Maude-NPA that these keys are protected unless the principal is compromised (i.e., is the intruder `i`). The intruder `i` automatically knows `privK(i)`.\n9.  **`search [1] init ... => ... .`**: This is the command for Maude-NPA to search for attack states.\n    *   `[1]`: Search for at most 1 attack state.\n    *   **`init ...`**: Defines the initial state of the system.\n        *   Instances of Alice's and Bob's strands are created. `na` and `nb` are nonce *variables* that will be instantiated by the `fresh` declarations within the strands.\n        *   `iknows(...)`: Specifies the intruder's initial knowledge (identities of `a`, `b`, `i`; all public keys; and its own private key).\n    *   **`=> ...`**: Defines the attack state patterns.\n        *   **Secrecy of NA/NB**: Checks if the intruder can learn `NA` (or `NB`) when it was intended for an honest party. `PA =/= i` and `PB =/= i` specify that the principals involved in the strand are honest.\n        *   **Alice authenticates Bob**: Checks if Alice completes her protocol run (reaches state `@ 3`) believing she's talking to `PB` (an honest Bob, `PB =/= i`), but `PB` never actually sent message 2 (`bob(PA, PB, NAATT, NBATT) @ 2`) in that specific session context.\n        *   **Bob authenticates Alice**: Checks if Bob completes his protocol run believing he's talking to `PA` (an honest Alice, `PA =/= i`), but `PA` never actually sent message 1 (`alice(PA, PB, NAATT, NBATT) @ 1`) in that specific session context.\n\nThis Maude-NPA code provides a solid foundation for analyzing the security properties of the Needham-Schroeder-Lowe Modified Protocol.

Based on `createTimer(timeManager, me)`, the parameters are likely `(targetManager, requester)`.\n    *   `op deleteTimer : Oid Oid -> Msg .`: Defines the `deleteTimer` message. Based on `deleteTimer(O3, me)`, the parameters are likely `(timerId, requester)`.\n    *   `op createdTimer : Oid Oid Oid -> Msg .`: Defines the `createdTimer` message. Based on `createdTimer(O, O2, O3)`, parameters are `(objectForTimer, manager, timerId)`.\n\n4.  **Variables:**\n    *   `vars O O2 O3 : Oid .`: Declares `O`, `O2`, `O3` as variables of sort `Oid`.\n\n5.  **Rule:**\n    *   `rl [myClassRuleDeleteTimer] : < O : myClass | none > createdTimer(O, O2, O3) => < O : myClass | none > deleteTimer(O3, me) .`\n        *   This rule models: An object `O` of `myClass` in state `none`, upon receiving a `createdTimer(O, O2, O3)` message (where `O` is the recipient for whom the timer is created, `O2` is the manager, and `O3` is the timer ID), will transition (in this case, stays in `<O : myClass | none>`) and send the message `deleteTimer(O3, me)`.\n        *   In this `deleteTimer(O3, me)` message, `O3` is the ID of the timer to be deleted, and `me` is the Oid specified as the original requester of the deletion.

An available chopstick `J` is represented as an object `< J : Chopstick >` in the configuration.\n    *   The `grab-stick` rule consumes this object.\n    *   The `stop-eating` rule recreates these chopstick objects.\n4.  **Philosopher State:**\n    *   The `chopsticks` attribute correctly tracks the *count* of chopsticks held.\n    *   The `timer` attribute is used for both `THINKING-TIME` and `EATING-TIME`.\n5.  **Rule Corrections and Refinements:**\n    *   **`grab-stick`:** The condition for grabbing a chopstick `J` by philosopher `P` correctly checks if `J` is `P` (left) or `(P + 1) % NUM_PHIL` (right), using `NUM_PHIL` for generality.\n    *   **`stop-eating`:** The philosopher must have `chopsticks : 2` to stop eating. This was corrected from the example's potential `chopsticks : 0`. It correctly recreates the two chopsticks `P` and `(P + 1) % NUM_PHIL`.\n    *   **`get-hungry`:** A thinking philosopher becomes hungry when their `timer` reaches `0`.\n6.  **Initialization (`initState`):**\n    *   Philosophers are initialized in the `thinking` state with their `timer` set to `THINKING-TIME`. This means they will think for the specified duration before trying to eat for the first time. This is a common interpretation, though your example had `timer:0` (immediate hunger).\n    *   The recursive helper `genPhilosophersAndChopsticks` creates philosophers indexed from `NUM_PHIL - 1` down to `0`.\n7.  **Time Management:**\n    *   This model uses local timers on philosophers. Rules trigger when a timer reaches `0`.\n    *   The global time `T` in `{Conf, T}` is present but not explicitly advanced by these rules. For more complex time-dependent analysis (e.g., using Maude's timed modules), you would add rules to advance global time and decrement active timers.\n8.  **Verification:**\n    *   The model inherently prevents two philosophers from holding the *exact same object instance* of a chopstick because grabbing consumes it.\n    *   The main properties to check are typically related to deadlock (e.g., all philosophers hold one chopstick and wait indefinitely) or starvation. The commented-out `DINING-CHECK` module and `search` command provide an example of how you might define and search for a deadlock state.\n\nThis Maude code should provide a solid foundation for your formal analysis of the Dining Philosophers protocol. You can load it into Maude and use its execution and search capabilities."]], "MAUDE-1/diophantine.maude": [[true, "load LA.maude\n\nmod LINEAR-SYSTEM-SOLVER-EXAMPLES is\n  protecting LA .\n\n  -- First Example: Domenjoud's 10 Solution System (as per provided coefficients)\n  -- Matrix A entries:\n  -- (0,0) |-> 1 ; (0,1) |-> 2 ; (0,2) |-> -3 ; (0,3) |-> -2 ; (0,4) |-> -4 ;\n  -- (1,0) |-> 2 ; (1,1) |-> -1 ; (1,2) |-> -3 ; (1,3) |-> 2 ; (1,4) |-> 5\n  -- This matrix has 2 rows (indexed 0-1) and 5 columns (indexed 0-4).\n\n  op mesDomenjoud : -> MatrixEntrySet .\n  eq mesDomenjoud =\n    (0,0) |-> 1 ; (0,1) |-> 2 ; (0,2) |-> -3 ; (0,3) |-> -2 ; (0,4) |-> -4 ;\n    (1,0) |-> 2 ; (1,1) |-> -1 ; (1,2) |-> -3 ; (1,3) |-> 2 ; (1,4) |-> 5 .\n\n  op matrixDomenjoud : -> Matrix .\n  eq matrixDomenjoud = matrix(mesDomenjoud, 2, 5) .\n\n  -- The \"zero vector\" b for Domenjoud's system.

This corresponds to Maude's `MatrixEntrySet` representation.\n2.  **Zero Vector**: This term refers to the vector `b` in the system `Ax = b`. If it's a \"zero vector,\" it means `b` has all components equal to zero, so we are solving homogeneous systems `Ax = 0`.

Valid method strings include `\"cd\"` (for the Contejean-Devie algorithm) and `\"enum\"` (for an enumeration-based method).

The `eq` statement defines its value using the `(row, col) |-> value` notation.\n    *   **`op matrixDomenjoud : -> Matrix .`**: Declares an operator for the matrix itself. The `eq` statement constructs it using `matrix(entrySet, numRows, numCols)`.\n    *   **`op bDomenjoud : -> Vector .`**: Declares an operator for the right-hand side vector `b`. The `eq` statement defines it as a zero vector of appropriate dimension using `vector(empty, dimension)`. `empty` signifies no non-zero entries.\n    *   Similar definitions (`mesSailors`, `matrixSailors`, `bSailors`) are provided for the second example system.\n3.  **`reduce` commands**: These commands execute the `natSystemSolve` function for each system and method.\n    *   `natSystemSolve(A, b, \"cd\")` will use the Contejean-Devie algorithm.\n    *   `natSystemSolve(A, b, \"enum\")` will use an enumeration-based algorithm (which can be slower for complex systems but is an alternative).\n    *   The output will be a `SolutionSet`. If there are non-trivial non-negative integer solutions, it will be a set of basis vectors. If the only non-negative integer solution is the zero vector, `natSystemSolve` typically returns `emptySolutionSet`.\n\n**To use this code:**\n\n1.  Save it as a `.maude` file (e.g., `linear_systems.maude`).\n2.  Run Maude (or Maude-NPA, as it includes Maude).\n3.  Load the file: `in linear_systems.maude` or `load linear_systems.maude`.\n    Maude will process the definitions and then execute the `reduce` commands, printing the results (the solution sets).\n\nThis Maude code directly implements the protocol based on the interpretation of its components using standard features of Maude's Linear Algebra module. The \"gcd\" method string you mentioned isn't standard; if you have a custom Maude version or `LA.maude` extension that includes it, you can replace `\"cd\"` or `\"enum\"` with `\"gcd\"` in the `reduce` commands."]], "MAUDE-1/doubleAttributeFebruary2023.maude": [[true, "fmod FOO is\n  sort Foo .\n  op f : Foo -> Foo [iter iter] .\nendfm\n\nfmod FOO-ANALYSIS is\n  pr CIPC-SEMANTICS . -- Provides core Maude-NPA types (Sys, IK, Msg)\n                      -- and functions (iknows, \\in, emptyFactSet, etc.)\n  pr FOO .            -- Includes the user's definition of sort Foo and op f\n\n  -- Declare a constant of sort Foo.

For example, it would ensure that `X$Foo` is treated as a subsort of `X$Elt` only within the context of a specific instantiation of the parameter `X`.\n\nAs your description mentions, you can use the `show all .` command in an interactive Maude session after loading these modules to inspect the defined sorts and their relationships.

Based on your description, the goal is to observe Maude's behavior with parameterized sorts and views, particularly concerning how kinds are reported for potentially ambiguous or complex instantiations. The Maude-NPA environment uses Maude as its underlying engine, so the Maude code you've outlined is indeed what you would load and run.\n\nThe \"formal analysis\" in this specific context refers to setting up the Maude environment with these module definitions and then using Maude's introspection capabilities (like `show kinds .`) to observe the results, rather than performing a typical Maude-NPA reachability analysis for security properties.\n\nHere is the Maude code, ready to be compiled/loaded by Maude (and thus by Maude-NPA):\n\n```maude\nset show advisories off .\n\nfmod FOO{X :: STRICT-WEAK-ORDER} is\n  protecting LIST{Set{STRICT-WEAK-ORDER}{X}} .\n  op a : -> NeList{Set{STRICT-WEAK-ORDER}{X}} .\nendfm\n\nshow kinds .\n\nfmod BAR is\n  protecting LIST{Set{STRICT-WEAK-ORDER}{STRICT-TOTAL-ORDER}{Int<}} .\n  op a : -> NeList{Set{STRICT-WEAK-ORDER}{STRICT-TOTAL-ORDER}{Int<}} .\nendfm\n\nshow kinds .\n```\n**Explanation for Maude-NPA Context:**\n\n1.  **`set show advisories off .`**: This is a Maude system command to suppress advisory messages, often used to get cleaner output. It's perfectly valid in a Maude input file.\n2.  **`fmod FOO{X :: STRICT-WEAK-ORDER} is ... endfm`**: This defines your parameterized module `FOO`. The critical part here is `LIST{Set{STRICT-WEAK-ORDER}{X}}`, which uses the parameter `X` in the instantiation of the list's element type. Maude's default view mechanism will be invoked to make `Set{STRICT-WEAK-ORDER}{X}` (which denotes a sort type) fit the `TRIV` theory requirement of `LIST`.\n3.  **`show kinds .` (after FOO)**: This Maude command will display the kinds of all sorts known to Maude after `FOO` is defined. This output is crucial for your investigation into how Maude handles the sorts related to `FOO`.\n4.  **`fmod BAR is ... endfm`**: This defines your module `BAR`. The key part is `LIST{Set{STRICT-WEAK-ORDER}{STRICT-TOTAL-ORDER}{Int<}}`. This complex-looking sort type expression `Set{STRICT-WEAK-ORDER}{STRICT-TOTAL-ORDER}{Int<}}` is likely the core of your test, aiming to see how Maude parses and interprets it, especially in comparison to the parameterized version in `FOO`. `Int<` is a standard Maude view for integers with the less-than order.\n5.  **`show kinds .` (after BAR)**: This command will again display the kinds. By comparing this output with the previous `show kinds .` output, you can observe the differences (if any) in how Maude represents the list sorts, which is the purpose of your described protocol/test.\n\nTo use this with Maude-NPA:\n*   Save the code above into a file (e.g., `view_test.maude`).\n*   Run Maude-NPA and load this file: `maude view_test.maude` (or if Maude-NPA has a specific load command within its environment, use that).\n*   The `show kinds .` commands will execute as Maude processes the file, and their output will be printed to the console. This output constitutes the \"result\" of your current analysis.\n\nThis setup directly addresses your aim to \"test and illustrate a specific bug related to the internal naming conventions of multiply instantiated views\" by defining the relevant modules and then querying Maude's type system."]], "MAUDE-1/instantiationJuly2019.maude": [[true, "set show timing off .\nset show advisories off .\n\nfth FOO is\n  sort Small .\n  op a : -> Small .\nendfth\n\nfmod BAR{X :: FOO} is\n  sort Big .\n  subsort X$Small < Big .\n  op f : Big -> Bool .\n  eq f(X$a) = true .\nendfm\n\nfmod BAZ is\n  sort Baz .\n  op b : -> Baz .\nendfm\n\nview V from FOO to BAZ is\n  sort Small to Baz .\n  op a to b .\nendv\n\nfmod TEST is\n  inc BAR{V} .\nendfm\n\nred b .", "```maude\nset show timing off .\nset show advisories off .\n\nfth FOO is\n  sort Small .\n  op a : -> Small .\nendfth\n\nfmod BAR{X :: FOO} is\n  sort Big .\n  subsort X$Small < Big .\n  op f : Big -> Bool .\n  eq f(X$a) = true .\nendfm\n\nfmod BAZ is\n  sort Baz .\n  op b : -> Baz .\nendfm\n\nview V from FOO to BAZ is\n  sort Small to Baz .\n  op a to b .\nendv\n\nfmod TEST is\n  inc BAR{V} .\nendfm\n\nred b .\n```"]], "MAUDE-1/initialEqualityPredicate.maude": [[true, "set show timing off .\nset show advisories off .\n\nfmod PROTOCOL is\n  --- Maude-NPA requires a top sort Msg for messages.\n  sort Msg .\n  sorts Nat String Foo .\n  subsort Nat < Msg .\n  subsort String < Msg .\n  subsort Foo < Msg .\n\n  --- Operators for Nat and String (from Module DECOMPOSE description)\n  op 0 : -> Nat [ctor] .\n  ops f g : Nat Nat -> Nat .\n  ops h i : Nat Nat -> String .\n  op c : Nat Nat -> Nat [comm] .\n  op b : Nat Nat -> Nat [assoc comm id: 0] .\n  op s : Nat -> Nat [iter] . --- Iterative operator for Nat\n\n  --- Operators for Foo (from Module FOO description)\n  op 1 : -> Foo [ctor] . --- Identity for f : Foo Foo -> Foo\n  ops constA constB constC : -> Foo [ctor] . --- Constants used in an equation\n\n  op __ : Foo Foo -> Foo [assoc prec 50 gather (e E)] . --- Associative juxtaposition for Foo\n  op _+_ : Foo Foo -> Foo [assoc comm prec 52 gather (E e)] . --- Associative-commutative sum for Foo\n  op s : Foo Foo -> Foo [comm prec 51 gather (E e)] . --- Commutative operator s for Foo (overloads s : Nat -> Nat)\n  op f : Foo Foo -> Foo [assoc comm id: 1 prec 51 gather (E e)] . --- ACUI operator f for Foo (overloads f : Nat Nat -> Nat)\n  ops g h p : Foo -> Foo [prec 40] . --- Unary operators for Foo (overloads g, h for Nat/String)\n\n  --- Variables\n  vars N N1 N2 N3 N4 : Nat . --- Generic variables for Nat\n  vars F F1 F2 F3 F4 F5 F6 F7 : Foo . --- Generic variables for Foo\n\n  --- Equations\n\n  --- Equation from p's definition in FOO module\n  eq p(F) = g(h(F)) .\n\n  --- Equations derived from \"reduction rules\" in DECOMPOSE module (Nat/String related)\n  --- Note: \"red X .=.

The \"associativity\" in this context likely refers to how sequences of elements form these structures, which is implicitly handled by the parser and the available constructors.\n    *   `rev` is defined with basic equations for list reversal.\n    *   Variables `A, B, C, X, Y, Z, P, Q, R, E, F, G, S, T, U, V` are declared as specified.\n\n2.  **`UNIFICATION-PROTOCOL` Module:**\n    *   Includes `ASSOC-LIST` and Maude-NPA's `PROTOCOL`.\n    *   Makes `Elt`, `Pair`, `Triple`, `List` subsorts of `Msg` so they can be used in protocol states.\n    *   Defines constant elements `e1, e2, e3`.\n    *   Declares variables `S, T, A, B` as per your description, so you can refer to them in search commands if needed (e.g., `search ... such that S := TR ...`).\n    *   `testSpecificList` provides the concrete list term `e1 e2 e3` for the test.\n    *   The rule `irredundant-unification-test-rule` is designed to test the unification:\n        *   It starts from a state `initialTestState(Lskilled)`.\n        *   The condition `TR == Lskilled` attempts to unify a fresh `Triple` variable `TR` with the `List` term `Lskilled`.\n        *   If unification succeeds, the state transitions to `unificationResultState(TR)`, where `TR` is instantiated to the unified term.\n\n3.  **Testing Unification (Example Maude-NPA Commands):**\n\n    To run the test and observe the unifiers, you would load this file into Maude-NPA and use a search command.\n\n    *   **Initial State:** You need to define an initial state for the search. In Maude, you can do this with an `op initial : -> Sys .` or directly in the search command. Let's assume you define an initial state:\n        ```maude\n        op initial : -> Sys .\n        eq initial = { initialTestState(testSpecificList) } .\n        ```\n        (You'd add this within the `UNIFICATION-PROTOCOL` module or in a separate module that imports it.)\n\n    *   **Search Command:**\n        ```maude-npa\n        search initial =>! X:Sys .\n        ```\n        Or, more specifically focusing on the result:\n        ```maude-npa\n        search { initialTestState(testSpecificList) } =>! { unificationResultState(TR) } .\n        ```\n        This search will find all states reachable in one step. The variable `TR` (bound by the search pattern `unificationResultState(TR)`) will show the different `Triple` instances that Maude-NPA found as unifiers for `testSpecificList`. You should expect to see two distinct solutions for `TR`:\n        1.  `(e1 e2) e3`\n        2.  `e1 (e2 e3)`\n\n        If the bug you described (\"loss of irredundant unifiers\") were present and affected this case, you might only see one of these solutions. The purpose of `irred unify` in your description is inherently what Maude-NPA's unification (`==?`) aims to achieve.\n\nThis setup provides the formal code to investigate the unification behavior you're interested in. The terms `S`, `T`, `A`, `B` from your description are available as Maude variables for you to use in more complex queries if needed, but the core test for irredundant unifiers of a `Triple` variable with the list `e1 e2 e3` is captured by the rule and the suggested search."]], "MAUDE-1/kindNameDecember2022.maude": [[true, "set show advisories off .\n\n*** Test for bug where kinds were printed incorrectly from premodules. ***\n\nfmod FOO{X :: TRIV} is\n  sorts S{X} T{X} .\n  subsort X$Elt < S{X} T{X} .\n  op f : [S{X},T{X}] -> [S{X},T{X}] .\nendfm\n\nshow mod .", "Okay, I can help you generate the Maude code for the `FOO` module as described.

The Maude syntax `subsort X$Elt < S{X} T{X} .` means that `X$Elt` is a subsort of `S{X}`, and `X$Elt` is also a subsort of `T{X}`.

This means `X` provides a sort, denoted `X$Elt` within the module.\n4.  **`sorts S{X} T{X} .`**: This declares two new sorts, `S{X}` and `T{X}`. These are parameterized sorts, dependent on the module parameter `X`.\n5.  **`subsort X$Elt < S{X} T{X} .`**: This establishes subsort relationships.\n    *   It declares that `X$Elt` (the sort of elements provided by the parameter `X`) is a subsort of `S{X}`.\n    *   It also declares that `X$Elt` is a subsort of `T{X}`.\n    *   This means any term of sort `X$Elt` can be used where a term of sort `S{X}` or `T{X}` is expected.\n6.  **`op f : [S{X},T{X}] -> [S{X},T{X}] .`**: This defines an operation `f`.\n    *   It takes two arguments, the first of sort `S{X}` and the second of sort `T{X}`. These are grouped as a pair using the `[_,_]` notation for product sorts.\n    *   It returns a pair of values, the first of sort `S{X}` and the second of sort `T{X}`.\n7.  **`show mod .`**: This Maude command will display the full definition of the module `FOO` after it has been processed by Maude. This is crucial for your stated purpose of testing the \"correct printing of kinds from premodules,\" as the output of `show mod .` would reveal how Maude interprets and represents these kinds.\n\nThis Maude code can be loaded and processed by Maude, and therefore by Maude-NPA.

The primary one is Bob authenticating Alice.\n\nendm)\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Maude-NPA Code:**\n\n1.  **`NSLDB-COMMON` Module:**\n    *   Defines basic sorts: `PId` (Principal ID: a, b, i for Alice, Bob, Intruder), `Key`, `Nonce`, `Fresh` (for generating nonces), `Msg`.\n    *   Defines cryptographic operations:\n        *   `pk(P)`: Public key of P.\n        *   `sk(P)`: Private key of P.\n        *   `inv(K)`: Inverse of key K (if K is public, inv(K) is private, and vice-versa).\n        *   `enc(M, K)`: Encryption of message M with key K.\n        *   `dec(M, K)`: Decryption.\n        *   `_._`: Message concatenation.\n        *   `n(P, F)`: Nonce generated by principal P using fresh value F.\n    *   Equations define how decryption undoes encryption and the relationship between public and private keys.\n\n2.  **`NSLDB-PROTOCOL` Module:**\n    *   **Strands:**\n        *   `alice(A B : PId)(Na Nb : Fresh)`: Alice's role.\n            1.  `+ enc(n(A,Na) . A, pk(B))`: Alice sends her nonce `Na` and her identity `A`, encrypted with Bob's public key `pk(B)`.\n            2.  `- enc(n(A,Na) . n(B,Nb) . B, pk(A))`: Alice receives her nonce `Na` back (confirming Bob decrypted her first message), Bob's challenge nonce `Nb`, and Bob's identity `B`, all encrypted with her public key `pk(A)`.\n            3.  `+ enc(n(B,Nb) . A, pk(B))`: Alice sends Bob's nonce `Nb` back and her identity `A`, encrypted with Bob's public key `pk(B)`.\n        *   `bob(A B : PId)(Na Nb : Fresh)`: Bob's role (symmetric to Alice's).\n            1.  `- enc(n(A,Na) . A, pk(B))`: Bob receives message 1.\n            2.  `+ enc(n(A,Na) . n(B,Nb) . B, pk(A))`: Bob sends message 2.\n            3.  `- enc(n(B,Nb) . A, pk(B))`: Bob receives message 3.\n    *   **`iknows` statements:** Define the intruder's initial knowledge. The intruder knows all public keys, its own private key (`sk(i)`), and the identities of `a`, `b`, `i`.\n    *   **`non-orig` statements:** Declare which nonces are freshly generated within a strand. `n(A,Na)` is fresh for Alice's strand, and `n(B,Nb)` is fresh for Bob's strand. This is crucial for preventing replay of old nonces as new ones.\n    *   **`facts (non-orig sk(a))` and `(non-orig sk(b))`**: Asserts that the private keys of honest principals are not initially known by the intruder.\n    *   **`uniq-orig` statements:** Ensure that each fresh nonce is generated only once across all protocol runs.\n\n3.  **`NSLDB-INITIAL-STATE` Module:**\n    *   Defines a specific initial configuration for analysis. Here, Alice (`a`) initiates with Bob (`b`) using fresh nonces `Na` and `Nb`. A corresponding Bob strand is also included.\n    *   `knowledge (empty)`: The intruder starts with no additional knowledge beyond what's defined in `iknows`.\n\n4.  **`NSLDB-ATTACK-STATE` Module:**\n    *   **`critical (iknows (n a Na)) ...` and `critical (iknows (n b Nb)) ...`**: These are secrecy goals. They check if the intruder can learn Alice's nonce `Na` or Bob's nonce `Nb`. For this protocol, `Na` is sent to Bob, and `Nb` is sent to Alice, so they are not secret from their intended recipients, but should be secret from the intruder.\n    *   **`pattern (bob(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 3) and not (alice(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 3) [attack]`**: This is a classic authentication attack pattern.\n        *   `bob(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 3`: Bob (principal `B` in this specific strand instance, but playing the \"Bob\" role) believes he has successfully completed the protocol with principal `A` (playing the \"Alice\" role), using nonces `Na` (from `A`) and `Nb` (his own challenge).\n        *   `not (alice(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 3)`: Principal `A` (playing \"Alice\") has *not* completed her strand with `B` using the same nonces `Na` and `Nb`.\n        *   If Maude-NPA finds a state satisfying this pattern, it means Bob was potentially duped. He thinks he's talking to Alice, but Alice isn't (or wasn't recently) engaged in this specific session with him. This is a strong indication of an authentication flaw or impersonation.\n    *   The second authentication attack pattern `(alice(A, B, Na, Nb) @ 2) and not (bob(B, A, Na, Nb) @ 2) [attack]` is for Alice authenticating Bob. It checks if Alice reaches step 2 (after receiving msg2 with `Na` and `Nb`), believing it's from `B`, but `B` never actually sent msg2 to `A` with those specific nonces. (I've kept the `A,B` in `bob` consistent with `alice` for clarity in variable mapping, even if `A` plays Bob's role and `B` plays Alice's role in that strand). The first attack state on Bob authenticating Alice is typically the primary concern for this type of protocol.\n\nTo analyze this protocol, you would typically run Maude-NPA with commands like:\n`search initial-state =>! ATTACK .` (to find any attack state)\nor specific searches for secrecy or the defined authentication attacks.\n\nThis Maude-NPA code provides a solid basis for formally analyzing the security properties of the described NSL-Distance Bounding protocol."]], "MAUDE-1/legacyMetaGetVariant.maude": [[true, "fmod XOR is\n  sort Elem .\n  sort XOR < Elem .\n\n  -- Constants cst1, cst2, cst3, cst4:\n  -- The description states they are of sort Elem.\n  -- However, they are used in terms like X:XOR + cst1.\n  -- Given that _+_ is defined as an operation on XOR (XOR XOR -> XOR),\n  -- for these terms to be well-typed, cst1-cst4 must be of sort XOR.\n  -- Since XOR is a subsort of Elem, declaring them as XOR is consistent\n  -- with them also being Elem elements.\n  op cst1 : -> XOR .\n  op cst2 : -> XOR .\n  op cst3 : -> XOR .\n  op cst4 : -> XOR .\n\n  -- Operations for the XOR algebra\n  op _+_ : XOR XOR -> XOR [assoc comm] .  -- Associative and commutative XOR operation\n  op 0 : -> XOR .                          -- Identity element for XOR\n  op a : -> XOR .                          -- Another constant element in XOR\n\n  -- Variables for equations\n  vars X Y : XOR .\n\n  -- Equations defining the XOR properties\n  eq Y + 0 = Y .            -- Identity property\n  eq X + X = 0 .            -- Self-inverse property (XORing with self gives identity)\n  eq X + X + Y = Y .        -- Derived property (from X + X = 0 and Y + 0 = Y)\nendfm\n\nmod TEST is\n  inc XOR .         -- Include the XOR algebra module\n  inc META-LEVEL .  -- Include META-LEVEL for meta-programming functions\nendm\n\n-- Reduction commands using metaGetVariant\n-- These commands will explore variants of terms under the XOR theory.\n-- X:XOR is the variable with respect to which variants are sought.\n\nred metaGetVariant(X:XOR + cst1, X:XOR) .\nred metaGetVariant(X:XOR + cst2, X:XOR) .", "```maude\nfmod XOR is\n  sort Elem .\n  sort XOR < Elem .\n\n  -- Constants cst1, cst2, cst3, cst4:\n  -- The description states they are of sort Elem.\n  -- However, they are used in terms like X:XOR + cst1.\n  -- Given that _+_ is defined as an operation on XOR (XOR XOR -> XOR),\n  -- for these terms to be well-typed, cst1-cst4 must be of sort XOR.\n  -- Since XOR is a subsort of Elem, declaring them as XOR is consistent\n  -- with them also being Elem elements.\n  op cst1 : -> XOR .\n  op cst2 : -> XOR .\n  op cst3 : -> XOR .\n  op cst4 : -> XOR .\n\n  -- Operations for the XOR algebra\n  op _+_ : XOR XOR -> XOR [assoc comm] .  -- Associative and commutative XOR operation\n  op 0 : -> XOR .                          -- Identity element for XOR\n  op a : -> XOR .                          -- Another constant element in XOR\n\n  -- Variables for equations\n  vars X Y : XOR .\n\n  -- Equations defining the XOR properties\n  eq Y + 0 = Y .            -- Identity property\n  eq X + X = 0 .            -- Self-inverse property (XORing with self gives identity)\n  eq X + X + Y = Y .        -- Derived property (from X + X = 0 and Y + 0 = Y)\nendfm\n\nmod TEST is\n  inc XOR .         -- Include the XOR algebra module\n  inc META-LEVEL .  -- Include META-LEVEL for meta-programming functions\nendm\n\n-- Reduction commands using metaGetVariant\n-- These commands will explore variants of terms under the XOR theory.\n-- X:XOR is the variable with respect to which variants are sought.\n\nred metaGetVariant(X:XOR + cst1, X:XOR) .\nred metaGetVariant(X:XOR + cst2, X:XOR) .\n```"]], "MAUDE-1/mapToParameterTheory.maude": [[true, "set show timing off .\nset include BOOL off .\n\n-- Output will be displayed for each TEST_ module if Maude is run with this file.\n-- To avoid excessive output, one might comment out most \"show module\" commands\n-- or use \"show module TEST_XYZ .\" selectively.\n\n**************************************\n*** 1. explicit-explicit sort mapping ***\n**************************************\n-- Description: A sort from a theory is explicitly mapped to a sort in a \n-- parameterized module using a view.

Based on your description, here's the Maude module that defines the sorts, operations, equations, and rewrite rules.\n\nThis Maude module is structured for use with Maude-NPA, assuming a `MESSAGE` module that provides the basic `Msg` sort.\n\nHere are a few notes on the interpretation:\n\n1.  **Sorts and Subsorts**: `Foo` is a subsort of `Bar`. For Maude-NPA, these would typically be subsorts of `Msg`. So, `Foo < Bar < Msg`.\n2.  **Constant `a`**: The description states `a` is of sort `Bar`. However, it's later used in `f(a,b)`, where `f` expects arguments of sort `Foo`. The meta-level representation `'f['a.Foo, 'b.Foo]` also suggests `a` is treated as `Foo`. To reconcile this and ensure type correctness, `a` is declared as `op a : -> Foo .`. Since `Foo` is a subsort of `Bar`, `a` is then also an element of `Bar`, satisfying that part of the description.\n3.  **Meta-Level Behavior**: The \"Meta-Apply\" and \"Meta-Xapply\" sections describe how Maude's built-in meta-level functions (`metaApply`, `metaXapply`) can interact with the protocol's rules. The key part for the Maude code is that the rewrite rule for `f` should be labeled `k`, as specified in your description (\"The application is labeled with `k`\"). The provided `metaApply` and `metaXapply` calls are examples of external Maude commands, not operations defined within this module.\n4.  **Module Name**: I've named the module `SIMPLE-ALGEBRAIC-PROTOCOL-ALG`.\n\n```maude\nfmod SIMPLE-ALGEBRAIC-PROTOCOL-ALG is\n  pr(MESSAGE) . --- Assuming MESSAGE module from Maude-NPA providing Msg sort\n\n  --- Sorts\n  sorts Foo Bar .\n  subsort Foo < Bar < Msg . --- Foo is a subsort of Bar, Bar is a subsort of Msg\n\n  --- Operations\n  --- Constants:\n  op a : -> Foo . --- Declared as Foo to be usable in f(a,b); also a Bar due to subsorting.\n  op c : -> Bar .\n  \n  --- Function (constant of sort Foo):\n  op b : -> Foo .\n  \n  --- Binary Operation:\n  op f : Foo Foo -> Foo [comm] . --- Commutative binary operation\n\n  --- Variables for rules and equations\n  var X Y : Foo .\n\n  --- Equations\n  eq a = c . --- a and c are considered equivalent\n\n  --- Rewrite Rules\n  rl [k] : f(X, Y) => X . --- Rule labeled 'k' as per meta-level description\n\nendfm\n```\n\n**Explanation of the Maude code:**\n\n*   `fmod SIMPLE-ALGEBRAIC-PROTOCOL-ALG is ... endfm`: Defines a functional module for the protocol's algebra.\n*   `pr(MESSAGE) .`: Includes the `MESSAGE` module, which is standard in Maude-NPA for providing the `Msg` sort and basic message operations.\n*   `sorts Foo Bar .`: Declares the two sorts.\n*   `subsort Foo < Bar < Msg .`: Defines `Foo` as a subsort of `Bar`, and `Bar` as a subsort of `Msg`. This means any term of sort `Foo` is also of sort `Bar`, and any term of sort `Bar` is also of sort `Msg`.\n*   `op a : -> Foo .`: Declares `a` as a constant of sort `Foo`. As `Foo` is a subsort of `Bar`, `a` is also implicitly a `Bar`. This resolves the typing for `f(a,b)`.\n*   `op c : -> Bar .`: Declares `c` as a constant of sort `Bar`.\n*   `op b : -> Foo .`: Declares `b` as a constant of sort `Foo`.\n*   `op f : Foo Foo -> Foo [comm] .`: Declares `f` as a binary operator taking two `Foo` arguments, returning a `Foo`, and having the `comm` (commutative) attribute.\n*   `var X Y : Foo .`: Declares variables `X` and `Y` of sort `Foo`, used in the rewrite rule.\n*   `eq a = c .`: Defines the equation stating that `a` and `c` are equal. Maude will use this to normalize terms.\n*   `rl [k] : f(X, Y) => X .`: Defines the rewrite rule. When `f` is applied to two `Foo` terms, it rewrites to the first term. The rule is labeled `k`, which is relevant for the meta-level operations you described.\n\nThis module should be compilable by Maude and usable within the Maude-NPA framework for formal analysis. The \"Meta-Apply\" and \"Meta-Xapply\" parts of your description are external ways to use Maude's reflection capabilities on this algebra, specifically by referring to the rule labeled `k`."]],

The commutativity of `_*_` ensures `g^(N1*N2) = g^(N2*N1)`.\n*   **`PROTOCOL-SPECIFICATION`**:\n    *   `define_role A_role` and `define_role B_role` specify the sequence of messages sent and received by participants A and B.\n        *   `fresh (N : Nonce)` declares a nonce `N` that is freshly generated for that role instance.\n        *   `vars (N : Nonce)` declares a nonce `N` that is learned from a received message.\n        *   The `send` and `recv` constructs define the messages. The patterns in `recv` implicitly perform signature verification: for a message `sign(M, sk(P))` to be matched, the sender must have used `sk(P)`.\n    *   `define_initial_state` sets up the initial knowledge of all parties, including the intruder. Public keys of honest participants are typically known.\n    *   `define_attack_state IntruderKnowsSecret (NAA NBB : Nonce)` defines what constitutes an attack: the intruder learns the shared secret `exp(exp(g, NBB), NAA)`. The variables `NAA` and `NBB` would be instantiated by Maude-NPA during its search. The actual analysis commands would then be used to check if these nonces indeed originate from an honest execution between A and B.\n\nThis code should provide a solid basis for analyzing your protocol with Maude-NPA. Remember to use the appropriate Maude-NPA executive commands to perform the actual security analysis (e.g., for secrecy)."]], "MAUDE-1/orphanedViewInstantiationFebruary2023.maude": [[true, "*** Test that orphaned view instantiation is garbage collected. ***\n\nfmod FOO is\n  inc LIST{Set{Nat}} .\nendfm\n\nshow modules .\nshow views .", "```maude\n*** Test that orphaned view instantiation is garbage collected. ***\n\nfmod FOO is\n  inc LIST{Set{Nat}} .\nendfm\n\nshow modules .\nshow views .\n```"]], "MAUDE-1/parallel-maude-npa.maude": [[true, "fmod PARALLEL-META-INTERPRETER-MANAGER is\n  pr LIST{Qid} .\n  pr SET{Qid} .\n  pr MAP{Qid, QidList} .\n  pr MAP{Qid, Qid} .\n  pr NAT .\n\n  -- Sorts for entities and their components\n  sorts Id MsgContent AgentState WorkerState ProtocolMsg .\n  subsort Qid < Id .\n  subsort ProtocolMsg < Msg .\n\n  -- Identifiers for manager and workers\n  op mngrId : -> Qid .\n  op workerId : Nat -> Qid . -- e.g., workerId(1), workerId(2)\n\n  -- Manager States\n  ops initMgr creatingWorkers loadingModules working terminating cleanup halted : -> AgentState .\n\n  -- Worker States\n  ops idleWrk loadingWrk loadedWrk processingWrk stoppedWrk : -> WorkerState .\n\n  -- Manager entity\n  -- mgr(ManagerID, State, TotalWorkers, CreatedWorkerCount, LoadedWorkersSet, StoppedWorkersSet,\n  --     Modules, Grammars, Filters, JobQueue, ActiveJobsMap[WorkerId -> JobId])\n  op mgr : Qid AgentState Nat Nat Set{Qid} Set{Qid} QidList QidList QidList QidList Map{Qid,Qid} -> Strand .\n\n  -- Worker entity\n  -- wrk(WorkerID, State, CurrentJob, LoadedModulesList)\n  op wrk : Qid WorkerState Qid QidList -> Strand .\n  op noJob : -> Qid . -- Placeholder for no current job\n\n  -- Message Contents\n  -- For manager initialization by an external entity (e.g., user)\n  op setupManager : Qid Nat QidList QidList QidList QidList -> MsgContent .\n    -- managerId, numWorkers, modules, grammars, filters, initialJobs\n\n  op createAndLoadWorkerOrder : Qid QidList -> MsgContent . -- workerId, modulesToLoad\n  op modulesLoadedAck : Qid -> MsgContent . -- workerId\n\n  op assignJobOrder : Qid Qid -> MsgContent . -- workerId, jobId\n  op jobCompletedAck : Qid Qid -> MsgContent . -- workerId, jobId (result is abstracted)\n\n  op quitOrder : Qid -> MsgContent . -- workerId\n  op workerStoppedAck : Qid -> MsgContent . -- workerId\n\n  -- Protocol Message constructor\n  op msg : MsgContent Qid Qid -> ProtocolMsg . -- content, sender, receiver\n\n  vars M W MID WID JOB JID : Qid .\n  vars N K : Nat .\n  vars MQ ML GL FL LMODS : QidList .\n  vars SLW SSW : Set{Qid} .\n  vars AJM : Map{Qid,Qid} .\n  vars MSt : AgentState .\n  vars WSt : WorkerState .\n\n  -- RULES --\n\n  -- 1.

Workers transition from `processingWrk` back to `loadedWrk` upon completing a job. The content/result of the job is not explicitly modeled beyond its ID.\n2.  **Sorts and Operators:**\n    *   `Id`: Generic identifiers (using Maude's built-in `Qid` - quoted identifiers).\n    *   `AgentState`, `WorkerState`: Enumerate the states for manager and workers.\n    *   `mgr`, `wrk`: Constructors for manager and worker strands (state representations).\n    *   `MsgContent`: Defines the types of information exchanged.\n    *   `ProtocolMsg`: The actual message structure `msg(Content, Sender, Receiver)`.\n    *   `QidList`, `Set{Qid}`, `Map{Qid,Qid}`: Used for lists of modules/jobs, sets of worker IDs, and mapping workers to jobs.\n3.  **Manager State (`mgr`):**\n    *   `ManagerID`: Its unique ID.\n    *   `State`: Current operational state.\n    *   `TotalWorkers`: The target number of workers (`N`).\n    *   `CreatedWorkerCount`: A counter for how many workers have been initiated (`K`).\n    *   `LoadedWorkersSet`: IDs of workers that have confirmed module loading.\n    *   `StoppedWorkersSet`: IDs of workers that have confirmed shutdown.\n    *   `Modules`, `Grammars`, `Filters`: Lists of configurations (represented as `QidList`).\n    *   `JobQueue`: A list of `IdSystem`s (represented as `QidList` of job IDs).\n    *   `ActiveJobsMap`: Maps an active `WorkerId` to its current `JobId`.\n4.  **Worker State (`wrk`):**\n    *   `WorkerID`: Its unique ID.\n    *   `State`: Current operational state.\n    *   `CurrentJob`: ID of the job it's processing (or `noJob`).\n    *   `LoadedModulesList`: Modules it has \"loaded\".\n5.  **Rules:**\n    *   Each rule describes a state transition for the manager or a worker, often triggered by receiving a message or an internal condition.\n    *   **Worker Creation:** The manager iteratively creates workers (`K < N`) and tells them to load modules. Once `K == N`, it transitions to `loadingModules` state to wait for acknowledgments.\n    *   **Module Loading:** Workers receive the load order, change state, and ack. The manager collects these acks.\n    *   **Job Assignment:** The manager picks a job from its queue and an idle, loaded worker, then sends an assignment.\n    *   **Termination:** When the job queue is empty and no jobs are active, the manager starts terminating workers.\n    *   **Cleanup & Halted:** Final states after all workers are stopped.\n6.  **IDs:** `mngrId` is a constant. `workerId(K)` generates unique worker IDs based on a natural number. Job IDs, module names, etc., are represented as `Qid`s.\n7.  **NPA Context:** In a typical Maude-NPA setup, you'd define initial states (e.g., a `setupManager` message being sent) and potentially attack states to check for vulnerabilities. This model focuses on the protocol logic itself.\n8.  **Concurrency:** The rules can fire concurrently if their conditions are met. For example, multiple workers can be processing jobs simultaneously, or the manager can be assigning a job while another worker sends a `jobCompletedAck`.\n9.  **Message Handling:** Rules for sending messages add a `msg(...)` term to the state. Rules for receiving messages consume a `msg(...)` term.\n10. **Simplifications:**\n    *   \"Round-robin or parallel distribution strategy\": Simplified to assigning to any available worker.\n    *   \"Switching Phase\" and \"Resuming Phase\": Not explicitly modeled to keep the initial version focused on the core lifecycle. These could be added as further states and rules.\n    *   The actual content of jobs, modules, grammars, filters is abstract (just IDs).\n\nThis Maude code provides a formal model of the described protocol's control flow and message passing, suitable for analysis with Maude's tools (including potentially Maude-NPA if intruder models and attack states were added)."]], "MAUDE-1/parameterizedPolymorphicConstantMarch2023.maude": [[true, "(load maude-npa.maude) --- This command loads Maude-NPA.\n                        --- It assumes 'maude-npa.maude' is in Maude's load path\n                        --- or in the current directory.\n\n(omod PARAMETER-CHANGES-DEMO-SPEC is\n  inc MAUDE-NPA . --- Includes standard Maude-NPA sorts (e.g., Msg, State)\n                  --- and operations.

This is key for polymorphism, allowing terms of sort `Bool` to be used where `Poly` is expected.\n    *   `op f : Poly Poly -> Poly [assoc prec 0] .`: Declares the operator `f`.\n        *   It takes two arguments of sort `Poly` and returns a `Poly`.\n        *   `[assoc]` makes `f` associative, allowing Maude to parse flattened expressions like `f(t1, t2, t3)`.\n        *   `[prec 0]` sets its precedence (useful in more complex expressions, good practice).\n    *   `vars X Y Z : Bool .`: Declares `X`, `Y`, and `Z` as variables of sort `Bool`.\n\n2.  **`POLY-ITER` Module:**\n    *   `sort Poly .` and `subsort Bool < Poly .`: Same as above.\n    *   `op f : Poly -> Poly [iter prec 0] .`: Declares the operator `f`.\n        *   It takes one argument of sort `Poly` and returns a `Poly`.\n        *   `[iter]` allows the operator to be used with iterative syntax, e.g., `f^12345(term)`.\n        *   `[prec 0]` sets its precedence.\n    *   `var X : Bool .`: Declares `X` as a variable of sort `Bool`.\n\n**How to Test:**\n\n1.  Save the code above into a file, for example, `poly-tests.maude`.\n2.  Open Maude (or Maude-NPA, as it uses Maude's engine).\n3.  Load the file: `load poly-tests.maude` or `in poly-tests.maude`.\n4.  Run the reductions as specified in the comments:\n    *   For `POLY-ASSOC`: `red in POLY-ASSOC : f(X:Bool, Y:Bool, Z:Bool) .`\n        *   Maude should parse this and output a term like `f(X, f(Y, Z))` (the exact parenthesization may depend on internal defaults if no specific strategy like `left Elabel` or `right Elabel` is given with `strat`). The key is that it parses without error.\n    *   For `POLY-ITER`: `red in POLY-ITER : f^12345(X:Bool) .`\n        *   Maude should parse this and output the term `f^12345(X)`. The key is successful parsing.\n\nThis setup directly tests Maude's ability to parse polymorphic operators using flattened associative syntax and iterative syntax, which is the core purpose of your described protocol. The use of `Bool` as a subsort of `Poly` confirms the polymorphic aspect. If Maude processes these commands without errors, it means it correctly handles these syntactic features."]], "MAUDE-1/quotedTokenMarch2023.maude": [[true, "set show timing off .\n\n***\n***  Protocol FOO: Demonstrating operations on Natural Numbers\n***\n\nfmod FOO is\n  pr NAT .\n\n  op \"s\" : Nat -> Nat [iter] .\n  op \"f\"g : Nat -> Nat [iter] .\n\nendfm\n\n*** Reductions demonstrating evaluation\nred \"X\":Nat .\nred \"X:Y\":NzNat .\nred \"X:Y\"Z:NzNat .\nred \"X\":[Nat] .\n\n*** Examples of operations\nred \"s\"^42(0) .\nred \"f\"g^2(0) .", "Okay, I can help you generate the Maude formal analysis code for the FOO protocol based on your description.\n\nHere is the Maude code corresponding to the FOO protocol description you provided:\n\n```maude\nset show timing off .\n\n***\n***  Protocol FOO: Demonstrating operations on Natural Numbers\n***\n\nfmod FOO is\n  pr NAT .\n\n  op \"s\" : Nat -> Nat [iter] .\n  op \"f\"g : Nat -> Nat [iter] .\n\nendfm\n\n*** Reductions demonstrating evaluation\nred \"X\":Nat .\nred \"X:Y\":NzNat .\nred \"X:Y\"Z:NzNat .\nred \"X\":[Nat] .\n\n*** Examples of operations\nred \"s\"^42(0) .\nred \"f\"g^2(0) .\n```"]], "MAUDE-1/pseudoParameterTheoryConstantMarch2023.maude": [[true, "(fth T is\n  pr QID . --- Importing QID theory for the sort Qid.

The syntax `op c{X} : -> Elt .` in your description needs `X` to have a sort for Maude-NPA. A common choice for generic parameters is `Qid` (quoted identifier), which is available in Maude-NPA.\n\nThe module parameterization `fmod FOO{Xparam :: T}` means `Xparam` is a *module view*. If the equation `eq c{X} = c{X}` inside `FOO` refers to this module parameter `Xparam`, it implies `c` would take a module (or module identifier) as an argument. This is an advanced Maude feature and less typical for cryptographic operator modeling in Maude-NPA, where `c` would usually take terms like `Qid`s.\n\nBelow is the Maude-NPA code. It includes:\n1.

The description outlines two modules, both conceptually named `FOO`, with specific operations and equations. The core idea seems to be testing the behavior of a function `h` under conditions involving an \"alien\" constructor `i` and AC matching for `f`.\n\nHere's the Maude code.

Natural numbers are constructed using `0` and the successor function `s_`.\n\n2.  **Variables**: `N`, `N'`, `M` are natural number variables. `S` is a set variable.\n    *   `N` is used in the recursive definition of `g`.\n    *   `N'` is used in the pattern `s N'` within `h`'s equation. This pattern `s N'` matches any positive natural number (let's call it `N_desc` from your description), binding `N'` to `N_desc - 1`. This effectively implements the condition `N_desc > 0`.\n    *   `M` is used as the argument to the \"alien\" constructor `i`.\n\n3.  **Operations**:\n    *   `f : Set Set -> Set [assoc comm]` defines `f` as a binary operator on `Set` which is associative and commutative. Maude's AC matching will treat arguments to `f` as a multiset.\n    *   `g : Nat -> Set` is defined recursively:\n        *   `g(0) = 0`.\n        *   `g(s N) = f(g(N), s N)`. This means `g(k)` expands to a nested `f` structure involving `0, s 0, s s 0, ..., s^k 0`.\n    *   `i : Nat -> Set` is the \"alien\" constructor. The term `i(M)` is a non-ground alien term.\n    *   `h : Set -> Nat` is the function whose behavior is being tested. Its output is a natural number.\n\n4.  **Equations for `h`**:\n    *   In `FOO1`: `eq h(f(s N', S, i(M))) = 0 .`\n        This means if `h` is applied to a term `f(arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)` (where `f`'s arguments form a multiset), and this multiset contains:\n        1.  A positive natural number (matching `s N'`).\n        2.  An alien term (matching `i(M)`).\n        3.  Other terms (collected into `S` by the AC matcher).\n        Then the result is `0`.\n    *   In `FOO2`: `eq h(f(s N', S, i(M))) = M .`\n        The conditions for matching are the same, but the result is `M` (the natural number used in the `i(M)` term).\n\n5.  **Reductions**:\n    *   `red in FOO1 : h(g(s s s s s s s 0)) .` corresponds to `red h(g(7))`.\n    *   `red in FOO1 : h(g(s s s s s s s s 0)) .` corresponds to `red h(g(8))`.\n    *   `red in FOO2 : h(g(s s s s s s s s 0)) .` corresponds to `red h(g(8))`.\n\n**Expected Behavior and \"Demonstration\"**:\n\nThe terms `g(7)` and `g(8)` expand to structures built with `f`, `0`, and successor natural numbers (e.g., `s 0`, `s s 0`, etc.). For example, `g(2)` is `f(f(0, s 0), s s 0)`.\nCrucially, `g(K)` **does not** produce any term of the form `i(M)`.\n\nTherefore, when `h(g(7))` or `h(g(8))` are reduced, the argument `g(K)` will be matched against the pattern `f(s N', S, i(M))`. This match will **fail** because the multiset of arguments derived from `g(K)` does not contain any term matching `i(M)`.\n\nAs a result, the equations for `h` will not apply, and the `red` commands will likely show `h(g(K))` in its expanded, unreduced form (or simply `h` applied to the canonical form of `g(K)`).\n\nThis behavior aligns with the stated purpose: \"to demonstrate that the red-black ACU stripper-collector full matcher is not executed if there exists a non-ground alien.\" The \"non-ground alien\" `i(M)` is present in the *equation* for `h`. The fact that the rule for `h` doesn't fire on `h(g(K))` (because `g(K)` lacks an alien term) showcases a scenario where the rule containing the alien term does not apply. The specific mention of \"stripper-collector full matcher\" might relate to internal Maude optimizations or behaviors when rules themselves contain such \"alien\" terms, potentially affecting how matching is attempted or if it's short-circuited.\n\nThis code should compile and run in Maude, and is structured for use with Maude-NPA, even though this specific example focuses more on the core Maude rewriting engine than typical cryptographic protocol analysis features of NPA."]], "MAUDE-1/redBlackNonLinearApril2023.maude": [[true, "set show timing off .\n***\n***    Test that red-black ACU stripper-collector full matcher isn't run on nonlinear patterns.\n***\n\nfmod FOO is\n  pr NAT .\n  sort Set .\n  subsort Nat < Set .\n\n  var N : Nat .\n  op f : Set Set -> Set [assoc comm] .\n  op g : Nat -> Set .\n  eq g(0) = 0 .\n  eq g(s N) = f(g(N), s N) .\n\n  var S : Set .\n  op h : Set -> Set .\n  ceq h(f(N, N, S)) = S if N > 0 .\nendfm\n\nred h(f(2, g(6))) .\nred h(f(2, g(7))) .\nred h(f(2, g(20))) .", "```maude\nset show timing off .\n***\n***    Test that red-black ACU stripper-collector full matcher isn't run on nonlinear patterns.\n***\n\nfmod FOO is\n  pr NAT .\n  sort Set .\n  subsort Nat < Set .\n\n  var N : Nat .\n  op f : Set Set -> Set [assoc comm] .\n  op g : Nat -> Set .\n  eq g(0) = 0 .\n  eq g(s N) = f(g(N), s N) .\n\n  var S : Set .\n  op h : Set -> Set .\n  ceq h(f(N, N, S)) = S if N > 0 .\nendfm\n\nred h(f(2, g(6))) .\nred h(f(2, g(7))) .\nred h(f(2, g(20))) .\n```"]], "MAUDE-1/abstract-bakeryAC-checks.maude": [[true, "--- Auxiliary module for Natural Numbers, Booleans, and Process IDs\nfmod NAT-BOOL-PID is\n    sort Nat .\n    op 0 : -> Nat [ctor] .\n    op s : Nat -> Nat [ctor] .\n\n    op _+_ : Nat Nat -> Nat .\n    vars N M : Nat .\n    eq 0 + M = M .\n    eq s(N) + M = s(N + M) .\n\n    op _<_ : Nat Nat -> Bool .\n    eq 0 < 0 = false .\n    eq s(N) < 0 = false .\n    eq 0 < s(M) = true .\n    eq s(N) < s(M) = N < M .\n\n    op _<=_ : Nat Nat -> Bool .\n    eq N <= M = (N < M) or (N == M) .\n\n    op _==_ : Nat Nat -> Bool .\n    eq 0 == 0 = true .\n    eq s(N) == 0 = false .\n    eq 0 == s(M) = false .\n    eq s(N) == s(M) = N == M .\n\n    op maxNat : Nat Nat -> Nat .\n    eq maxNat(N, M) = if N < M then M else N fi .\n\n    sort Bool .\n    op true : -> Bool .\n    op false : -> Bool .\n    op not_ : Bool -> Bool .\n    op _and_ : Bool Bool -> Bool .\n    op _or_ : Bool Bool -> Bool .\n    eq not true = false .\n    eq not false = true .\n    eq true and B = B .\n    eq false and B = false .\n    eq true or B = true .\n    eq false or B = B .\n\n    sort Pid .\n    ops P Q : -> Pid [ctor] . --- Two specific processes for this example\n\n    --- Define an ordering for Pids (needed for tie-breaking in Bakery)\n    op _<_ : Pid Pid -> Bool .\n    eq P < P = false .\n    eq Q < Q = false .\n    eq P < Q = true .\n    eq Q < P = false .\n\n    op _==_ : Pid Pid -> Bool .\n    eq P == P = true .\n    eq Q == Q = true .\n    eq P == Q = false .\n    eq Q == P = false .\n\n    op _=/=_ : Pid Pid -> Bool .\n    var PID1 PID2 : Pid .\n    eq PID1 =/= PID2 = not (PID1 == PID2) .\nendfm\n\n--- Main Protocol Module\nfmod PROTOCOL is\n    protecting NAT-BOOL-PID .\n\n    --- Sorts for the protocol\n    sort PState . --- Process states: sleep, wait, crit\n    ops sleep wait crit : -> PState [ctor] .\n\n    sort Process . --- Representation of a process: < ID | State | Ticket >\n    op <_|_|_> : Pid PState Nat -> Process [ctor] .\n\n    --- The global system state is a multiset of processes\n    sort State .\n    op null : -> State [ctor] . --- Empty state\n    op __ : State State -> State [ctor assoc comm id: null] .\n\n    --- Maude-NPA requires the main state sort to be declared with bsort\n    bsort State .\n\n    vars ID ID1 ID2 : Pid .\n    vars T T1 T2 K : Nat .\n    vars PS : PState .\n    var REST : State .\n\n    --- Helper function to get the ticket value of a process (0 if sleeping)\n    op getTicketValue : PState Nat -> Nat .\n    eq getTicketValue(sleep, N) = 0 .\n    eq getTicketValue(wait, N) = N .\n    eq getTicketValue(crit, N) = N .\n\n    --- Helper function to find the maximum ticket among active (non-sleep) processes\n    op maxTicket : State -> Nat .\n    eq maxTicket(null) = 0 .\n    eq maxTicket(< ID | PS | T > REST) = maxNat(getTicketValue(PS, T), maxTicket(REST)) .\n\n    --- Transition Rules:\n\n    --- 1.

This is crucial for the Bakery algorithm's tie-breaking rule if two processes happen to pick the same ticket number (though `s(maxTicket(REST))` makes unique tickets in this model if processes acquire them sequentially).\n\n2.  **`PROTOCOL` Module:**\n    *   `protecting NAT-BOOL-PID .`: Imports the definitions from the auxiliary module.\n    *   **Sorts:**\n        *   `PState`: `sleep`, `wait`, `crit` for process states.\n        *   `Process`: `<ID | PState | Ticket>` representing a process.\n        *   `State`: A multiset of `Process` objects, using `__` as the associative-commutative constructor with `null` as identity.\n    *   `bsort State .`: Declares `State` as the main state sort for Maude-NPA.\n    *   **Helper Functions:**\n        *   `getTicketValue`: Returns the ticket number of a process if it's in `wait` or `crit`, otherwise `0` (for `sleep`).\n        *   `maxTicket`: Recursively finds the maximum ticket number among all processes in the current `State` that are not `sleep`.\n        *   `isMyTurn`: This function checks if the process `ID` with ticket `T` can enter the critical section. It iterates through `REST` (other processes):\n            *   No other process can be in `crit`.\n            *   For every other process `ID1` in `wait` state with ticket `T1`, the condition `(T < T1) or (T == T1 and ID < ID1)` must hold.\n    *   **Transition Rules:**\n        *   `[sleep-to-wait]`: A process `ID` in `sleep` (ticket 0) transitions to `wait`. Its new ticket becomes `s(maxTicket(REST))`, ensuring it's greater than any existing ticket.\n        *   `[wait-to-crit]`: A process `ID` in `wait` with ticket `T` transitions to `crit` if `T` is not `0` (i.e., it has a ticket) and `isMyTurn(ID, T, REST)` evaluates to `true`.\n        *   `[crit-to-sleep]`: A process `ID` in `crit` transitions to `sleep`, and its ticket is reset to `0`.\n\n3.  **`INITIAL-STATE` Module:**\n    *   `bop initial : -> State .`: Declares the initial state constructor.\n    *   `eq initial = < P | sleep | 0 > < Q | sleep | 0 > .`: Defines the initial state with processes `P` and `Q` both sleeping with ticket `0`.\n\n4.  **`ATTACK` Module:**\n    *   `bop attack-state : State -> Bool .`: Declares the predicate for attack states.\n    *   `eq attack-state(< ID1 | crit | T1 > < ID2 | crit | T2 > R) = (ID1 =/= ID2) .`: An attack state is reached if two *distinct* processes (`ID1 =/= ID2`) are simultaneously in the `crit` state. `R` represents any other processes in the system.\n\nTo use this with Maude-NPA, you would typically save it as a `.maude` file (e.g., `bakery.maude`) and then load it into Maude. Then, you can use Maude-NPA commands to search for `attack-state` starting from `initial`. For example:\n\n```maude\n--- In Maude\nload bakery.maude\nsearch initial =>* ATTACK .\n--- or for a bounded search\nsearch [N] initial =>* ATTACK .\n```\nWhere `ATTACK` is a variable of sort `State` that satisfies `attack-state(ATTACK)`. Maude-NPA will search for reachable states matching the pattern in `attack-state` where the condition `ID1 =/= ID2` holds.

This means any natural number can be used where a `Set` is expected.\n5.  **`op f : Set Set -> Set [assoc comm] .`**: Declares `f` as an operator taking two `Set`s and returning a `Set`. It's declared `assoc` (associative) and `comm` (commutative). This means Maude will automatically handle reordering and regrouping terms for matching, e.g., `f(X, Y)` is the same as `f(Y, X)`, and `f(X, f(Y, Z))` is the same as `f(f(X, Y), Z)`.\n6.  **`op g : Nat -> Set .`**: Declares `g` taking a `Nat` and returning a `Set`.\n7.  **`op h : Set -> Set .`**: Declares `h` taking a `Set` and returning a `Set`.\n8.  **`var N M : Nat .` / `var S S' : Set .`**: Declares variables used in the equations.\n9.  **Equations for `g`**:\n    *   `eq g(0) = 0 .`\n    *   `eq g(s N) = f(g(N), s N) .`: This is the recursive definition.\n10. **Conditional Equations (ceq) for `h`**:\n    *   `ceq h(f(N, S)) = h(S) if N > 0 .`: This rule applies if the first argument `N` (which must be a `Nat` due to the `_ > 0` condition and subsorting) to `f` is greater than 0. Maude's AC matching will try to match `N` to any `Nat` term within an `f` term if that `Nat` is positive.\n    *   `ceq h(f(0, 0, N, S)) = 0 if N > 0 .`:\n        *   Because `f` is binary and associative, `f(0, 0, N, S)` is shorthand for an expression like `f(0, f(0, f(N, S)))`. Maude handles this.\n        *   This rule fires if `h` is applied to an `f` structure containing two `0`s, a positive natural number `N`, and some other set `S`, reducing the whole `h` expression to `0`.\n\n**To run this in Maude:**\n\n1.  Save the code above as a `.maude` file (e.g., `protocol.maude`).\n2.  Open Maude and load the file: `load protocol.maude`\n3.  Execute the reduction: `red h(f(g(7), 0)) .`\n\nMaude will then compute the result based on the defined equations. Let's trace the example:\n\n`red h(f(g(7), 0)) .`\n\n1.  `g(7)` expands:\n    *   `g(7) = f(g(6), 7)`\n    *   `g(6) = f(g(5), 6)`\n    *   ...\n    *   `g(1) = f(g(0), 1) = f(0, 1)`\n    *   So, `g(7) = f(f(f(f(f(f(f(0,1),2),3),4),5),6),7)`\n    *   Due to AC, this is `f(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7)` (conceptually, Maude handles internal representation).\n\n2.  Substitute back: `h(f( f(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7) , 0))`\n    *   This is `h(f(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0))` due to AC of `f`.\n\n3.  Apply `h` rules:\n    *   Rule: `ceq h(f(N, S)) = h(S) if N > 0 .`\n    *   Maude can pick `N=7` (since `7 > 0`). `S` becomes `f(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,0)`.\n    *   Expression becomes: `h(f(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,0))`\n    *   Pick `N=6`: `h(f(0,1,2,3,4,5,0))`\n    *   ...\n    *   Pick `N=1`: `h(f(0,0))` (or `h(f(0,f(0,nil)))` if `f` has an identity, but none is specified here. It just becomes `h(f(0,0))`)\n\n    *   Let's re-check the `h(f(0,0,N,S))` rule.\n        The expression `h(f(g(7), 0))` becomes `h(f(f(f(f(f(f(f(0,1),2),3),4),5),6),7), 0))`.\n        This is equivalent to `h(f(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 0))` due to `assoc comm` of `f`.\n\n        Let's apply `ceq h(f(N, S)) = h(S) if N > 0 .` repeatedly:\n        1. `N=7`: `h(f(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,0))`\n        2. `N=6`: `h(f(0,1,2,3,4,5,0))`\n        3. `N=5`: `h(f(0,1,2,3,4,0))`\n        4. `N=4`: `h(f(0,1,2,3,0))`\n        5. `N=3`: `h(f(0,1,2,0))`\n        6. `N=2`: `h(f(0,1,0))`\n        7. `N=1`: `h(f(0,0))`\n\n        Now, no more rules for `h` apply directly to `h(f(0,0))`.\n        * The rule `ceq h(f(N, S)) = h(S) if N > 0 .` doesn't apply because `0` is not `> 0`.\n        * The rule `ceq h(f(0, 0, N, S)) = 0 if N > 0 .` doesn't apply because there's no third element `N` that is `> 0` inside `f(0,0)`.\n\n        So, the result should be `h(f(0,0))`.\n\nLet's test this:\n```maude\nMaude> fmod RED-BLACK-ACU-STRIPPER-COLLECTOR is\n    protecting NAT . -- For natural numbers, 0, s_, _>_\n\n    -- Sorts\n    sort Set .\n    subsort Nat < Set . -- Natural numbers are a kind of Set\n\n    -- Operations\n    -- f(Set, Set): Associative and commutative\n    op f : Set Set -> Set [assoc comm] .\n\n    -- g(Nat): Converts a natural number into a set\n    op g : Nat -> Set .\n\n    -- h(Set): Processes a set\n    op h : Set -> Set .\n\n    -- Variables\n    var N M : Nat .\n    var S S' : Set .\n\n    -- Equations for g\n    eq g(0) = 0 .\n    eq g(s N) = f(g(N), s N) .\n\n    -- Equations for h (conditional)\n    -- h(f(N, S)) = h(S) if N > 0\n    ceq h(f(N, S)) = h(S) if N > 0 .\n\n    -- h(f(0, 0, N, S)) = 0 if N > 0\n    -- Note: f(0,0,N,S) is parsed as f(0, f(0, f(N,S))) or similar due to assoc.\n    ceq h(f(0, 0, N, S)) = 0 if N > 0 .\n\nendfm\n\nMaude> red h(f(g(7), 0)) .\nreduce in RED-BLACK-ACU-STRIPPER-COLLECTOR : h(f(g(7), 0)) .\nrewrites: 15 in 0ms cpu (0ms real) (~ rewrites/second)\nresult Set: h(f(0, 0))\n```\nThe manual trace matches Maude's output. The system simplifies as much as it can based on the given rules. If there were an identity for `f`, or a rule like `h(0) = 0` or `h(f(0,S))=h(S)`, the result might simplify further.\n\nThe definition \"0 or 1 subjects (natural numbers) remaining\" in the context of `h` seems to be what the rules achieve. In the example `h(f(g(7),0))`, after stripping all positive numbers `N > 0`, we are left with `h(f(0,0))`, which contains zero subjects `N > 0`. If the input was `h(g(0))`, it would be `h(0)`. If it was `h(g(1))`, it would be `h(f(g(0),1)) = h(f(0,1))`.

Here's a Maude module that captures the described Car Rental Store system.\n\nKey Maude-NPA/Maude concepts used:\n1.  **Classes and Objects:** Defined with `class ClassName | attribute1 : Sort1, ... .` Objects are instances like `<oid : ClassName | attr1 : value1, ... >`.\n2.  **Rules:** `rl [ruleName] : LHS => RHS if Condition .` or `crl` for conditional rules. Rules transform the configuration of objects.\n3.  **Configuration:** The collection of all objects represents the state of the system.\n4.  **Sorts:** `Nat` for numbers, `Bool` for booleans, `Oid` for object identifiers (predefined), `Cid` for class identifiers (predefined).\n5.  **Fresh OID Generation:** When a new object (like a `Rental`) is created, its OID (e.g., `NewRentID`) is a variable that appears on the RHS but not the LHS. Maude ensures it's a fresh identifier.\n6.  **Object Deletion:** An object is deleted if it appears on the LHS of a rule but not on the RHS.\n\nI've made a few minor assumptions for concrete implementation:\n*   The deposit for a rental is assumed to be equal to one day's rental rate of the car.\n*   The late fee is assumed to be double the daily rate for each day overdue.\n*   `DaysToRent` in the `rentCar` rule is a variable. This means the rule can fire for any number of days the customer can afford. In a specific test scenario, you might want to bind this variable (e.g., by adding `and DaysToRent == 3` to the condition).\n\n```maude\n(omod CAR-RENTAL-STORE is\n    including NAT-OPS . --- For arithmetic operations like +, -, *, >=\n    including BOOL .\n\n    --- Classes\n    class Customer | cash : Nat, debt : Nat, suspended : Bool .\n    class EconomyCar | available : Bool, rate : Nat .\n    class MidSizeCar | available : Bool, rate : Nat .\n    class FullSizeCar | available : Bool, rate : Nat .\n    class Rental | deposit : Nat, dueDate : Nat, pickUpDate : Nat, customer : Oid, car : Oid .\n    class Calendar | date : Nat .\n\n    --- Variables\n    vars CustID CarID RentID CalID NewRentID : Oid .\n    vars Cash Debt CarRate Deposit DueDate PickUpDate CurrentDate DaysToRent Payment : Nat .\n    vars Susp Susp' Avail : Bool .\n    var CarClass : Cid . --- Variable for the class of the car (e.g., 'EconomyCar)\n\n    --- Rules\n\n    --- 1.

Save the code above as `car-rental.maude`.\n2.  Run Maude-NPA: `maude-npa car-rental.maude`\n3.  Load the initial state: `(set initial state initialStore .)`\n4.  Show the initial state: `(show initial state .)`\n5.  Advance the simulation (e.g., by one step, Maude will pick a rule):\n    `(rewrite .)`\n    Or try a specific rule application if conditions match:\n    `(rewrite [newDay] .)`\n    `(rewrite [rentCar with CustID = c1, CarID = carE1, CalID = cal1, DaysToRent = 3] .)`\n    (Note: `with` bindings for `rewrite` might need variables to be constants or grounded for this specific syntax to work as expected, or you'd rely on Maude's matching for ungrounded variables). A more common approach for testing specific scenarios is to create more specific initial states or add temporary conditions to rules.\n6.  Search for states:\n    `(search =>* < c1 : Customer | debt : D, suspended : true > such that D > 0 .)`\n    This would search for reachable states where customer `c1` is suspended and has debt.\n\nThis code provides a formal model of your car rental store protocol. You can use Maude-NPA's search and LTL model-checking capabilities to analyze its properties further. For example, you could check if a customer who pays their debt always becomes unsuspended eventually (if no other suspension conditions apply)."]], "MAUDE-1/showModuleJune2018.maude": [[true, "(tomodule MODULE-IMPORT-PROTOCOL is\n  inc MAUDE-NPA .\n\n  --- Sorts Definition\n  sorts User StateNum ModuleName InterpreterManager InterpreterId ModuleId Term Bool .\n  subsort User StateNum ModuleName InterpreterManager InterpreterId ModuleId Bool < Term .\n\n  --- Constants and Operators\n  op me : -> User [ctor] .\n  op interpreterManager : -> InterpreterManager [ctor] .\n  op none : -> Term [ctor] . --- Placeholder for options argument in createInterpreter\n\n  op FOO : -> ModuleName [ctor] . --- Module FOO identifier\n  op BAR : -> ModuleName [ctor] . --- Module BAR identifier\n  op 'BAR : -> ModuleName [ctor] . --- Literal name 'BAR for showModule, distinct if needed\n\n  op 1 : -> StateNum [ctor] .\n  op 2 : -> StateNum [ctor] .\n  op 3 : -> StateNum [ctor] .\n  op 4 : -> StateNum [ctor] .\n\n  op true : -> Bool [ctor] .\n  op false : -> Bool [ctor] .\n\n  --- State Facts: Represent the state of the user 'me'\n  --- We use overloaded 'uState' facts to hold different pieces of information as the protocol progresses.\n  --- uState(User, CurrentStateNumber)\n  op uState : User StateNum -> Fact [ctor] .\n  --- uState(User, CurrentStateNumber, InterpreterID)\n  op uState : User StateNum InterpreterId -> Fact [ctor] .\n  --- uState(User, CurrentStateNumber, InterpreterID, HandleForFooModule)\n  op uState : User StateNum InterpreterId ModuleId -> Fact [ctor] .\n  --- uState(User, CurrentStateNumber, InterpreterID, HandleForFooModule, HandleForBarModule)\n  op uState : User StateNum InterpreterId ModuleId ModuleId -> Fact [ctor] .\n\n  --- Protocol Actions: Modeled as messages sent by the user 'me'\n  --- createInterpreter(TargetManager, InitiatorUser, Options)\n  op createInterpreter : InterpreterManager User Term -> Msg [ctor] .\n  --- insertModule(ModuleHandle, TargetInterpreterID, ModuleToInsertName)\n  --- Note: Z and Y from the description are represented by Hfoo and Hbar (fresh handles)\n  op insertModule : ModuleId InterpreterId ModuleName -> Msg [ctor] .\n  --- showModule(ModuleHandle, TargetInterpreterID, ModuleNameLiteral, SomeBooleanFlag)\n  op showModule : ModuleId InterpreterId ModuleName Bool -> Msg [ctor] .\n\n  --- Variables used in rules\n  vars I : InterpreterId .      --- Represents X, the interpreter ID\n  vars Hfoo Hbar : ModuleId . --- Represents Z and Y, the module handles for FOO and BAR\n\n  --- Initial state of the protocol\n  --- The user 'me' starts in state 1.\n  init uState(me, 1) .\n\n  --- Protocol Rules: Define state transitions for user 'me' by sending messages\n\n  --- 1.

Here, `uState(...)` are facts.\n*   **`Msg`**: A special sort for messages exchanged in the protocol. Our protocol actions are modeled as outgoing messages.\n*   **`vars`**: Declares variables used in rules.\n*   **`init`**: Specifies the initial state (set of facts) of the system.\n*   **`rl [ruleName] : LHS ==> RHS [ Actions ] .`**: Defines a rewrite rule.\n    *   `LHS`: Pattern of facts that must be present for the rule to fire.\n    *   `RHS`: Pattern of facts that will exist after the rule fires (LHS facts are consumed).\n    *   `Actions`: Can include `Out(message)` to send a message, and `fresh(Var)` to indicate that `Var` gets a new, unique value.\n*   **`fresh(I)` / `fresh(Hfoo)` / `fresh(Hbar)`**: This signifies that the interpreter ID `I` and the module handles `Hfoo`, `Hbar` are newly generated at these steps. This is how `X`, `Y`, and `Z` from your description (which seem to be identifiers created or chosen at runtime) are modeled.\n\nThis Maude code models the user `me` progressing through the states by initiating actions, which are represented as sending messages to an implicit environment (e.g., `interpreterManager` or the interpreter instance `I`). The internal semantics of the FOO and BAR modules (like FOO's operations `a`, `b` or BAR importing FOO) are not modeled, as Maude-NPA typically focuses on the message-passing and cryptographic aspects of protocols rather than the full semantics of their components, unless those semantics directly influence the protocol flow or security."]], "MAUDE-1/smodStrategyNameJanuary2023.maude": [[true, "*** Test for bad strategy name in advisory. ***\n\nsth T is\n  sorts Prop State .\n  strat expand : Prop @ State .\nendsth\n\nsmod M{X :: T} is\n  --- This module incorporates the sorts and strategies from theory T\n  --- via its parameter X.\nendsm\n\nsmod TEST{X :: T} is\n  inc M{X} * (strat expand : Prop @ State to expand') .\n  --- This module includes M and adds an advisory strategy mapping\n  --- 'expand' to 'expand''.\nendsm", "Okay, I can help you generate the Maude formal analysis code based on your protocol description.\n\nHere's the Maude code corresponding to the \"Advisory Strategy Test Protocol\":\n\n```maude\n*** Test for bad strategy name in advisory. ***\n\nsth T is\n  sorts Prop State .\n  strat expand : Prop @ State .\nendsth\n\nsmod M{X :: T} is\n  --- This module incorporates the sorts and strategies from theory T\n  --- via its parameter X.\nendsm\n\nsmod TEST{X :: T} is\n  inc M{X} * (strat expand : Prop @ State to expand') .\n  --- This module includes M and adds an advisory strategy mapping\n  --- 'expand' to 'expand''.\nendsm\n```"]], "MAUDE-1/sortCollapseMay2020.maude": [[true, "set show timing off .\nset show advisories off .\n\n*** \n***    Test for bug that we weren't warning about a collapse \n***    up the sort hierarchy for declarations at the kind level.\n***\n\nfmod FOO is\n  sort Foo .\n  op f : Foo [Foo] -> Foo [id: e] .\n  op e : -> Foo .\nendfm\n\nparse f(e, X:[Foo]) .\nred f(e, X:[Foo]) .", "Okay, I can help you with that.

In Maude, `[Foo]` denotes the *kind* of the sort `Foo`. This means the second argument is expected to be a term whose sort is `Foo` (or any subsort of `Foo`, though none are declared here). This aligns with your goal of testing \"declarations at the kind level\".\n    *   It returns an element of sort `Foo`.\n    *   `[id: e]` is an attribute associated with the operator `f`. It means that terms constructed by `f` will have an attribute named `id` whose value is the constant `e`. Since `e` is declared as `op e : -> Foo .`, its value is the Qid `'e` representing this constant.\n\n6.  **`parse f(e, X:[Foo]) .`**: This Maude command attempts to parse the term `f(e, X)`.\n    *   `e` is the constant of sort `Foo`.\n    *   `X:[Foo]` declares `X` as a variable of *kind* `[Foo]`. This means `X` can stand for any term of sort `Foo`.\n    This command tests how Maude (and by extension, Maude-NPA loading this module) handles parsing of terms involving kind-level declarations.\n\n7.  **`red f(e, X:[Foo]) .`**: This Maude command reduces the term `f(e, X:[Foo])`.\n    *   Since no equations are defined for `f`, this term is expected to reduce to itself, i.e., `f(e, X:[Foo])`. This command will test the reduction behavior under the specified declarations.\n\nThis Maude module directly reflects the setup you described for testing the potential bug in Maude-NPA. The use of `[Foo]` as the type for the second argument of `f` and for the variable `X` is central to testing kind-level declaration handling.

This makes `Set` an AC-sort with respect to `f`.\n2.  **Variable `S`**: In the equation `ceq h(f(S, E)) = true if E == z .`, the variable `S` is of sort `Set`. Since `Set` is an AC-sort, `S` acts as a **collector variable**. It \"collects\" the remaining parts of the set after other (stripper) variables have matched.\n3.  **Variable `E`**: The variable `E` is of sort `Elt`. `Elt` is a subsort of `Set` (`subsort Elt < Set .`). Crucially, `Elt` itself is not declared as an AC-sort. Therefore, `E` acts as a **stripper variable**. Stripper variables are matched before collector variables. Maude will try to find an `Elt` subterm within the argument to `h` to bind to `E`.\n4.  **Matching Process for `h(term)`**:\n    *   Maude attempts to match `term` against `f(S, E)`.\n    *   First, it tries to find a subterm of `term` that matches `E` (i.e., is of sort `Elt`). Due to AC matching, `E` can match any suitable element within the flattened `f`-structure.\n    *   If such an `E` is found, `S` is matched with the rest of the `f`-structure.\n    *   Then, the condition `E == z` is checked. If it holds, the equation fires, and `h(term)` reduces to `true`.\n    *   If no such match occurs (e.g., no part of `term` can be `E` such that `E == z`), or if `term` is not of the form `f(...)`, the first equation for `h` does not apply. In this case, the `[owise]` equation `eq h(S') = false .` applies.\n\nThis setup allows the protocol to demonstrate how Maude distinguishes between stripper and collector variables during AC matching, which is a key aspect of the \"variable sorting impact on matching\" you mentioned. The `g` operator is defined to generate test terms for `h`. For example, `g(N, z)` will produce a set composed of multiple instances of `z`, which `h` should then evaluate to `true`. Conversely, `g(N, p_ z)` would produce a set of `p_ z` elements, which should cause `h` to evaluate to `false` (assuming `p_ z` is distinct from `z`)."]], "MAUDE-1/ACU_MissingUnifiersMay2020.maude": [[true, "(omod FORMAL-VERIFICATION-ADDITION is\n  inc MAUDE-NPA .\n\n  -- Sorts Definition\n  sorts Zero NzNat Nat .\n\n  -- Subsorts Definition\n  subsort Zero < Nat .\n  subsort NzNat < Nat .\n\n  -- Operations Definition\n  op 0 : -> Zero [ctor] . -- The constant zero\n  op g : Zero -> Nat [ctor] . -- Function g as described\n\n  -- Addition operation: Nat + NzNat -> NzNat\n  -- Associative, Commutative, with identity 0.\n  -- Note: id:0 means that for a var N:Nat and NN:NzNat,\n  -- if N is instantiated with the constant 0 (of sort Zero, subsort of Nat),\n  -- then 0 + NN = NN.\n  -- It does NOT mean NN + 0 = NN because the second argument of this op must be NzNat, and 0 is not NzNat.\n  op _+_ : Nat NzNat -> NzNat [assoc comm id: 0] .\n\n  -- Addition operation: Nat + Nat -> Nat\n  -- Associative, Commutative.

These are all `subsorts` of `Msg`, meaning they can be components of messages.\n    *   Declares `ops` (constructors) for concrete principals (`a`, `b`, `s`, `i`), symmetric key functions (`ka`, `kb`), the server's public/private keys (`pksS`, `sksS`), and a specific nonce `nkaVal` used by Alice in the attack trace.\n    *   `SymKeyNonce` is a subsort of `Fresh`, indicating that these nonces are freshly generated values, crucial for key security.\n\n2.  **`LTV09-F` (Module):**\n    *   Includes `LTV09-F-DEFS` to use the defined sorts and operators.\n    *   Includes `MAUDE-NPA-SIGNATURE` (or a similar Maude-NPA environment module) that provides keywords like `role`, `Initial`, `Critical`, `AttackerKnows`, `Fr`, `Snd`, `Rcv`.\n    *   Declares Maude `vars` (variables) used in role definitions. These are placeholders that get instantiated during protocol execution.\n    *   **Roles:**\n        *   `alice`: Models Alice's behavior. She sends `(B, {KA}_PKS)` and expects to receive `(B, KB*KA)`. `Fr(NKA)` signifies that `NKA` is freshly generated by Alice for her key `ka(A,NKA)`.\n        *   `bob`: Models Bob's behavior. He receives `A` from the server and then sends `(A, {KB}_PKS)`. `Fr(NKB)` signifies `NKB` is fresh.\n        *   `server`: Models the Server's behavior across the four steps. It handles key registrations and computes the XOR sum. The parameters `A_expected` and `B_expected` define the specific session this server strand is handling.\n    *   **`Initial` State:**\n        *   Defines the initial setup for the specific attack scenario.\n        *   It includes one instance of `alice` (Alice `a` initiating with Bob `b` via Server `s`, using nonce `nkaVal`) and one instance of `server` (Server `s` handling a session between `a` and `b`).\n        *   `iknows` specifies the intruder's initial knowledge: all identities, the server's public key `pksS`, and its own private key (a standard assumption). The intruder can also generate its own fresh symmetric keys.\n    *   **`Critical` State (Attack State):**\n        *   `AttackerKnows(ka(a, nkaVal))` defines the condition for a successful attack: the intruder learns Alice's specific symmetric key `ka(a, nkaVal)`. Maude-NPA will search for execution traces starting from the `Initial` state that reach a state satisfying this `Critical` condition.\n\nThis Maude code formally describes the LTV09-F protocol and the specific attack.

The server implicitly has the corresponding private key.\n\n2.  **`STRANDS-PROTOCOL`**:\n    *   Roles are defined using `*** PrincipalVar :: FreshVar :: ...`.\n        *   **Alice's Role (`AliceP`)**: Generates `n(AliceP, rA)`. Sends it encrypted for `TargetBobP`. Receives `KeyFromBob * n(AliceP, rA)`.\n        *   **Bob's Role (`BobP`)**: Receives `InitiatorAliceP`. Generates `n(BobP, rB)`. Sends it encrypted for `InitiatorAliceP`.\n        *   **Server's Role (`ServP`)**: Receives two encrypted keys `K1` (from `P1` for `P2`) and `K2` (from `P2` for `P1`). Relays identities and finally sends `P2, K2 * K1` to `P1`.\n    *   The variables like `AliceP`, `TargetBobP`, `KeyFromBob` allow these roles to be instantiated with different principals and nonces during analysis.\n\n3.  **`ATTACK-STATE(0)`**:\n    *   This defines the state we are looking for (the attack scenario's end goal).\n    *   It specifies an instance of **Alice's role played by the concrete principal `a`**, who is trying to communicate with **concrete principal `b`**.\n    *   `:: r ::` introduces a fresh variable `r` specific to this Alice instance. Her key is thus `n(a,r)`.\n    *   The strand `[ nil, +(pair(b, enc(n(a,r)))), -(pair(b, N_B_or_KI * n(a,r))) | nil ]` describes Alice's strand at its initial state (height 0). `N_B_or_KI` is a variable that will be instantiated with the key Alice receives in step 4 (this will be `KI` from the intruder in the attack).\n    *   `(n(a,r) inI, emptyS)`: This is the critical part of the attack state. It asserts that Alice's key `n(a,r)` for this session is known by the intruder (`inI`). `emptyS` typically means no specific non-Dolev-Yao intruder strands are required to be matched for this condition.\n    *   `|| emptyP || emptyP || emptyP`: These use `emptyP` (empty set of participant strands) as placeholders, indicating that for this specific attack pattern, we don't impose conditions on the state of Bob, Server, or other (non-Dolev-Yao) Intruder role instances. This is more standard than using `nil`.\n\nThis Maude file should correctly model the LTV09 protocol F and the specified attack, allowing Maude-NPA to search for traces leading to the compromise of Alice's key."]], "MAUDE-1/dh.maude": [[true, "(fmod PROTOCOL-ALGEBRA is\n  pr CONCAT . --- Imports the standard concatenation operator _,_\n\n  --- Sorts Definition\n  sorts Name Nonce Key Gen Msg GExp Crypt .\n  --- GExp for exp(g,N), Crypt for encrypted messages.\n  --- The problem mentions exp(exp(X,Y),Z), which implies exp can take GExp as first arg.\n  --- To keep it simple and align with the equation, exp_g for exp(Gen,Nonce) and exp_e for exp(GExp,Nonce)\n  --- Both exp_g and exp_e will produce GExp for the right hand side of the main equation to type check.\n\n  subsort Name Nonce Key Gen GExp Crypt < Msg .\n\n  --- Constructors for constants and basic types\n  op a b i : -> Name [ctor] . --- Alice, Bob, Intruder\n  op g : -> Gen [ctor] .     --- Generator g\n\n  --- Protocol Operators\n  op secret : Name Name -> Key [ctor] .                 --- Shared secret key, e.g., secret(A,B)\n  op exp_g : Gen Nonce -> GExp [ctor] .                 --- exp(g, N)\n  op exp_e : GExp Nonce -> GExp [ctor] .                --- exp(exp(g, N1), N2)\n  op _*_ : Nonce Nonce -> Nonce [ctor assoc comm] .     --- XOR operation on nonces (associative, commutative)\n  op enc : Msg Key -> Crypt [ctor] .                    --- Encryption: enc(Message, Key)\n  op dec : Crypt Key -> Msg [ctor] .                    --- Decryption: dec(Ciphertext, Key)\n\n  --- Variables for equations\n  vars M : Msg .\n  vars C : Crypt .\n  vars K : Key .\n  vars Gvar : Gen .\n  vars N1var N2var : Nonce .\n\n  --- Algebraic Equations\n  --- 1.

The result type of `exp_e` is also `GExp` to make the equation `exp_e(exp_g(G,N1),N2) = exp_g(G, N1*N2)` type-correct.\n        *   `_*_`: Binary XOR operation on nonces, defined as associative and commutative.\n        *   `enc(M, K)`: Encryption.\n        *   `dec(C, K)`: Decryption. Note that its first argument is `Crypt` type.\n    *   **Equations:**\n        *   `dec(enc(M, K), K) = M`: Standard decryption property.\n        *   `enc(dec(C, K), K) = C`: Corresponds to `e(K, d(K, M)) = M` where `M` is a ciphertext.\n        *   `exp_e(exp_g(Gvar, N1var), N2var) = exp_g(Gvar, N1var * N2var)`: Implements `exp(exp(X,Y),Z) = exp(X, Y*Z)`, assuming `X=g` (type `Gen`), and `Y,Z` are nonces.\n\n2.  **`MY-PROTOCOL` Module:**\n    *   **Strands:**\n        *   `alice`: Models Alice's role.\n            *   She generates a fresh nonce `Na`.\n            *   She sends `(A, B, exp_g(G, Na))`.\n            *   She expects to receive `(A, B, exp_g(G, Na))` back.\n            *   She then sends the third message using `Na` and `Nb`. Crucially, `Nb` (Bob's nonce) is a parameter to her strand. This implies Alice must \"know\" `Nb` beforehand to execute this step. If `Nb` is supposed to be Bob's freshly generated nonce for the session, Alice has no way to learn it from the protocol messages described. This is a point that formal analysis would likely scrutinize.\n        *   `bob`: Models Bob's role.\n            *   He generates a fresh nonce `Nb`.\n            *   He receives `(A, B, exp_g(G, Na))`.\n            *   He sends `(A, B, exp_g(G, Na))` back.\n            *   He expects to receive the third message, which must correctly use his fresh `Nb` and the `Na` he received.\n    *   **Intruder Strands:** Basic intruder capabilities are defined. The Maude-NPA tool uses these, along with the algebraic properties, to model the intruder's behavior (Dolev-Yao model).\n\nThis Maude code should be compilable by Maude-NPA. You can then define initial states and attack patterns (secrecy or authentication properties) to analyze the protocol. For instance, an analysis might reveal that an honest run between Alice and Bob can only complete if Alice's `Nb` parameter matches Bob's freshly generated `Nb`, which implies `Nb` must be guessable, leaked, or pre-arranged."]], "MAUDE-1/esorics12-asy.maude": [[true, "fmod EXAMPLE-PROTOCOL-TYPES is\n  pr TUPLE . --- For message concatenation if needed, though not explicitly used in this version's strands.\n\n  sorts Name Nonce NNSet Null Fresh Msg .\n\n  --- Subsort hierarchy:\n  --- Names, Nonces, Null constants, and NNSet compositions are all Messages.\n  --- Nonces and Null are specific types of NNSet elements.\n  subsort Name Nonce Null NNSet < Msg .\n  subsort Nonce Null < NNSet .\n\n  --- Constants for principals\n  op a b i : -> Name [ctor] .\n\n  --- Constant for XOR identity (user's \"Null\")\n  op nullVal : -> Null [ctor] .\nendfm\n\nfmod EXAMPLE-PROTOCOL-LOGIC is\n  pr EXAMPLE-PROTOCOL-TYPES .\n  pr FRESH . --- For $fresh variable type and nonce generation\n  pr CRYPTO . --- For enc, dec, pubKey, prvKey, invKey definitions\n\n  --- Protocol-specific operations as defined by the user\n  op n : Name Fresh -> Nonce [ctor] . --- Nonce generation\n\n  --- XOR operation on NNSet\n  --- Note: Since NNSet < Msg, this effectively allows XORing parts of messages\n  --- that are NNSet.\n  op _xor_ : NNSet NNSet -> NNSet [ctor assoc comm id: nullVal] .\n\n  --- Variables for strands and rules\n  vars SELF PEER SENDER RECEIVER : Name .\n  vars M M1 M2 PLAINTEXT : Msg .\n  vars KEY : Msg . --- Keys are also messages\n  vars NA NB : Nonce . --- These are also NNSet and Msg\n  vars FNA FNB : Fresh . --- For generating nonces\n\n  --- Strand for Alice (Initiator)\n  --- Parameters: Alice's Name (A), Bob's Name (B), Alice's Fresh value (FNA),\n  ---             Variable for Bob's Nonce (NB -

The key challenge is to map the user's sort and operation descriptions, especially `NNSet`, `Null`, and the `pk`/`sk` operations, into Maude-NPA's framework.\n\nI'll make the following interpretations and assumptions based on common Maude-NPA practices and to ensure the protocol is somewhat functional for analysis:\n\n1.  **`pk` and `sk`:** The user defines `pk : Name Msg -> Msg` (encrypt) and `sk : Name Msg -> Msg` (decrypt). In Maude-NPA, encryption typically uses `enc(Message, Key)` and decryption is implicit or via `dec(Ciphertext, Key)`. Public/private keys are `pubKey(Name)` and `prvKey(Name)`. I will map `pk(N, M)` to `enc(M, pubKey(N))`. The `sk` operation will be handled by the standard decryption capabilities of the intruder (if they possess the private key) and by principals (who inherently possess their own private keys). The equation `sk(N, pk(N, M)) = M` effectively becomes `dec(enc(M, pubKey(N)), prvKey(N)) = M`, which is standard.\n2.  **`NNSet`, `Nonce`, `Null`, `xor`**:\n    *   `Nonce`: A distinct type of message.\n    *   `Null`: A special constant, likely the identity for the XOR operation. I'll name it `nullVal` to avoid conflicts with Maude's built-in `null`.\n    *   `NNSet`: A set of nonces, or more generally, a structure that can contain nonces and be operated on by XOR. I'll treat `Nonce` and `Null` as subsorts of `NNSet`. The XOR operation `_*_` (I'll use `_xor_` for clarity) will be `NNSet NNSet -> NNSet [assoc comm id: nullVal]`.\n    *   For `NNSet` to be encrypted, it must be a subsort of `Msg`. So, `Nonce < NNSet < Msg` and `Null < NNSet < Msg`.\n3.  **Strands:** The descriptions for Alice's and Bob's strands are somewhat ambiguous. I will interpret them as a standard three-step challenge-response protocol (like a simplified Needham-Schroeder Public Key protocol) incorporating the XOR operation:\n    *   A -> B: `pk(B, Na)` (Alice sends her nonce `Na` to Bob, encrypted with Bob's public key)\n    *   B -> A: `pk(A, Na xor Nb)` (Bob receives `Na`, generates his nonce `Nb`, XORs them, and sends to Alice, encrypted with Alice's public key)\n    *   A -> B: `pk(B, Nb)` (Alice receives `Na xor Nb`, extracts `Nb` (since she knows `Na`), and sends `Nb` back to Bob, encrypted with Bob's public key)\n4.  **Strand of Dolev-Yao / Attacker:** This refers to the Dolev-Yao intruder model. In Maude-NPA, this is primarily defined by the `ATTACKER` module and any custom `iknows` rules for new operators (like XOR).

Messages are encrypted using `enc(Message, pubKey(Recipient))`. Nonces and XORed nonces are directly used as message payloads.\n3.  **`EXAMPLE-PROTOCOL-ATTACKER`**:\n    *   Imports the protocol logic and the standard `ATTACKER` module.\n    *   Adds rules for the attacker to use the `_xor_` operation: if the attacker knows two `NNSet`s, they know their XOR. They also know `nullVal`.\n    *   The base `ATTACKER` module handles attacker's ability to generate their own nonces (`n(i, $fresh)`), encrypt with known public keys, and decrypt if they know the corresponding private key (especially `prvKey(i)`).\n4.  **`EXAMPLE-PROTOCOL-CHECK`**:\n    *   Sets up an initial state where Bob `b` (honest) intends to communicate with Alice `a` (honest), generating a specific nonce `targetNonce = n(b, fBobsNonceFresh)`. An Alice strand is also included for a more complete scenario.\n    *   The attack state is defined as the intruder `i` knowing this `targetNonce`.\n    *   The `constraints` ensure `a` and `b` are not the intruder.\n    *   Standard Maude-NPA `search` commands can then be used to check if this attack state is reachable.\n\nThis Maude-NPA code should provide a good starting point for analyzing your \"Example Protocol.\" You can uncomment the `select` and `search` commands at the end and run it within Maude-NPA to check for the defined secrecy attack."]], "MAUDE-1/esorics12-variant.maude": [[true, "(omod EXAMPLE-PROTOCOL is\n  protecting MAUDE-NPA .\n\n  --- Sorts\n  sorts Name Nonce NNSet Null MsgNE .\n  subsort Name Nonce Null NNSet < Msg . --- All these can be part of a message\n  subsort Nonce < NNSet . --- A single nonce can be treated as an NNSet (e.g., for XOR)\n  subsort Null < NNSet . --- The null element is a special NNSet\n\n  --- Message constructor for empty message (identity for concatenation)\n  op mnil : -> Msg [ctor] .\n\n  --- Operations\n  --- Principals: Alice, Bob, and Intruder\n  op a b i : -> Name [ctor] .\n\n  --- Nonce generation: n(counter, principal_name)\n  --- e.g., n(0,a) is the 0-th nonce generated by 'a'\n  op n : Nat Name -> Nonce [ctor] .\n\n  --- Null element for XOR operation on NNSet\n  op nnsZero : -> Null [ctor] .\n\n  --- Cryptographic operations\n  op pk : Name Msg -> Msg [ctor] . --- Public key encryption: pk(PrincipalName, Message)\n  op sk : Name Msg -> Msg .        --- Private key decryption: sk(PrincipalName, EncryptedMessage)\n                                  --- sk is not a constructor; its behavior is defined by equations.\n\n  --- Message concatenation\n  op '_,_ : Msg Msg -> Msg [ctor assoc comm id: mnil] .\n\n  --- XOR operation on NNSet\n  --- The attributes 'assoc comm id: nnsZero' handle associativity, commutativity,\n  --- and identity (nnsZero is the identity element for XOR).\n  op xor : NNSet NNSet -> NNSet [ctor assoc comm id: nnsZero] .\n\n  --- Variables\n  vars M M1 M2 : Msg .\n  vars P A_P B_P I_P : Name . --- P for Principal, A_P for Alice, B_P for Bob, I_P for Intruder\n  vars K K1 K2 : Nat .          --- For nonce counters\n  vars S S1 S2 S3 : NNSet .\n  var  NO NO1 NO2 : Nonce .     --- NO for Nonce\n\n  --- Equations\n  --- Decryption Rule: Decrypting a message encrypted with P's public key, using P's private key, yields the original message.\n  eq sk(P, pk(P, M)) = M .\n\n  --- Asymmetric Encryption Property: An encrypted message is distinct from the original message.\n  --- This is an owise rule, applying if no other equation for pk(P,M) matches.\n  eq pk(P, M) =/= M [owise] .\n\n  --- XOR Algebraic Property: XORing an element (or set) with itself yields the null element.\n  eq xor(S, S) = nnsZero .\n  --- Note: Other XOR properties like xor(S, nnsZero) = S are handled by 'id: nnsZero'.\n  --- Associativity and commutativity are handled by 'assoc' and 'comm' attributes.\n\n  --- Strands\n  --- Each strand defines a sequence of message sends and receives for a principal's role.\n\n  --- Alice's strand:\n  --- 1.

All three cases (\"Bound Collector,\" \"Bound Stripper,\" \"Both Bound\") seem to describe scenarios where the function `h(Arg1, Arg2)` evaluates to `Arg2` if `Arg1` contains a `g(N)` (or `f(g(N),X)`) and `N` satisfies certain conditions.\n2.  The description for \"Bound Collector Case\" provides specific conditions for `N`.\n3.  For \"Bound Stripper Case\" and \"Both Bound Case,\" the conditions on `N` are not explicitly stated. I've made a reasonable assumption to assign them distinct ranges of `N` values that are not covered by the \"Bound Collector Case\" to make these cases distinguishable in the Maude code.

Maude-NPA can use such modules to define the equational theory governing messages.\n2.  **`protecting NAT .`**: This includes Maude's built-in `NAT` module, providing the sort `Nat` and operations like `+`, `*`, `>`, `<`, `==`, etc.\n3.  **`sorts Set . subsort Nat < Set .`**: Defines your custom sort `Set` and establishes `Nat` as a subsort of `Set`.\n4.  **`op f`, `op g`, `op h`**: Declare the operations as specified. `f` is marked `assoc comm` for associativity and commutativity.\n5.  **`vars ...`**: Declares variables used in the equations. I've used `CollectorVar` in the rules for `h` to make it clear that it represents the second argument which is \"collected\" or returned.\n6.  **`ceq ... if ... .`**: These are conditional equations. They define the behavior of `h`.\n    *   The conditions `(N > 10) or (N < 2) or (N == 5)` directly correspond to your \"Bound Collector Case.\"\n    *   The conditions `(N >= 2 and N < 5)` and `(N > 5 and N <= 10)` are my interpretations to make the \"Bound Stripper Case\" and \"Both Bound Case\" distinct rule sets based on the value of `N`. If the actual conditions are different (e.g., they overlap or depend on other properties not mentioned), these would need adjustment.\n7.  **Example Reductions**: The `red` commands are for testing this Maude module directly in Maude to see if the equations behave as expected.\n\nWhen using this with Maude-NPA for a protocol analysis where these terms might appear in messages, you would typically:\n*   Save this code as a `.maude` file (e.g., `acu-theory.maude`).\n*   In your Maude-NPA protocol specification file (often a `.npa` file or another `.maude` file that `includes MAUDE-NPA`), you would include this theory, for instance, by adding `(load acu-theory.maude)` or by wrapping this theory module directly in a `tomodule ... endtom` structure if Maude-NPA expects that for theories it directly processes for specific checks like variant narrowing.\n\nIf this module is intended to be the *entire* Maude-NPA input (e.g., for symbolic analysis directly on these terms rather than a cryptographic protocol), the structure might vary slightly, but the core equational definitions would remain the same.

Secrecy against \"honest but curious\" server:\n  ---    Add sk(s) to intruderKnowledge and check if da or db is revealed.\n  ---    Maude-NPA command: (search init =>* state such that (i learns da in state))\n  ---    (after modifying intruderKnowledge to include sk(s)).\n  ---\n  --- 3. The specific flaw: Computation with mixed keys.\n  ---    The attack occurs if Alice sends to the server a request of the form:\n  ---    s(< 'a, 'b, Na, Nb, pke(hpke(da, k(a,b)), pk(s)), pke(hpke(db, k(i,b)), pk(s)) >, sk(a))\n  ---    where 'da' is Alice's true secret and 'db' is Bob's true secret.\n  ---    Na is Alice's nonce for B. Nb is Bob's nonce generated in a session with 'i' (who replayed Na).\n  ---\n  ---    To detect this specific state, one could define an \"attack pattern\" strand (observer role)\n  ---    that receives this message. If this strand can complete, the attack state is reachable.\n  ---    Example observer for the message sent by Alice to the server:\n  ---\n  --- vars ObsNa ObsNb : Nonce .\n  --- strand flaw_observer ( ) :=\n  ---  [ - s(< a, b, ObsNa, ObsNb, pke(hpke(da, k(a,b)), pk(s)), pke(hpke(db, k(i,b)), pk(s)) >, sk(a)) ].\n  ---\n  --- If this strand is included and a trace is found, it demonstrates the flaw.\n  --- 'a', 'b', 'i', 's', 'da', 'db' must be treated as constants in this observer.\n\nendm\n\n--- Example Maude-NPA commands to be used in the Maude-NPA tool:\n--- (These commands are typically run within the Maude-NPA environment after loading the .maude file)\n\n--- To check secrecy of Alice's data 'da' (ensure 'da' is NOT in intruderKnowledge for this):\n--- red analyzeGoal(init, secrecy(da, {i}), 10) .\n--- or for newer Maude-NPA versions:\n--- red reduceInNPA(init, 'da, depth(10)) . search init =>* St such that intruder(St) learns 'da .\n\n--- To check for the specific attack pattern (message to server with mixed keys):\n--- You would add the flaw_observer strand (uncomment and ensure constants are correctly handled),\n--- then check if it's possible for this observer to receive the message.\n--- For example, by trying to see if a state containing this message in flight is reachable or if\n--- a \"dummy secret\" only present in that message can be \"learned\" by the observer.\n--- red analyzeGoal(init, canReach(flaw_observer( SartExprParamTuple )), 10). (Syntax varies)\n```\n\n**Key points in the Maude-NPA code:**\n\n1.  **Sorts and Subsorts**: Defines types like `Data`, `HKey` (Homomorphic Key), `HPKECt` (Homomorphic Ciphertext).\n2.  **Keys**:\n    *   `pk(P)`/`sk(P)`: Standard public/private keys for PKE and signatures.\n    *   `k(P1,P2)`: A symmetric shared key for homomorphic encryption between `P1` and `P2`. The `{comm}` attribute means `k(A,B)` is the same as `k(B,A)`.\n3.  **Operators**:\n    *   `pke`/`pdk`: Regular public-key encryption/decryption.\n    *   `hpke`/`hpdk`: Homomorphic encryption/decryption.\n    *   `s`: Digital signature.\n    *   `f`: The homomorphic function applied by the server to ciphertexts.\n    *   `<_,_,...>`: Tuple constructor for message parts (implicit in Maude-NPA syntax for `s(...)`).\n4.  **Equations**: Define how decryption reverses encryption for both PKE and HPKE.\n5.  **Strands**:\n    *   `alice`: Models Alice's role as the initiator.\n    *   `bob`: Models Bob's role as the responder. Note that Bob interacts with a principal `Aprime`, which could be Alice or the Intruder. This is crucial for the flaw.\n    *   `server`: Models the server's operations: receiving encrypted data, applying function `f`, and sending back the result.\n6.  **Intruder Setup**:\n    *   The intruder `i` knows its own keys and all public keys.\n    *   `k(i,P)`: The intruder can establish/know its own HPKE keys with any other principal `P`.\n    *   **Important for Secrecy Checks**: The `da` and `db` should *not* be in `intruderKnowledge` if you are checking for their secrecy. I've added a note about this. For the flaw description, `dfake` is more relevant for the intruder to inject.\n7.  **Security Goals/Flaw**:\n    *   Standard secrecy of `da` and `db` can be checked.\n    *   The \"honest but curious server\" check would involve giving `sk(s)` to the intruder.\n    *   The specific flaw you described involves the server receiving a message from Alice where her data `hpke(da, k(a,b))` is paired with Bob's data that was created using a different key context, `hpke(db, k(i,b))`. This happens due to the intruder's manipulation. I've included a commented-out `flaw_observer` strand concept as one way to detect this specific attack state.\n\n**To use this code with Maude-NPA:**\n\n1.  Save it as a `.maude` file (e.g., `protocol.maude`).\n2.  Load it into Maude with the Maude-NPA tool.\n3.  Use Maude-NPA commands to search for attacks (e.g., violations of secrecy for `da` or `db`, or reachability of the flawed state). The exact commands might vary slightly based on your Maude-NPA version.\n\nThis model should provide a good starting point for analyzing your protocol and formally demonstrating the described flaw. Remember to adjust `intruderKnowledge` based on the specific property you are verifying (e.g., remove `da`, `db` for secrecy checks, add `sk(s)` for server curiosity checks)."]],

It imports `ProtocolTransitionSystem` (or a similar base module provided by your Maude-NPA environment, often just `MAUDE-NPA` or `PROTOCOL`).\n    *   `NONCE-AUTH-SECRECY-ALICE-NONCE-ATTACK`, etc.: Example modules for specifying attack states. They import the protocol specification.\n\n2.  **Sorts and Subsorts:**\n    *   `Agent`, `Nonce`, `Key`, `PriKey`, `PubKey` are defined.\n    *   `Fresh < Nonce`: Freshly generated nonces are a subsort of `Nonce`.\n    *   `Agent`, `Nonce`, `Key` are subsorts of `Msg` (message).\n\n3.  **Operators (Constructors):**\n    *   `a`, `b`, `i`: Agents Alice, Bob, and Intruder.\n    *   `pk(Agent)`, `sk(Agent)`: Public and private key functions.\n    *   `na-placeholder`, `nb-placeholder`: Constants of sort `Nonce`. These are used in role signatures when a nonce value is not yet known by that principal for that parameter. This helps maintain a consistent role signature across states.\n    *   `_,_`: Message concatenation (associative, commutative, with `null` as identity).\n    *   `enc(Msg, Key)`: Encryption. Note that `Key` is used here, but in rules, `pk(Target)` ensures it's a public key.\n    *   `dec(Msg, Key)`: Decryption function (used in equations, not message construction).\n\n4.  **Variables:** Standard Maude variable declarations for use in rules and equations. `NAfr`, `NBfr` are of sort `Fresh`.\n\n5.  **Equations:**\n    *   `dec(enc(M, pk(Target)), sk(Target)) = M .`: The fundamental decryption equation.\n\n6.  **Role Definitions:**\n    *   `op alice : Agent Agent Nonce Nonce -> Role .`: `alice(Self, Peer, MyNonceSent, PeerNonceReceived)`\n    *   `op bob : Agent Agent Nonce Nonce -> Role .`: `bob(Self, Peer, PeerNonceReceived, MyNonceSent)`\n    *   The nonces in the role signature store the nonces relevant to that principal's view of the session. Placeholders are used initially if the nonce is learned later.\n\n7.  **Initial State:**\n    *   `initialStrands`: Defines the initial setup. Alice (`'a'`) intends to talk to Bob (`'b'`), generating `NAfr`. Bob (`'b'`) expects to talk to Alice (`'a'`), generating `NBfr`.\n    *   `initialIntruderKnowledge`: What the intruder knows at the beginning (itself, public keys, identities of honest agents, its own private key, and any public constants like placeholders).\n\n8.  **Protocol Rules (`rl`):**\n    *   Each rule describes a state transition for a principal's strand.\n    *   `strand(role(...), stateIn)`: The current state of the strand.\n    *   `msg(Sender, Receiver, Content)`: A message on the network.\n    *   `=>`: Rewrites to...\n    *   `strand(role(...), stateOut)`: The new state of the strand.\n    *   `MyNa`, `TheirNa`, etc. in roles are bound to the actual nonces (freshly generated like `NAfr` or received like `Narecv`) as the protocol progresses.\n    *   Matching: When a message `enc((MyNa, Nbrecv, B), pk(A))` is received by Alice in `Alice-2-Receive`, `MyNa` in the message *must* match the `MyNa` Alice has stored in her role state (which was the one she sent). `Nbrecv` is a new variable bound to the received nonce.\n\n9.  **Attack State Modules:**\n    *   These define specific security properties to check.\n    *   **Secrecy:** `goal = iknows(NAFRfresh) .` asks if the intruder can ever learn the nonce `NAFRfresh` that Alice generated. The `initialStrandsWithGoalNonce(NAFRfresh)` construct helps ensure `NAFRfresh` in the goal refers to the specific nonce from Alice's initial strand.\n    *   **Authentication:** The authentication example `NONCE-AUTH-AUTHENTICATION-AtoB-ATTACK` shows how one might start thinking about authentication. Proving authentication often involves more complex properties (e.g., using claims within roles or temporal logic) than simple reachability of a \"bad\" state, or it involves checking for the absence of specific impersonation attacks. The provided example `bobCompletesWithAlice` is a simple reachability goal to find instances where Bob completes the protocol thinking he is talking to Alice. Analyzing the trace would be necessary to confirm if Alice was genuinely participating.\n\n**To use this with Maude-NPA:**\n\n1.  Save the code (likely splitting the `SPEC` and `ATTACK` modules into different files or keeping them together).\n2.  Ensure you have Maude and Maude-NPA installed and configured.\n3.  Load the appropriate base Maude-NPA theory (e.g., `prot-realtime.maude`, `prot-common.maude`, or whatever `ProtocolTransitionSystem` is defined in for your setup).\n4.  Load your protocol specification file.\n5.  Use Maude-NPA's search commands (e.g., `search < initialStrands | initialIntruderKnowledge | goal > =>! ST .`) or specific commands like `analyze(attackState)` if your Maude-NPA version has higher-level analysis functions.\n\nThis code provides a solid foundation for analyzing your nonce-based authentication protocol with Maude-NPA. Remember to adapt the `procol` import to match your Maude-NPA environment."]], "MAUDE-1/Kao-Chow_Repeated_Authentication.maude": [[true, "---- The Kao Chow Repeated Authentication Protocol\n\nfmod KAOCHEW-PROTOCOL-SYMBOLS is\n  protecting DEFINITION-PROTOCOL-RULES .\n\n  -- Sort Information\n  sorts  UName SName Name Key Nonce Masterkey Sessionkey .\n  subsort Name Nonce Key < Msg .\n  subsort Masterkey Sessionkey < Key .\n  subsort SName UName < Name .\n  subsort Name < Public .\n\n  -- Nonce operator\n  op n : Name Fresh -> Nonce [frozen] .\n  -- Removed op t : Name Fresh -> Nonce [frozen] . as it was unused.\n\n  -- User names\n  ops a b : -> UName .\n\n  -- Server name\n  op s : ->  SName .\n\n  -- Master key\n  op mkey : Name Name -> Masterkey [frozen] .\n\n  -- Session key\n  op seskey : Name Name Nonce -> Sessionkey [frozen] .\n\n  -- Encryption and Decryption\n  op e : Key Msg -> Msg [frozen] .\n  op d : Key Msg -> Msg [frozen] .\n\n  -- Concatenation\n  op _;_ : Msg Msg -> Msg [frozen gather (e E)] .\n\nendfm\n\nfmod KAOCHEW-PROTOCOL-ALGEBRAIC is\n  protecting KAOCHEW-PROTOCOL-SYMBOLS .\n\n  eq d(K:Key, e(K:Key, Z:Msg)) = Z:Msg [variant] .\n  eq e(K:Key, d(K:Key, Z:Msg)) = Z:Msg [variant] .\n\nendfm\n\nfmod KAOCHEW-PROTOCOL-SPECIFICATION is\n  protecting KAOCHEW-PROTOCOL-SYMBOLS .\n  protecting DEFINITION-PROTOCOL-RULES .\n  protecting DEFINITION-CONSTRAINTS-INPUT .\n\n  vars A B : UName .  -- Alice and Bob's identities\n  var r : Fresh .     -- Fresh value for nonce generation\n  vars NA NB : Nonce . -- Variables to bind Alice's and Bob's nonces in patterns\n  var SK : Sessionkey . -- Variable to bind the Session Key in patterns\n\n  eq STRANDS-PROTOCOL =\n    -- Alice's Role\n    -- A is Alice, B is Bob.\n    -- r is a fresh value for Alice's nonce n(A,r).\n    -- SK will be bound to the session key received from the server.\n    -- NB will be bound to Bob's nonce received from Bob.\n    :: r ::\n    [ nil | +(e(mkey(A,s), A ; B ; n(A,r))),                                           --- 1.

(Corrected from plaintext send).\n        *   Step 2: Receives the concatenated message from the server: `e(mkey(A,s), A ; B ; n(A,r) ; SK) ; e(mkey(B,s), A ; B ; n(A,r) ; SK)`. Here, `n(A,r)` is her original nonce which she can check, and `SK` is the session key she learns.\n        *   Step 3: Sends Bob's part of the message `e(mkey(B,s), A ; B ; n(A,r) ; SK)` to Bob.\n        *   Step 4: Receives `e(SK, NB)` from Bob, where `NB` is Bob's nonce. The strand ends here as Alice verifies Bob.\n    *   **Bob's Strand**:\n        *   Step 1: Receives `e(mkey(B,s), A ; B ; NA ; SK)` from Alice. `NA` is Alice's nonce, `SK` is the session key. (Corrected from receiving an additional `MA` prefix).\n        *   Step 2: Sends `e(SK, n(B,r))` to Alice, where `n(B,r)` is his newly generated nonce. The strand ends here.\n    *   **Server's Strand**:\n        *   Step 1: Receives `e(mkey(A,s), A ; B ; NA)` from Alice. (Corrected from receiving plaintext).\n        *   Step 2: Sends the concatenated message `e(mkey(A,s), A ; B ; NA ; seskey(A,B,n(s,r))) ; e(mkey(B,s), A ; B ; NA ; seskey(A,B,n(s,r))))`. `seskey(A,B,n(s,r))` is the generated session key.\n\nThe use of `:: r ::` for each role definition means `r` acts as a formal parameter for providing freshness to nonces unique to that strand instance (e.g., `n(A,r)` for Alice, `n(B,r)` for Bob, `n(s,r)` for the server's key generation). Maude-NPA will instantiate `r` with distinct fresh constants for different strands in an execution trace.\n\nThis revised specification should correctly model the protocol you described. The attack states you mentioned (Session Key Discovery, False Authentication) can be formulated as security goals when you run Maude-NPA with this specification."]], "MAUDE-1/Kao-Chow_Repeated_Authentication_Handshake_Key.maude": [[true, "(prot KaoChowRepeatedAuth\n  (types\n    Name Key Nonce Fresh Msg MId\n  endtypes)\n\n  (subsorts\n    Name Key Nonce Fresh < Msg\n  endsubsorts)\n\n  (ops\n    a b s i : -> Name --- Principals: Alice, Bob, Server, Intruder\n    k : Name Name -> Key --- Master key: k(Owner, Server)\n    sk : Fresh -> Key --- Session key generated from a Fresh value\n\n    n : Name Fresh -> Nonce --- Nonce: n(Owner, FreshValue)\n\n    msg1 msg2 msg3 msg4 msg5 : -> MId --- Message identifiers for GUI\n\n    _._ : Msg Msg -> Msg [assoc id: null] --- Message concatenation\n    e : Key Msg -> Msg --- Symmetric encryption\n    --- d (decryption) is implicitly defined by Maude-NPA via equations\n  endops)\n\n  (vars\n    A B S User Serv : Name\n    Na Nb NaMsg NbMsg : Nonce\n    Kab SessKey : Key\n    Ticket TicketB : Msg\n    M M1 M2 : Msg\n    NaF NbF KabF : Fresh --- Fresh values for generating nonces/keys\n  endvars)\n\n  (eqs --- Cryptographic properties\n    eq d(K:Key, e(K, M:Msg)) = M .\n    --- eq d(K:Key, M:Msg) = M [owise] . --- Optional: defines decryption failure\n  endeqs)\n\n  (generate_fresh_for_role --- Specifies which variables in roles are freshly generated\n    initiator NaF .\n    responder NbF .\n    server KabF .\n  endgenerate_fresh_for_role)\n\n  (roles\n\n    (role initiator --- Alice's role\n      (vars A B S : Name, NaF : Fresh, NbMsgRcvd : Nonce, SessKeyRcvd : Key, TicketBRcvd : Msg)\n      (uniq NaF) --- NaF must be fresh for each run of this role\n      (trace\n        (send msg1(A, S, (A .

the following message exchanges:\n\n1.  **Alice -> Server**: `e(mkey(A,S), (A, B, Na))`\n    *   Alice initiates contact with the server, sending her identity, Bob's identity, and a fresh nonce `Na`, all encrypted with her master key shared with the server.\n\n2.  **Server -> Alice**: `e(mkey(A,S), (Na, B, Kab, Kt))`\n    *   The server generates a session key `Kab` and a nonce `Kt`.\n    *   It responds to Alice with `Na` (for her to verify), Bob's identity `B`, the session key `Kab`, and its nonce `Kt`, encrypted with Alice's master key.\n\n3.  **Server -> Bob**: `e(mkey(B,S), (A, Kab, Kt))`\n    *   The server also sends a message to Bob, containing Alice's identity `A`, the session key `Kab`, and its nonce `Kt`, encrypted with Bob's master key.\n\n4.  **Bob -> Alice**: `e(Kab, (Kt, Nb))`\n    *   Bob decrypts the message from the server, learns `Kab` and `Kt`.\n    *   He generates his own nonce `Nb`.\n    *   He sends `Kt` (received from the server) and his nonce `Nb` to Alice, encrypted with the new session key `Kab`.\n\n5.  **Alice (Final Acknowledgment)**:\n    *   Alice decrypts Bob's message using `Kab`.\n    *   She verifies `Kt` (which she also received from the server). If it matches, she authenticates Bob and confirms the session key `Kab`. Both `Kab` and `Nb` are now known to her.\n\nHere's the Maude-NPA code representing this protocol:\n\n```maude\n(fmod KAO-CHOW-REPEATED-AUTH-PROTOCOL is\n    protecting MAUDE-NPA .\n\n    --- Sorts definition\n    sorts Name Nonce Key SKey MKey Fresh Crypt .\n    subsort Name Nonce Key < Msg .\n    subsort SKey MKey < Key .\n\n    --- Operations for constructing messages\n    --- Principals (Alice, Bob, Server)\n    ops a b s : -> Name [ctor] .\n\n    --- Nonce generation: n(PrincipalWhoGeneratedIt, FreshValue)\n    op n : Name Fresh -> Nonce [ctor] .\n\n    --- Master key shared between two principals\n    op mkey : Name Name -> MKey [ctor] .\n\n    --- Session key for A and B, generated based on a nonce Ns from Server\n    op seskey : Name Name Nonce -> SKey [ctor] .\n\n    --- Message concatenation\n    op '_,_ : Msg Msg -> Msg [ctor assoc id: null] .\n\n    --- Encryption and decryption\n    op e : Key Msg -> Crypt [ctor] .\n    op d : Key Crypt -> Msg .\n    eq d(K,e(K,M)) = M .\n\n    --- Variables used in strands\n    vars A B SName : Name .\n    vars Na Nb Kt Ns : Nonce .\n    vars K_ : Key . --- Generic key variable\n    vars KAB_ : SKey . --- Session key variable\n    vars MKEYAS MKEYBS : MKey . --- Master key variables\n    vars M : Msg .\n    vars Rna Rnb Rkt Rns : Fresh . --- Fresh value variables for nonce generation\n\n    --- Strand for Alice's role\n    --- Parameters: A (Alice's Name), B (Bob's Name), SName (Server's Name),\n    ---             MKEYAS (Alice's master key with Server), Rna (Fresh value for Na)\n    str alice (A Name, B Name, SName Name, MKEYAS MKey, Rna Fresh)\n        local Na Nonce, Nb Nonce, Kt Nonce, KAB_ SKey .\n        1: Na := n(A,Rna)                                       --- Alice generates Na\n        2: out(e(MKEYAS,(A,B,Na)))                              --- Msg 1: A -> S\n        3: in(e(MKEYAS,(Na,B,KAB_,Kt)))                         --- Msg 2: S -> A (Alice receives Kab, Kt;

The second message `B --> A: A ; B ; exp(g, N_A)` being an echo of (part of) the first message is a bit unusual if `N_B` is supposed to be a fresh nonce from B that A needs to learn.\n\nGiven the literal description:\n1.  `A --> B: A ; B ; exp(g, N_A)`\n2.  `B --> A: A ; B ; exp(g, N_A)`\n3.  `A --> B: enc(exp(exp(g, N_B), N_A), sec(A, B))`\n\nFor A to compute `exp(exp(g, N_B), N_A)`, A must know `exp(g, N_B)`. Since B does not send this value in message 2 (it only echoes `exp(g, N_A)`), `exp(g, N_B)` must be a pre-established (e.g., static public) value for B known to A. Thus, `N_B` would be B's corresponding static private exponent.\n\nFor B to decrypt, it needs to compute `exp(exp(g, N_A), N_B)` (which is equal to `exp(exp(g, N_B), N_A)` due to the algebraic property `exp(exp(X,Y),Z) = exp(X,Y*Z)` and commutativity of multiplication `Y*Z = Z*Y`). B learns `exp(g, N_A)` from message 1 and uses its own private exponent `N_B`.\n\nThe shared secret `sec(A, B)` is treated as the confidential payload.\n\nHere's the Maude-NPA code:\n\n```maude\nselect MAUDE-NPA .\nset-output M\u0101udeNPA/output/sample.maude .\n\n(fmod PROTOCOL-ALGEBRA is\n  pr STRING .\n  pr NAT .\n\n  sorts Msg Prin Nonce Key Const .\n  subsort Prin < Msg .\n  subsort Nonce < Msg .\n  subsort Key < Msg .\n  subsort Const < Msg .\n\n  op A B i : -> Prin [ctor] .\n  op g : -> Const [ctor] .\n\n  op sec : Prin Prin -> Msg [ctor] .\n  op privExp : Prin -> Nonce [ctor] . --- Represents N_A, N_B if they are private exponents\n\n  --- Concatenation of messages\n  op _;_ : Msg Msg -> Msg [ctor assoc id: null prec 50] .\n\n  --- Cryptographic operations\n  op exp : Msg Nonce -> Msg [ctor prec 45] . --- exp(base, exponent)\n  op enc : Msg Msg -> Msg [ctor prec 45] .   --- enc(key, plaintext)\n  op d : Msg Msg -> Msg [ctor prec 45] .     --- d(key, ciphertext)\n\n  --- Multiplication for exponents (commutative)\n  op _*_ : Nonce Nonce -> Nonce [ctor assoc comm prec 40] .\n\n  vars P P1 P2 : Prin .\n  vars M M1 M2 : Msg .\n  vars K : Key . --- Though exp returns Msg, it's used as a key\n  vars X Y Z : Msg . --- For generic algebraic properties\n  vars N Na Nb Np : Nonce .\n\n  eq enc(K, d(K, M)) = M .\n  eq d(K, enc(K, M)) = M .\n\n  --- exp(exp(X,Y),Z) = exp(X, Y*Z)\n  --- Assuming X is always 'g' for the DH-like key exchange part:\n  --- K_A = exp(exp(g, Nb), Na) = exp(g, Nb*Na)\n  --- K_B = exp(exp(g, Na), Nb) = exp(g, Na*Nb)\n  --- The property exp(exp(Base, Exp1), Exp2) = exp(Base, Exp1 * Exp2) is critical.\n  eq exp(exp(X, Y), Z) = exp(X, (Y * Z)) .\n\nendfm)\n\n(fmod PROTOCOL-STRANDS is\n  pr PROTOCOL-ALGEBRA .\n\n  vars Alice Bob : Prin .\n  vars Na NbSess : Nonce . --- Na is A's session nonce, NbSess is B's static private exponent\n  vars ExpGNa ExpGNbSess : Msg . --- ExpGNbSess is B's static public value exp(g, NbSess)\n  vars SecAB : Msg . --- The shared secret payload sec(Alice, Bob)\n\n  --- Strand for Alice (Initiator)\n  --- Alice knows Bob's static public value ExpGNbSess = exp(g, privExp(Bob))\n  --- Alice generates fresh Na\n  --- Alice computes key K = exp(ExpGNbSess, Na)\n  ( strand roleA (Alice, Bob, ExpGNbSess, SecAB, g) : 3 steps\n    (\n      fresh Na : Nonce .\n      1: send(Alice ; Bob ; exp(g, Na)) .\n      2: recv(Alice ; Bob ; exp(g, Na)) . --- Echo from Bob\n      3: send(enc(exp(ExpGNbSess, Na), SecAB)) .\n    )\n  )\n\n  --- Strand for Bob (Responder)\n  --- Bob knows its own static private exponent NbSess = privExp(Bob)\n  --- Bob receives ExpGNa = exp(g, Na) from Alice\n  --- Bob computes key K = exp(ExpGNa, NbSess)\n  ( strand roleB (Alice, Bob, NbSess, SecAB, g) : 3 steps\n    (\n      1: recv(Alice ; Bob ; ExpGNa) .\n      2: send(Alice ; Bob ; ExpGNa) . --- Echo back\n      3: recv(enc(exp(ExpGNa, NbSess), SecAB)) .\n    )\n  )\nendfm)\n\n(fmod PROTOCOL-MAIN is\n  pr PROTOCOL-STRANDS .\n\n  --- Initial state:\n  --- Intruder knows principals, generator g.\n  --- Intruder knows its own private exponent.\n  --- Intruder knows Bob's public value exp(g, privExp(B)) (standard assumption for public keys).\n  --- Alice and Bob share sec(A,B), which is secret from the intruder.\n  ( state initialP (\n      --- Instance of Alice's role\n      roleA(A, B, exp(g, privExp(B)), sec(A,B), g)\n      --- Instance of Bob's role\n      ||| roleB(A, B, privExp(B), sec(A,B), g)\n\n      --- Intruder knowledge\n      iknows(A) iknows(B) iknows(i) iknows(g)\n      iknows(privExp(i)) --- Intruder's own private exponent\n      iknows(exp(g, privExp(B))) --- Intruder knows B's public value\n      --- Note: sec(A,B) is not in iknows, hence it's initially secret.\n      --- We also assume privExp(B) is secret (only B knows it).\n    )\n  )\n\n  --- Attack Pattern: Secrecy of sec(A,B)\n  --- The protocol aims to protect sec(A,B).

So, `N_B` from the description is `privExp(B)`. `N_A` is a fresh nonce generated by A for the session.\n2.  **`ExpGNbSess`**: In Alice's role, this variable represents `exp(g, privExp(B))`, which is B's static public value that Alice must know beforehand.\n3.  **`SecAB`**: This is `sec(Alice, Bob)`, the payload being encrypted.\n4.  **Symmetry of Key Derivation**:\n    *   Alice computes key: `exp(ExpGNbSess, Na)` which is `exp(exp(g, privExp(B)), Na)`.\n    *   Bob computes key: `exp(ExpGNa, NbSess)` which is `exp(exp(g, Na), privExp(B))`.\n    *   These are equal if `exp(exp(Base, E1), E2) = exp(Base, E1 * E2)` and multiplication `*` is commutative. This is captured by `eq exp(exp(X, Y), Z) = exp(X, (Y * Z)) .` and `op _*_ : Nonce Nonce -> Nonce [ctor assoc comm] .`.\n5.  **Initial Intruder Knowledge**: The intruder `i` knows B's public value `exp(g, privExp(B))` but not `privExp(B)` itself, nor `sec(A,B)`.\n6.  **Attack State**: The primary goal demonstrated is the secrecy of `sec(A,B)`. If Maude-NPA finds a path to `iknows(sec(A,B))`, the protocol fails this secrecy goal.\n\nThis model reflects the protocol as literally described, under the interpretation that `N_B` relates to a static key pair for B. If `N_B` were intended to be a fresh nonce from B for the session, message 2 would need to be different (e.g., B sending `exp(g, N_B)` to A)."]], "MAUDE-1/Needham_Schroeder.maude": [[true, "(fmod SECURE-MESSAGE-EXCHANGE-PROTOCOL is\n  protecting MAUDE-NPA .\n\n  --- Sorts for principals, nonces, and messages\n  sorts Pri Nonce .\n  subsort Pri < Msg .\n  subsort Nonce < Msg .\n\n  --- Example principal constants (actual principals in strands will be variables)\n  --- ops alice bob intruder : -> Pri . --- Lowercase typically used for constants if needed globally\n\n  --- Message concatenation operator\n  --- prec 50 means it binds tighter than pk/sk (prec 55)\n  op _;_ : Msg Msg -> Msg [assoc id: null prec 50 gather (e E)] .\n\n  --- Encryption operators\n  --- pk(P, M): Message M encrypted with public key of principal P\n  --- sk(P, M): Message M encrypted with private key of principal P\n  --- prec 55 means they bind less tightly than concatenation\n  op pk : Pri Msg -> Msg [prec 55] .\n  op sk : Pri Msg -> Msg [prec 55] .\n\n  --- Variables for equations and strand definitions\n  vars P K : Pri .        --- Variables for principals\n  vars N Na Nb : Nonce .  --- Variables for nonces\n  vars M M' : Msg .       --- Variables for messages\n\n  --- Algebraic properties (Equations for encryption/decryption)\n  --- 1.

Maude-NPA's default algebra usually provides `_,_ : Data Data -> Data [ctor assoc comm id: null]`. If your Maude-NPA version handles this differently, you might need to adjust. The items being concatenated (`Na`, `A`, `Nb`, `B`) are all of `Data` sort due to `Agent, Nonce < Data`. The result of concatenation is also `Data`, which is then encrypted using `aenc`.\n5.  **Operators `pk`, `aenc`**:\n    *   `pk(Agent)`: Represents the public key of an agent.\n    *   `aenc(Data, PKey)`: Represents asymmetric encryption of data with a public key.\n    These are assumed to be provided by `MAUDE-NPA`.\n6.  **Roles `ALICE` and `BOB`**:\n    *   The parameters `(A B : Agent, Na : Nonce, Nb : Nonce)` define the \"inputs\" to the role. `A` and `B` are the agents involved, `Na` and `Nb` are the nonces.\n    *   `fresh Na` (for ALICE) and `fresh Nb` (for BOB) declare that the respective nonce is generated by that role instance and must be unique. Nonces not marked `fresh` (like `Nb` in ALICE's parameters, and `Na` in BOB's) are variables that will be instantiated by messages received during the protocol execution.\n    *   `def [...]`: Defines the sequence of messages sent (`out`) and received (`in`) by the role.\n    *   Message structure: For example, `aenc((Na, A), pk(B))` represents the message `(Na, A)` encrypted with `B`'s public key. `(Na,A)` is the concatenation of nonce `Na` and agent identity `A`.\n7.  **Homomorphic Encryption**: The informal description mentions \"public key encryption (PK) is homomorphic over concatenation\". In this Maude-NPA formalization, this is interpreted as encrypting already concatenated data (e.g., `aenc((Na, A), pk(B))`). If the homomorphic property implies algebraic properties on ciphertexts (e.g., `aenc(M1, K) * aenc(M2, K) = aenc((M1,M2), K)`), then additional equations would be needed in the algebra. The current formalization uses the standard \"black-box\" model for `aenc` unless such equations are added. The protocol steps as written are consistent with encrypting concatenated data.\n\nTo use this specification, you would typically load it into Maude-NPA and then define an initial state (e.g., Alice `a` initiating with Bob `b`) and specify security properties to check (e.g., secrecy of nonces, authentication)."]], "MAUDE-1/Needham_Schroeder_Lowe_Modified.maude": [[true, "(fmod LOWE-XOR-ATTACK is\n  pr META-INTERPRETER .\n  pr SIGNATURE .\n\n  sorts PId Fresh Msg .\n  subsort PId Fresh < Msg .\n\n  op a b i : -> PId . --- Constants for Alice, Bob, Intruder\n  op '0 : -> Msg .    --- Constant for XOR identity\n\n  --- Message constructors\n  op pk : PId Msg -> Msg . --- pk(Key, Message)\n  op sk : PId Msg -> Msg . --- sk(Key, Message) (for equational properties)\n  op _,_ : Msg Msg -> Msg [assoc comm gather (e E)] . --- Concatenation (Maude-NPA uses juxtaposition by default, but explicit op is fine)\n  op _*_ : Msg Msg -> Msg [assoc comm] . --- Exclusive OR\n\n  vars M M' K : Msg .\n  vars P : PId .\n  vars X Y Z : Msg .\n\n  --- Cryptographic equations (decryption undoes encryption)\n  eq pk(P, sk(P, M)) = M .\n  eq sk(P, pk(P, M)) = M .\n\n  --- XOR algebraic properties\n  eq X * X = '0 .\n  eq X * X * Y = Y . --- This implies '0 * Y = Y\n  eq X * '0 = X .\n  --- Note: X*X*Y = Y and X*'0 = X together imply X*X='0.\n  --- If Y = '0, then X*X*'0 = '0.

Maude-NPA often uses simple juxtaposition `Msg Msg`, but an explicit operator helps. I've used `(M1, M2)` style tuple for concatenation.\n    *   `_*_`: Exclusive OR, declared associative and commutative.\n4.  **Equations**:\n    *   Standard encryption/decryption cancellation.\n    *   XOR properties as specified: `X * X = '0`, `X * X * Y = Y`, `X * '0 = X`.\n5.  **Protocol Roles (`rl`)**:\n    *   **`alice` role**: Defined in two rules, `alice-1` for the first message and `alice-2` for the second and third messages.\n        *   `A_`, `B_`: Alice's and Bob's identifiers.\n        *   `NA`: Alice's fresh nonce.\n        *   `NB`: The nonce Alice believes Bob is using. This is `Msg` because it can be a manipulated value like `'0`.\n        *   `fr(NA)`: Declares `NA` as a fresh value for this strand.\n        *   `out(msg)`: Message sent.\n        *   `in(msg)`: Message received.\n        *   `\u77e5\u9053\u4e86(...)` are informal markers to indicate the point in the protocol; they don't have formal meaning for Maude-NPA's core search but can be useful.\n    *   **`bob` role**: Defined similarly.\n        *   `NBfresh`: Bob's own fresh nonce (type `Fresh`). Bob expects this exact nonce back in the third message.\n6.  **Intruder Setup**:\n    *   `attacker = i`: Declares `i` as the intruder.\n    *   `honestPrincipals = (a ; b)`: Declares `a` and `b` as honest.\n7.  **Attack State (`goal`)**:\n    *   This describes the state of the system that represents a successful attack.\n    *   The attack aims to trick Alice (`a`) into believing that Bob's (`b`) nonce is `'0`.\n    *   **`[alice(a, b, NAparam, '0), ...]`**: This part of the state signifies that an Alice strand (with `a` as Alice, `b` as Bob, `NAparam` as her nonce) has completed, and her `NB` variable (representing Bob's nonce) has become `'0`. She has sent her final message `pk(b, '0')`.\n    *   **`[alice(a, i, NAparam, NBdummy), ...]`**: This part models the Lowe-style setup. Alice (`a`) initiates a session with the intruder (`i`) using the *same nonce* `NAparam`. This strand only executes its first step (`out(pk(i, (NAparam, a)))`). The intruder `i` can decrypt this message using `sk(i)` and thus learn `NAparam`.\n    *   The Maude-NPA tool will search for a sequence of operations (protocol steps, intruder actions) that can lead to this state. If found, the attack is possible.\n    *   The specific XOR manipulation here is that the intruder, after learning `NAparam`, crafts the message `pk(a, (NAparam, b))` and sends it to Alice in her session with `b`. Alice receives `(NAparam, b)`. She expects the second component to be `b * NB_from_Bob`. So, `b = b * NB_from_Bob`. XORing `b` to both sides: `b*b = b*b*NB_from_Bob` which simplifies to `'0 = '0*NB_from_Bob`, so `'0 = NB_from_Bob`. Thus, Alice accepts `'0` as Bob's nonce.\n\nTo run this analysis, you would typically load this file into Maude with Maude-NPA and execute a command like:\n`red npa(goal, initial-state, KNOWLEDGE_TYPE) .`\n(The exact command might vary based on your Maude-NPA version and desired search strategy/type).\n\nThis Maude code provides a formal basis for analyzing the described vulnerability in the protocol."]], "MAUDE-1/ascentFunctionsJanuary2020.maude": [[true, "--- Test Protocol for Non-Existent Module Handling in Maude\n--- This file defines a module 'BAD' that attempts to import a non-existent module.\n--- It then uses meta-level reductions to demonstrate that the contents of 'BAD'\n--- cannot be effectively accessed.\n\n--- The module 'NON-EXISTENT' is intentionally NOT DEFINED anywhere.\n--- This is crucial for the test.\n\nfmod BAD is\n  pr NON-EXISTENT . --- 'BAD' attempts to protect 'NON-EXISTENT', which does not exist.\nendfm\n\n--- Meta-Level Reductions\n--- These commands attempt to pull up various components of the 'BAD' module.\n\n--- 1. upModule('BAD, false): Attempts to promote the BAD module to the metalevel.\n--- Expected: Maude will return a representation of BAD, showing its dependency\n--- on an 'unknown-module' (NON-EXISTENT).

Then, we will use Maude's meta-level functions (`upModule`, `upSorts`, etc.) to try to inspect `BAD`.\n\nMaude is generally robust:\n1.  It will likely load the `BAD` module but will issue a warning that `NON-EXISTENT` cannot be found.\n2.  When `upModule('BAD, false)` is called, it will return a meta-representation of the `BAD` module, which will likely show that it tries to protect an `unknown-module`.\n3.  Subsequent calls like `upSorts('BAD, false)`, `upOpDecls('BAD, false)`, etc., will return `none` (Maude's representation for an empty set of the respective meta-level elements), because `BAD` has no actual content due to the failed import and no other definitions of its own.\n4.

Use Maude-NPA search commands.", "Okay, I can help you generate the Maude-NPA code for the Secure Communication Protocol you've described.\n\nBased on your description, here's how the protocol elements are typically mapped to Maude-NPA:\n\n1.  **Participants (Agents)**: `S`, `A`, `B`, `i` will be of sort `Agent`.\n2.  **Nonces**: `N_A`, `N_S`, `N_B` will be of sort `Nonce`, which is a subsort of `Fresh` (meaning they are generated uniquely for each session).\n3.  **Key Usage**:\n    *   `sk(x, y)` (message `y` encrypted with the private key of `x`): This is typically modeled as a signature, `senc(y, privK(x))`. The content `y` is not confidential from anyone who knows `pubK(x)`.\n    *   `pk(K, M)` (message `M` encrypted with public key `K`): This is modeled as asymmetric encryption, `aenc(M, pubK(K))`. This provides confidentiality; only the owner of `privK(K)` can decrypt `M`. This operation is mentioned in your properties but not directly in the message flow.\n4.  **Message Concatenation `X ; Y`**: This is represented by the `_;_` operator in Maude-NPA, which is associative. The \"bounded to depth of 3\" aspect is typically an analytical consideration or a constraint on specific instances, rather than a syntactic property of the operator itself in Maude.\n5.  **Encryption Properties**:\n    *   `pk(K, sk(K, M)) = M`: This means a message signed with `privK(K)` (i.e., `senc(M, privK(K))`) can be verified using `pubK(K)` to retrieve `M`. Maude-NPA's intruder can do this as public keys are public.\n    *   `sk(K, pk(K, M)) = M`: This means a message encrypted with `pubK(K)` (i.e., `aenc(M, pubK(K))`) can be decrypted using `privK(K)` to retrieve `M`. Maude-NPA's intruder can do this if it possesses `privK(K)` (e.g., if `K` is the intruder `i`, or `K` is compromised).\n    These properties are inherent in Maude-NPA's model of `senc`/`aenc` and `pubK`/`privK`.\n6.  **Message Flow**:\n    1.  `S -> A: N_S`\n        *   Server `S` sends `N_S`.\n    2.  `A -> B: sk(A, N_S ; S)`\n        *   Initiator `A` receives `N_S`, then sends `senc((N_S ; S), privK(A))` to `B`.\n    3.  `A -> B: sk(A, B ; N_A ; S)`\n        *   Initiator `A` generates fresh `N_A`, then sends `senc((B ; N_A ; S), privK(A))` to `B`.\n\n**Important Note on Secrecy**: Given that `sk(X, Y)` is modeled as `senc(Y, privK(X))`, the message content `Y` is *not* confidential from an eavesdropper who knows `pubK(X)` (which is generally public). Therefore, nonces `N_S` (in message 2) and `N_A` (in message 3) will not be secret from the intruder in this formulation. If confidentiality of these nonces is a goal, the `sk` operation would need to be re-interpreted or combined with an encryption layer (e.g., `aenc(senc(Y, privK(X)), pubK(B))`). However, I will model it as described.\n\nHere is the Maude-NPA code:\n\n```maude\nselect MAUDE-NPA .\n\n(fmod SECURE-COMM-PROTOCOL-LIB is\n    pr NPASETTINGS . --- Provides Agent, Nonce, Key, Msg, Fresh,\n                   --- _;_ (concatenation), pubK, privK, senc, aenc.\n\n    --- Protocol Name: Secure Communication Protocol\n\n    --- Participants (example constants for instantiation; roles use variables)\n    --- op s, a, b : -> Agent [ctor] . --- Server, Initiator, Responder\n\n    --- Nonce Generation: N_A, N_S, N_B are handled as variables of sort Nonce.\n    --- Nonces are subsort of Fresh, Maude-NPA handles their fresh generation.\n\n    --- Key Usage:\n    --- sk(x, y) -> senc(y, privK(x))\n    --- pk(K, M) -> aenc(M, pubK(K)) (as per properties, not used in current message flow)\n    --- Concatenation _;_ is provided by NPASETTINGS and is associative.\n    --- The \"bounded to a depth of 3\" for associativity is an analytical constraint\n    --- rather than a syntactic one for the Maude operator.\nendfm)\n\n(mod SECURE-COMM-PROTOCOL-STRANDS is\n    pr SECURE-COMM-PROTOCOL-LIB .\n    pr STRAND . --- Provides strand [ ... ] syntax and basic operations.\n\n    --- Variables for role parameters\n    vars Apar Bpar Spar : Agent . --- Symbolic Initiator, Responder, Server\n    vars NSpar NApar : Nonce .   --- Symbolic nonces\n\n    --- Strand for the Server (S)\n    --- 1.

Marked `[ctor]` to ensure freshness.\n    *   `exp(Base : Msg, Exponent : Msg)`: The exponentiation function.\n    *   `_*_ : Nonce Nonce -> Nonce`: Multiplication for exponents, declared `[assoc comm ctor]`. Associativity and commutativity are standard. `ctor` here means `N1 * N2` is treated as a distinct term unless an equation reduces it.\n    *   `_,_`: Message concatenation (from `BASIC-PROTOCOL`).\n\n4.  **Algebraic Property**:\n    *   `eq exp(exp(GBase, N1), N2) = exp(GBase, (N1 * N2)) .`\n    *   This directly models `exp(exp(g, Y), Z) = exp(g, Y * Z)`.\n    *   `GBase` is a variable of sort `Gen` (ensuring it's `g`).\n    *   `N1`, `N2` are variables of sort `Nonce` (representing `Y` and `Z`).\n    *   The restriction \"X is restricted to being the generator g\" is handled by typing `GBase` as `Gen`.\n\n5.  **Strands**:\n    *   `alice`: Models participant A's actions.\n        *   Parameters: `Sender`, `Receiver`, `Generator`, `MyNonce`.\n        *   `MyNonce := n(Sender)` ensures Alice uses her own nonce.\n        *   `var TheirNonce : Nonce` is used to capture the nonce received from Bob.\n    *   `bob`: Models participant B's actions.\n        *   Similar structure to Alice's strand.\n        *   `MyNonce := n(Receiver)` ensures Bob uses his own nonce.\n\n6.  **Initial State**:\n    *   Two threads are created: one for Alice (a) talking to Bob (b), and one for Bob (b) expecting to talk to Alice (a).\n    *   `iknows`: The intruder knows all principals, the generator `g`, and their *own* nonce `n(i)`.\n\n7.  **Attack States**:\n    *   `secrecyOfAliceNonce`: Checks if the intruder `i` can learn `n(a)` when `a` and `b` are honest.\n    *   `secrecyOfBobNonce`: Checks if the intruder `i` can learn `n(b)` when `a` and `b` are honest and `b` has received a message (presumably from `a`).\n    *   `aliceAuthenticatesBobWrongNonce` (Optional): Checks if Alice completes the protocol with Bob, but the nonce she receives `exp(g, BobNonceReceived)` is such that `BobNonceReceived` is not `n(b)`. This is a form of authentication check.\n\n8.  **Maude-NPA Analysis**:\n    *   The `EXPONENTIAL-PROTOCOL-ANALYZE` module sets up for analysis.\n    *   The typical command to run the analysis in Maude would be `search [1] initial =>! attack .` (or `search initial =>! attack .` for unbounded search). This searches for any state reachable from `initial` that matches any of the defined `attack-state` patterns.\n\nThis code should provide a solid basis for analyzing your Exponential Communication Protocol with Maude-NPA.

Thus, message 1 is `A -> S: e(mkey(A), (B, NA))`.\n    *   The server decrypts messages addressed to it, processes them, and then encrypts messages for the recipients using their respective shared keys. For example, after receiving `(B,NA)` from Alice, the server sends `e(mkey(B), (A,NA))` to Bob. This allows Bob to obtain `NA` and verify its origin from Alice via the server. This interpretation is crucial for Bob to authenticate Alice, fulfilling the stated security goal.\n3.  **Nonce Handling**: `NA` is Alice's nonce, and `NB` is Bob's nonce. They are generated freshly by their originators.\n4.  **No Session Key**: The protocol steps you provided focus on nonce-based authentication and do not include the distribution or establishment of a session key. The Maude-NPA code reflects this.\n5.  **Claims**:\n    *   `Secret`: Claims that specific nonces (`NA`, `NB`) should remain confidential from the intruder.\n    *   `Commit`: A principal claims to be committed to a run of the protocol with another principal, based on received data (e.g., a nonce).\n    *   `Nisynch`: (Non-injective synchronization) A principal claims to have successfully completed their part of the protocol and believes they are synchronized with the other party.\n6.  **Structure for Analysis**: The main module `WOOLAM-PROTOCOL-ANALYSIS` defines the protocol. The commented-out `WOOLAM-PROTOCOL-CHECK` section provides a template for how you might set up initial states and attack patterns for formal verification with Maude-NPA.\n\nThis code should be compilable by Maude-NPA.

Nonces `n(f1)` and `n(f2)` are generated fresh.\n5.  **Secrecy Claim**: A claim `bob_nonce_nb_secret` is stated, asserting that Bob's nonce (`NB_`) should remain secret when Bob (`b`) is talking to Alice (`a`). The attack you described, where the intruder learns `NB_bob` by manipulating Alice, should lead to a counterexample for this claim.\n\nYou can use this file with the Maude-NPA tool to search for attacks that violate the specified secrecy claim.

For example, Alice (`A`) claims to have established `SKVar` for communication with Bob (`B`). Maude-NPA will check if this agreement holds (i.e., if Bob also agrees on `SKVar` with Alice).\n    *   **Critical point in Bob's role**: `out(< B, senc(KAS, < A, NAVar, n(FNB) >) >)`. As per your description, Bob encrypts the message to the server using `KAS` (which is `k(A,SInRole)`, Alice's master key). This is a significant deviation from standard Yahalom and a potential security weakness. For an honest Bob to perform this step, he must know Alice's master key. If `k(A,SInRole)` is truly secret between Alice and the Server, then an honest Bob cannot form this message. The Maude-NPA analysis will likely highlight implications of this, potentially showing that only an intruder (who might have compromised `KAS`) or a misconfigured system could allow this step.\n\nThis code should provide a good starting point for analyzing the described Yahalom variant with Maude-NPA. The tool will explore possible executions and check if the specified `secret` and `claim` properties are violated."]], "MAUDE-1/ISO_5_Pass_Authentication.maude": [[true, "(defModule ISO-FIVE-PASS-PROTOCOL-SPEC is\n  PROTECTING MAUDE-NPA .\n  FLAG (auto-contexts) .\n\n  (sorts UName SName Nonce SessKey MastKey)\n  (subsort UName SName < Prin)\n  (subsort Nonce < Data)\n  (subsort SessKey MastKey < Key)\n\n  (ops 'A 'B : -> UName)\n  (op 'S : -> SName)\n  ; Intruder 'i is predefined by Maude-NPA\n\n  (op k : Prin -> MastKey) ; k(P) is the master key of principal P, shared with/known by server S.\n\n  (op _,_ : Msg Msg -> Msg [ctor assoc prec 50]) ; Concatenation\n\n  (op enc : Msg Key -> Msg [ctor])\n  (op dec : Msg Key -> Msg)\n  (eq dec(enc(M:Msg, K:Key), K:Key) = M:Msg .)\n\n  (vars I R R_me : UName)\n  (vars Serv : SName) ; Changed from S to Serv to avoid clash in server role parameters\n  (vars Ra Rb1 : Nonce)\n  (vars Kab : SessKey)\n  (vars KIS KRS : MastKey)\n  (vars MsgForI : Msg)\n\n  (role alice\n    (I R : UName)        ; My name, Responder's name\n    (Serv : SName)       ; Server's name\n    (KIS : MastKey)      ; My master key k(I)\n    (Ra : Nonce new)     ; My nonce, fresh for this session\n    (Rb1 : Nonce)        ; Responder's nonce, learned\n    (Kab : SessKey)      ; Session key, learned\n  )\n  =\n    pre: eq(KIS = k(I)) ; Ensure KIS is indeed my master key\n    local: st(0)\n  actions:\n    (st(0) -> st(1) [\n      out: (I, Ra)\n    ])\n    (st(1) -> st(2) [\n      in: enc((Kab, R, Rb1), KIS) ; Expects: enc((session key, Bob's name, Bob's nonce), my master key)\n                                  ; R here is pattern-matched against the R parameter of the role.\n    ])\n    (st(2) -> st(3) [\n      out: enc((Ra, Rb1), Kab)\n    ])\n  endrole\n\n  (role bob\n    (I R_me : UName)      ; Initiator's name, My name\n    (Serv : SName)        ; Server's name\n    (KRS : MastKey)       ; My master key k(R_me)\n    (Ra : Nonce)          ; Initiator's nonce, learned\n    (Rb1 : Nonce new)     ; My nonce, fresh for this session\n    (Kab : SessKey)       ; Session key, learned\n    (MsgForI : Msg)       ; Placeholder for the message part to be forwarded to I\n  )\n  =\n    pre: eq(KRS = k(R_me))\n    local: st(0)\n  actions:\n    (st(0) -> st(1) [\n      in: (I, Ra)\n    ])\n    (st(1) -> st(2) [\n      out: (I, Ra, R_me, Rb1)\n    ])\n    (st(2) -> st(3) [\n      in: (enc((Kab, Rb1, I), KRS), MsgForI)\n          /\\ eq(MsgForI = enc((Kab, R_me, Rb1), k(I))) ; Bob verifies the structure of the message he must forward.\n                                                      ; He decrypts the first part to get Kab, and verifies his Rb1 and partner I.\n    ])\n    (st(3) -> st(4) [\n      out: MsgForI ; Forward the part for I (Alice)\n    ])\n    (st(4) -> st(5) [\n      in: enc((Ra, Rb1), Kab)\n    ])\n  endrole\n\n  (role server\n    (Serv_name : SName)     ; My name (Server's actual name, e.g. 'S)\n    (I R : UName)           ; Initiator's name, Responder's name (learned from request)\n    (Ra Rb1 : Nonce)        ; Nonces from I and R (learned from request)\n    (Kab : SessKey new)     ; Session key, fresh for this session\n  )\n  =\n    ; Server 'knows' master keys k(I) and k(R) by being able to apply the k() operator.\n    local: st(0)\n  actions:\n    (st(0) -> st(1) [\n      in: (I, Ra, R, Rb1)\n    ])\n    (st(1) -> st(2) [\n      out: (enc((Kab, Rb1, I), k(R)), enc((Kab, R, Rb1), k(I)))\n    ])\n  endrole\nendModule\n\n(SETUP\n  ISO-FIVE-PASS-PROTOCOL-SPEC ; Name of the protocol module\n\n  ( ; Strands: Define instances of roles for a typical run.\n    ; 'A, 'B, 'S are constants.

I've named it \"VULNERABLE\" as a placeholder; Otway-Rees has known vulnerabilities, and this specific 6-step variant might introduce new ones or alter existing ones.\n    *   `pr META-LEVEL . pr BASIC-PROTOCOL .`: Imports necessary predefined modules from Maude-NPA.\n\n2.  **Sorts**:\n    *   `Name`, `Agt` (Agent), `Srv` (Server).\n    *   `Nonce`, `Key`, `SKey` (Session Key), `MKey` (Master Key).\n    *   `Fresh`: Nonces and keys are declared as subsorts of `Fresh`, which is Maude-NPA's way of handling freshly generated values.\n\n3.  **Operations**:\n    *   `_,_`: Message concatenation (associative, commutative, with `null` as identity).\n    *   `enc`, `dec`: Encryption and decryption.\n    *   `mkey(Agt, Srv)`: Represents the long-term master key shared between an agent and the server.\n    *   `n(Fresh, Name)`: Nonce constructor. For example, `n(naF, a)` would be Alice's nonce generated from a fresh constant `naF`.\n    *   `k(Fresh, Name)`: Session key constructor. For example, `k(kSessF, s)` would be a session key generated by the server `s` from a fresh constant `kSessF`.\n\n4.  **Equations for Decryption**:\n    *   `eq dec(enc(M, K), K) = M .`: The fundamental property of symmetric encryption.\n\n5.  **Strands (`alice`, `bob`, `server`)**:\n    *   Each strand represents the sequence of messages sent (`+`) and received (`-`) by a participant in a specific role.\n    *   **`alice(A, B, S, Na, K, MsgAB, Nb)`**:\n        *   `A, B, S`: Identities of Alice, Bob, Server.\n        *   `Na`: Alice's nonce (she generates this).\n        *   `K`: Session key (she learns this from the server).\n        *   `MsgAB`: The part of the server's message intended for Bob (`enc((Na,K),mkey(B,S))`). Alice needs this variable to forward it.\n        *   `Nb`: Bob's nonce (she expects to receive this in the final confirmation).\n    *   **`bob(B, A, S, Na, Nb, K)`**:\n        *   `B, A, S`: Identities of Bob, Alice, Server.\n        *   `Na`: Alice's nonce (he receives this).\n        *   `Nb`: Bob's nonce (he generates this).\n        *   `K`: Session key (he learns this).\n    *   **`server(S, A1, B1, Na, K)`**:\n        *   `S, A1, B1`: Identities of Server, Initiator (Alice), Responder (Bob).\n        *   `Na`: Initiator's nonce (server receives this).\n        *   `K`: Session key (server generates this).\n\n6.  **Protocol Definition (`OtwayReesVulnerable`)**:\n    *   This operator is primarily for organizational purposes in more complex Maude-NPA setups but is good practice. It lists the roles involved.\n\n7.  **Initial State (`testInit`)**:\n    *   This sets up a specific scenario for analysis.\n    *   `a, b, i, s`: Concrete names for Alice, Bob, Intruder, Server.\n    *   `naF, nbF, kSessF, niF, kiF`: Fresh constants used to generate unique nonces and keys.\n    *   The `state` term includes instances of the `alice`, `bob`, and `server` strands with these concrete values.\n    *   `iknows (a, b, s, i, mkey(i,s), n(niF,i), k(kiF,i))`: The intruder initially knows public identities, its own identity, its own master key with the server, and can generate its own nonces/keys.\n    *   **Crucially, `mkey(a,s)` and `mkey(b,s)` are NOT in `iknows`** because these are the secret master keys of honest agents.\n    *   `(fresh ...)`: Declares which specific fresh constants are used in this initial state.\n\n8.  **Attack State (`attackState`)**:\n    *   Defines what constitutes a successful attack. Here, it's defined as the intruder learning the specific session key `k(kSessF,s)` that was supposed to be established between `a` and `b`.\n    *   `uncompromised(STATE)`: A Maude-NPA predicate to ensure we are not checking for trivial attacks where the key was already compromised.\n\n9.  **Search Command**:\n    *   The `(search ...)` command is how you ask Maude-NPA to look for an attack. It starts from `testInit` and tries to reach a state matching `attackState`.\n    *   It's often better to put the `(maude) ... (search ...)` part in a separate `.maude` file (e.g., `run-OR.maude`) that loads your protocol specification file.\n\n**To use this code:**\n\n1.  Save it as a `.maude` file (e.g., `OR-variant-MaudeNPA.maude`).\n2.  You'll need Maude and Maude-NPA installed.\n3.  You can run the search from within Maude after loading the file, or create a separate script file.\n\nThis Maude-NPA model formalizes the 6-step protocol you described. The steps 4, 5, and 6 are non-standard for Otway-Rees and might introduce different security properties or vulnerabilities compared to the classic version. The analysis would reveal if `k(kSessF,s)` can be compromised under these rules."]]}
