It incorporates nonces (`T1`, `T2`) for freshness.\n\n**Detailed Flow (Based on Description):**\n\n1.  **Da -> GW**:\n    *   `Da` generates `T1`.\n    *   `Rq = IDa || cxt || c`\n    *   `M = Rq XOR h(SKa)`\n    *   `Da` sends `(M, T1)` to `GW`.\n\n2.  **GW -> Da**:\n    *   `GW` receives `(M, T1)`.\n    *   `GW` generates `T2`.\n    *   `GW` constructs a message that \"includes\" `(IDa || cxt || Resp) XOR h(SKa)`. Let's call this part `M_GW`.\n    *   `GW` sends `(M_GW, T2)` to `Da`.\n\n**Implicit Steps and Requirements:**\n\n*   For `GW` to process `M`, it needs to know `h(SKa)` associated with the requesting user `Da`. Since `IDa` is contained *within* `M` (encrypted), `GW` must have a way to identify the user *before* decrypting `M` to look up the correct `h(SKa)`. This strongly implies that `IDa` must be sent *in plaintext* alongside `M` and `T1`.\n*   Assuming `IDa` is sent in plaintext, the flow becomes:\n    *   **Da -> GW**: `(IDa, M = (IDa || cxt || c) XOR h(SKa), T1)`\n    *   **GW Processing**:\n        *   Receive `(IDa, M, T1)`.\n        *   Look up `h(SKa)` using `IDa`.\n        *   Calculate `Rq_prime = M XOR h(SKa)`.\n        *   Verify `Rq_prime` parses correctly and contains the expected `IDa`, `cxt`, and `c`. This step authenticates `Da` to `GW` (knowledge of `h(SKa)`).\n        *   Determine `Resp` (presumably based on `IDa` and validated request).\n        *   Generate `T2`.\n        *   Calculate `M_GW = (IDa || cxt || Resp) XOR h(SKa)`.\n    *   **GW -> Da**: `(M_GW, T2)` (Assuming the full message is `M_GW || T2`).\n*   **Da Processing**:\n    *   Receive `(M_GW, T2)`.\n    *   Calculate `Expected_Payload = M_GW XOR h(SKa)`.\n    *   Verify `Expected_Payload` parses correctly and contains the original `IDa` and `cxt`. This step authenticates `GW` to `Da` (knowledge of `h(SKa)` and the request context). `Da` also learns `Resp`.\n\n**Security Properties Evaluation:**\n\n1.  **Authentication:**\n    *   `Da` authenticates `GW`: Yes, `GW` proves knowledge of `h(SKa)` by successfully encrypting the response `M_GW` which `Da` can decrypt and verify contains the correct `IDa` and `cxt`.\n    *   `GW` authenticates `Da`: Yes, `Da` proves knowledge of `h(SKa)` by successfully encrypting the request `M` which `GW` can decrypt and verify contains the correct `IDa`. (This relies on `IDa` being sent in plaintext for `GW` to look up the key).\n\n2.  **Confidentiality:**\n    *   The contents of `Rq` (`IDa || cxt || c`) are confidential during transit between `Da` and `GW` because they are XORed with `h(SKa)`.\n    *   The contents of the payload in `M_GW` (`IDa || cxt || Resp`) are confidential during transit for the same reason.\n    *   `T1`, `T2`, and (likely necessary) the plaintext `IDa` are *not* confidential.\n\n3.  **Integrity:**\n    *   **Weakness:** There is *no explicit integrity check* (like a MAC) on the messages `M` or `M_GW`. An attacker could perform a bit-flipping attack on the ciphertext. Since XOR is linear, flipping a bit in `M` will flip the corresponding bit in `Rq_prime` when `GW` decrypts it. Similarly for `M_GW`. While `GW` might detect an invalid format or an `IDa` mismatch after decrypting a tampered `M`, there's no cryptographic guarantee that the message hasn't been altered in transit *without* the attacker knowing `h(SKa)`. The same applies to `M_GW` received by `Da`.\n\n4.  **Replay Protection:**\n    *   `T1` (generated by `Da`) helps protect against replay of `Da`'s request `(IDa, M, T1)`. `GW` should check if `T1` has been seen recently.\n    *   `T2` (generated by `GW`) helps protect against replay of `GW`'s response `(M_GW, T2)`. `Da` should check if `T2` has been seen recently.\n    *   **Weakness:** The protocol lacks cryptographic binding between the request and the response. `M_GW` does *not* incorporate `T1`. An attacker who recorded an old `(M_GW, T2)` pair could potentially replay it. If `Da` only checks `T2` freshness and `M_GW` decrypts correctly, `Da` might accept an old response corresponding to a *different* request (`T1`). Cryptographic linkage (e.g., including `T1` in the calculation of `M_GW` or a MAC covering `M_GW` and `T1`) is missing.\n\n5.  **Session Establishment:**\n    *   The protocol establishes mutual authentication. `Resp` is exchanged in `M_GW`. The description says `Resp` is a \"response variable used in the protocol's message exchanges\". It's not explicitly defined how a secure session key is derived or used *after* this exchange. `h(SKa)` is a long-term secret (or derived from one) and should ideally not be used directly as a session key for subsequent communication to provide forward secrecy (if `SKa` is compromised later, past sessions are compromised). A session key should ideally be derived from `h(SKa)`, `T1`, and `T2`.\n\n6.  **Other Components:**\n    *   `Enforce`, `Role`, `Capability`, `Permission`, `Priority` functions are mentioned but their usage within the described flow is not specified. It's unclear how they contribute to the cryptographic security of *this specific exchange*.\n\n**Claims Evaluation:**\n\n*   `Alive` Claim: The exchange of nonces and response messages generally supports the claim that both parties are active.\n*   `Weakagree`, `Niagree`, `Nisynch` Claims: The protocol aims for agreement on `IDa`, `cxt`, and `Resp`, and synchronization via nonces. However, the lack of integrity protection means that agreement/synchronization is only guaranteed *if no attacks occur*. A bit-flipping attack could lead to disagreement on the received values. The weak linkage between request and response also undermines perfect synchronization claims.\n*   `Secret` Claim: The protocol relies on `SKa` (and `h(SKa)`) remaining secret to `Da` and `GW`. The protocol design doesn't expose `SKa` or `h(SKa)` directly, relying on them only for XOR operations. However, side-channel attacks or implementation flaws could potentially compromise the secret.\n\n**Summary of Weaknesses:**\n\n1.  **No Message Integrity:** Vulnerable to bit-flipping attacks due to reliance solely on XOR encryption without authentication.\n2.  **Weak Request-Response Linkage:** Vulnerable to certain replay attacks where an old response could be accepted if not properly linked to the current request's nonce.\n3.  **Ambiguous Key Lookup:** Requires plaintext `IDa` for `GW` to look up `h(SKa)`, which isn't explicitly stated in the message flow description but is implied by the structure.\n4.  **Undefined Session Key Derivation:** The mechanism for establishing and using a secure session key for subsequent communication is not defined.\n5.  **Undefined Component Usage:** The role of `Enforce`, `Role`, etc., within this specific handshake is unclear.\n\n**Potential Improvements:**\n\n1.  **Add Message Authentication Codes (MACs):** Include a MAC, calculated using a key derived from `h(SKa)`, over the entire message content (including nonces and the XORed part) to ensure integrity and detect tampering.\n2.  **Strengthen Linkage:** Include the peer's nonce (`T1` in `GW`'s response, `T2` in `Da`'s potential subsequent messages if any) in the data covered by the MAC or the encrypted payload to cryptographically bind the messages together.\n3.  **Explicitly Define Message Formats:** Clearly state what data is sent in plaintext and what is encrypted/authenticated in each step. Explicitly include `IDa` in the first message in plaintext if needed for key lookup.\n4.  **Define Session Key Derivation:** Specify a secure method to derive a session key (e.g., using `h(SKa)`, `T1`, and `T2` with a KDF) for subsequent communication.\n5.  **Clarify Component Roles:** Explain how the other listed functions (`Enforce`, `Role`, etc.) integrate into the security logic of the protocol exchange itself, if they do.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe AccessRequest protocol provides mutual authentication and confidentiality for the sensitive request/response data by leveraging a shared secret and nonces. However, its significant lack of message integrity checks and weak request-response linkage make it vulnerable to active attacks like bit-flipping and certain replays. While it establishes trust based on shared knowledge of `h(SKa)`, it needs enhancements with standard cryptographic techniques like MACs and clearer message binding to be considered robustly secure. The role of several listed components and the method for establishing a session key for ongoing communication are also not fully described, leaving potential gaps."]], "SPDL-1/boyd.spdl": [[false, "Okay, let's break down and analyze the provided description of the Boyd Key Agreement protocol based on the text provided.\n\n### Analysis of Boyd Key Agreement Protocol Description\n\n**1. Protocol Identification:**\n*   **Name:** Boyd Key Agreement\n*   **Authors:** Boyd & Mathuria\n*   **Reference:** Protocols for Authentication and Key Establishment (2003), p. 101\n\n**2. Purpose and Goal:**\n*   To enable an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R) to establish a shared secret session key (`ks`) securely.\n*   The process relies on a trusted third party, the Server (S), for key generation and distribution.\n\n**3. Parties Involved:**\n*   **Initiator (I):** Starts the protocol, initiates key establishment with R.\n*   **Responder (R):** Responds to I, confirms key establishment.\n*   **Server (S):** Trusted third party, generates the session key `ks`, assists in its distribution.\n\n**4. Key Components & Cryptographic Primitives (as described/implied):**\n*   **Nonces (`ni`, `nr`):** Random numbers generated by I and R respectively to ensure freshness and protect against replay attacks.\n*   **Session Key (`ks`):** The secret key generated by S and intended to be shared between I and R for secure communication. This is also referred to as \"Macseed\" in the description, suggesting its primary use might be for Message Authentication Codes (MACs).\n*   **Pre-shared Long-Term Keys:** Implied by the notation `{...}k(A,B)`. It is assumed that:\n    *   I and S share a secret key `k(I,S)`.\n    *   R and S share a secret key `k(R,S)`.\n*   **Symmetric Encryption/MAC (`{...}k`):** Used with pre-shared keys to provide integrity and/or confidentiality for message blocks. The notation `{ I, R, ks }k(I,S)` indicates a block containing `I`, `R`, and `ks` is encrypted or MACed using the key `k(I,S)`.\n*   **Function `m(...)`:** Used to derive values or create confirmations. The description uses it in two forms:\n    *   `m(ks,ni,nr)`: This is claimed as the final shared secret. It appears to be a value derived from the session key and both nonces, likely via a cryptographic hash or MAC function using `ks`.\n    *   `m(ni, m(ks,ni,nr))` and `m(nr, m(ks,ni,nr))`: These are used in steps 3 and 4 as challenge-response/confirmation messages. They likely represent MACs or functions that bind the previously computed secret `m(ks,ni,nr)` to the specific nonce (`ni` or `nr`), confirming possession of the secret and involvement in the specific protocol run.\n\n**5. Protocol Message Flow:**\nThe description outlines 4 steps:\n\n1.  **I -> S:** `I, R, ni`\n    *   Initiator sends its ID, the Responder's ID, and its nonce `ni` to the Server.\n2.  **S -> R:** `{ I, R, ks }k(I,S)`, `{ I, R, ks }k(R,S)`, `ni`\n    *   Server generates `ks`.\n    *   Server creates two blocks: one for I (encrypted/MACed with `k(I,S)`) and one for R (encrypted/MACed with `k(R,S)`), both containing `I`, `R`, and `ks`.\n    *   Server sends *both* blocks, along with `ni`, to the Responder. *(Note: Sending the block for I via R is a common pattern in TTP protocols like Needham-Schroeder)*.\n3.  **R -> I:** `{ I, R, ks }k(I,S)`, `m(ni, m(ks,ni,nr))`, `nr`\n    *   Responder receives the message from S.\n    *   Responder decrypts/verifies `{ I, R, ks }k(R,S)` using `k(R,S)` to obtain `I`, `R`, and `ks`. R now knows `ks`.\n    *   Responder extracts `ni` (presumably from the message received in step 2).\n    *   Responder generates its nonce `nr`.\n    *   Responder computes `m(ks,ni,nr)`.\n    *   Responder computes `m(ni, m(ks,ni,nr))`.\n    *   Responder sends the block intended for I (`{ I, R, ks }k(I,S)`), the confirmation value `m(ni, m(ks,ni,nr))`, and its nonce `nr` to the Initiator.\n4.  **I -> R:** `m(nr, m(ks,ni,nr))`\n    *   Initiator receives the message from R (Step 3).\n    *   Initiator decrypts/verifies `{ I, R, ks }k(I,S)` using `k(I,S)` to obtain `I`, `R`, and `ks`. I now knows `ks`.\n    *   Initiator extracts `nr`. Initiator already has `ni` (it generated it).\n    *   Initiator computes `m(ks,ni,nr)`.\n    *   Initiator receives `m(ni, m(ks,ni,nr))` and verifies it using `ni` and its computed `m(ks,ni,nr)`. This confirms R's identity and that R knows `ks` and `nr` (and received `ni`).\n    *   Initiator computes `m(nr, m(ks,ni,nr))`.\n    *   Initiator sends `m(nr, m(ks,ni,nr))` to Responder.\n\n**6. Claims:**\n*   **I claims:** `m(ks,ni,nr)` is the shared secret (`claim_6`).\n*   **R claims:** `m(ks,ni,nr)` is the shared secret (`claim_10`).\n\n**7. Security Properties & Goals (as stated/implied):**\n*   **Key Establishment:** A shared secret `m(ks,ni,nr)` is established between I and R.\n*   **Freshness:** Nonces (`ni`, `nr`) ensure that the established key and subsequent authentication are tied to a specific, current run of the protocol. This helps prevent replay attacks.\n*   **Authentication (Mutual):**\n    *   I authenticates S (indirectly via R) by verifying the block `{ I, R, ks }k(I,S)`.\n    *   I authenticates R by receiving and verifying `m(ni, m(ks,ni,nr))`, which implies R knew `ks` (from S) and received `ni`.\n    *   R authenticates S by verifying the block `{ I, R, ks }k(R,S)`.\n    *   R authenticates I by receiving and verifying `m(nr, m(ks,ni,nr))`, which implies I knew `ks` and received `nr`.\n*   **Confidentiality/Integrity:** Cryptographic operations `{...}k` protect the contents they enclose (including `ks`) during transit between parties that share the key.\n\n**8. Interpretation Notes & Potential Ambiguities:**\n*   The exact cryptographic function `m(...)` is not fully specified. Assuming `m(ks,ni,nr)` is a secure MAC or KDF result using `ks` and nonces, and `m(A, B)` is a MAC/hash function of `B` using `A` or a combination, the confirmation steps make sense. However, the notation `m(ni, m(ks,ni,nr))` is slightly unusual and could be interpreted in different ways (e.g., MAC using `ni` as key? Concatenation and hash?). A common interpretation in protocols of this era might be something like `MAC(ks, ni || m(ks,ni,nr))` and `MAC(ks, nr || m(ks,ni,nr))`, or perhaps a hash `H(ni || m(ks,ni,nr))` where the verification involves checking if the received value matches the computed one. Given `ks` is shared and `m(ks,ni,nr)` is the derived secret, it's most likely that `ks` is involved in computing `m(ni, m(ks,ni,nr))` and `m(nr, m(ks,ni,nr))` as well, perhaps within `m(ks, ...)`. Let's assume for robustness that `m(A,B)` represents `MAC(ks, A || B)` or a similar construct binding the data to `ks`.\n*   The description states R \"extracts the nonce ni\" in Step 3 upon receiving the message from the server (Step 2). This confirms R received `ni` in Step 2.\n\n**9. Summary:**\nThe Boyd Key Agreement protocol is a 4-message, 3-party protocol using a trusted server for key distribution. It relies on pre-shared long-term keys between parties and the server, nonces for freshness, and symmetric cryptographic operations (implied encryption/MAC and a function `m`) to distribute a server-generated session key (`ks`) and derive a shared secret (`m(ks,ni,nr)`). The final two messages involving challenges/responses using the nonces confirm that both I and R are live, possess the keying material (`ks`), and are aware of the nonces, thereby providing mutual authentication and key confirmation."]], "SPDL-1/CapabilityRevocation_CRCBAC.spdl": [[false, "Okay, here is a high-level description of the `CapabilityRevoke` protocol using Alice & Bob notation, based on your description.\n\n**Protocol Name:** CapabilityRevoke\n\n**Roles:**\n*   `Da`: Requester (initiator)\n*   `GW`: Gateway (responder)\n\n**Secrets & Shared Knowledge:**\n*   `SKa`: Secret key held by `Da`.\n*   `h`: A public hash function.\n*   `h(SKa)`: The hash of `Da`'s secret key. `GW` is assumed to know `h(SKa)` associated with `Da`'s identifier (`IDa`).\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1.  **`Da` -> `GW`:** `Payload \\oplus h(SKa), T1`\n    *   `Da` wants to revoke a capability related to some `Context`.

Message fields separated by commas implies they are distinct fields, and the `{...}` in the signature part indicates the data being signed. We'll use concatenation `||` for data being signed.\n\nLet's lay out the protocol flow more formally based on the description and assumptions:\n\n**Protocol Entities:** Initiator (I), Responder (R)\n**Shared Knowledge:** Public keys `pk(I)`, `pk(R)` (assumed exchanged securely out-of-band or via PKI), identities I and R, definitions of `g1`, `g2`, `h1`, `sign`, `verify`.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n**I:**\n1.  Chooses a fresh random nonce `x`.\n2.  (Internal: \"Compromise Message\")\n3.  Computes `alpha = g1(x)`.\n4.  Computes `Sig_I = sign(sk(I), alpha || R)`.\n5.  Sends Message 1 to R: `alpha, R, Sig_I`.\n\n**R:**\n1.  Receives Message 1: `alpha_rcvd, R_rcvd, Sig_I_rcvd`.\n2.  Verifies `Sig_I_rcvd` using `pk(I)` on `alpha_rcvd || R_rcvd`.\n3.  Checks if `R_rcvd` is R's identity.\n4.  If verification and checks pass, lets `alpha = alpha_rcvd`.\n5.  Chooses a fresh random nonce `y`.\n6.  Chooses a fresh random nonce `i`.\n7.  Computes `beta = g1(y)`.\n8.  Computes `Sig_R = sign(sk(R), alpha || beta || i || I)`. (Using R's description of M2 content)\n9.  Sends Message 2 to I: `alpha, beta, i, I, Sig_R`.\n\n**I:**\n1.  Receives Message 2: `alpha'_rcvd, beta'_rcvd, i_rcvd, I_rcvd, Sig_R_rcvd`.\n2.  Verifies `Sig_R_rcvd` using `pk(R)` on `alpha'_rcvd || beta'_rcvd || i_rcvd || I_rcvd`.\n3.  Checks if `I_rcvd` is I's identity.\n4.  Checks if `alpha'_rcvd` is the `alpha` I sent in M1 (`g1(x)`). (Important check for linking M2 to M1).\n5.  If verification and checks pass, lets `beta = beta'_rcvd`.\n6.  Computes `hash_val = h1(beta, x)`. (Using the received `beta` and I's secret `x`).\n7.  Sends Message 3 to R: `hash_val`.\n8.  Claims Shared Secret `SK_I = g2(beta, x)`. (Using the received `beta` and I's secret `x`).\n\n**R:**\n1.  Receives Message 3: `hash_val_rcvd`.\n2.  Claims Shared Secret `SK_R = g2(alpha, y)`. (Using the received `alpha` and R's secret `y`).\n\n**Analysis and Potential Issues:**\n\nLet's evaluate the protocol against standard goals and the claimed properties:\n\n1.  **Key Agreement:**\n    *   I claims `SK_I = g2(beta, x)`, where `beta = g1(y)` (sent by R) and `x` is I's secret. So I claims `SK_I = g2(g1(y), x)`.\n    *   R claims `SK_R = g2(alpha, y)`, where `alpha = g1(x)` (sent by I) and `y` is R's secret. So R claims `SK_R = g2(g1(x), y)`.\n    *   **Problem:** For I and R to derive the *same* shared secret, it must hold that `g2(g1(y), x) = g2(g1(x), y)` for all valid secret inputs `x` and `y`. This is *not* a general property of PRFs or cryptographic hash functions. Standard Diffie-Hellman works because of the algebraic property of exponentiation: `(g^y)^x = g^{xy} = (g^x)^y`. This protocol replaces exponentiation with function applications, and it's highly likely `g2(g1(y), x)` is different from `g2(g1(x), y)`. **The protocol, as described, fails to establish a common shared secret.**\n\n2.  **Authentication:**\n    *   M1 is signed by I using `sk(I)`. R can verify its origin using `pk(I)`. This authenticates I to R for this message and the contained `alpha`.\n    *   M2 is signed by R using `sk(R)`. I can verify its origin using `pk(R)`. This authenticates R to I for this message and the contained `alpha` and `beta`. The inclusion of `alpha` in R's signature on M2 helps link M2 to the specific M1 it is a response to, preventing an attacker from getting I to sign M1 and R to sign a different M2 independently and combining them. The inclusion of `i` also adds session freshness to the signed part of M2.\n    *   M3 is an unauthenticated hash value. There is no signature or MAC on M3.\n    *   **Problem:** An attacker could potentially intercept M2, substitute a different value for `beta'` (though they wouldn't know `y` to compute a valid `g1(y)`, they could potentially substitute a random value or a previously observed `g1(y')` from another session if no session identifier is bound to `g1`'s output), and I would compute `h1` with this substituted value. M3 is then computed using a potentially wrong `beta`, and sent to R. R receives M3 but has no way to verify it. R *expects* `h1(g1(y), x)`, but R doesn't know `x`. **M3 is unauthenticated and unverifiable by R.** R cannot confirm that I correctly received M2 and computed the hash using the expected `beta` and I's secret `x`. This leaves R vulnerable to a type of unknown key-share attack or simply thinking the key exchange succeeded when I failed to process M2 correctly or an attacker interfered with M3.\n\n3.  **Integrity:**\n    *   M1 and M2 have integrity protected by the digital signatures on their contents.\n    *   M3 has no integrity protection.\n    *   **Problem:** An attacker can tamper with M3 in transit without detection by R.\n\n4.  **Freshness:**\n    *   I uses nonce `x` for its contribution `g1(x)`.\n    *   R uses nonce `y` for its contribution `g1(y)` and nonce `i` in the signed part of M2.\n    *   The nonces `x` and `y` are secret inputs to the key derivation functions. The nonce `i` is public but included in the signature, helping to distinguish different sessions involving the same parties. This seems reasonable for establishing session freshness, provided the signatures prevent replay attacks on M1 and M2.\n\n5.  **PRF Usage:**\n    *   Replacing standard DH exponentiation with `g1(x)` and `g1(y)` fundamentally changes the mathematical basis of the key exchange. The properties needed for `g1` (producing a public value from a secret) and `g2` (combining secrets and public values to produce a shared secret) are not the same as those required for DH. As noted above, the lack of a commutative property like `g2(g1(y), x) = g2(g1(x), y)` is fatal for shared key derivation.\n    *   The use of `h1(beta, x)` for M3 and `g2(beta, x)` for the key seems arbitrary if `h1` and `g2` are unrelated. Typically, a confirmation message would be a hash of the established key and the exchanged values (e.g., `hash(SK || alpha || beta)`), allowing the other party to verify the key was correctly derived.\n\n6.  **\"Compromise Message\":** This likely refers to a notation used in formal verification tools (like ProVerif) to model the beginning of an attack trace or session instance. It's not a cryptographic step within the protocol itself.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe described \"Two-Move Diffie-Hellman with Pseudo-Random Functions\" protocol, as detailed, suffers from fundamental flaws:\n\n1.  **It fails to establish a common shared secret key** due to the likely non-commutative nature of the functions `g1` and `g2`.\n2.  **The final message (M3) is unauthenticated and unverifiable by the responder**, leaving R vulnerable and unable to confirm the key exchange's successful completion from I's perspective.\n\nWhile it incorporates elements like nonces and signatures for message authentication similar to parts of ISO 9798-3, the critical step of shared key derivation is not soundly designed, and the finalization step is insecure.

Encryption is explicitly stated to use `Kcm`.\n    *   *Message:* `encrypt(Kcm, {C_ID:UID, Amount:Amount, Sm:Signature})`\n    *   *Notes:* `Sm` is M's signature, presumably on the transaction details (`C_ID`, `Amount`, possibly `Nm`, `Nc`, or `IDt`).\n\n**Phase 3: Transaction Confirmation (C \u2194 B and B \u2194 M/C)**\n*   **Step 4 (C \u2192 B):** C receives M's request, verifies it (using `Kcm` for decryption, M's public key `pk(M)` for `Sm`), and sends an encrypted confirmation to B including C's ID, M's ID, Amount, `Sm`, and C's Signature (`Sc`).\n    *   *Message:* `encrypt(?, {C_ID:UID, M_ID:UID, Amount:Amount, Sm:Signature, Sc:Signature})`\n    *   *Notes:* The description *does not specify* the encryption key used between C and B (`encrypt(?,...)`). This is a critical missing detail. It could be `pk(B)` (B's public key), a shared secret key between C and B, or a session key established earlier (though no C-B key exchange is described). `Sc` is C's signature, likely on the confirmation details (`C_ID`, `M_ID`, `Amount`, `Sm`).\n*   **Step 5 (B \u2192 M and B \u2192 C):** B receives C's confirmation (and presumably decrypts and verifies signatures `Sm` and `Sc` using `pk(M)` and `pk(C)`), processes the transaction, and sends encrypted payment confirmations back to M and C.\n    *   *Message to M:* `encrypt(?, PaymentConfirmation_M)`\n    *   *Message to C:* `encrypt(?, PaymentConfirmation_C)`\n    *   *Notes:* Again, the encryption keys used by B (`encrypt(?,...)`) are not specified. This could be `pk(M)`, `pk(C)`, or session keys. The description lists `Sb` as a macro and B claims knowledge of its signature, but the flow *doesn't explicitly state* that B *signs* these confirmation messages, although this would be necessary for authenticity and non-repudiation from B.\n\n**Claims:**\n*   **M Claims:** Knowledge of transaction secrets.\n*   **C Claims:** Knowledge of `Kcm` and its own transaction-related secrets.\n*   **B Claims:** Knowledge of the transaction Timestamp and its own signature (`Sb`).\n\n**Security Claims:**\n*   Confidentiality\n*   Integrity\n*   Authenticity\n*   Non-repudiation\n\n**Summary Observations:**\n\n*   The protocol structure involves distinct phases for key establishment, request, and confirmation.\n*   It leverages both symmetric cryptography (via `Kcm`) and asymmetric cryptography (for signatures `Sm`, `Sc`, `Sb`).\n*   Key derivation function `k` is used to generate `Kcm`, likely from nonces exchanged in Phase 1.\n*   Signatures (`Sm`, `Sc`) are included in messages for authenticity and non-repudiation.\n*   There are ambiguities in the description regarding:\n    *   The specific content being MACed in Phase 1 and the keys used for those MACs.\n    *   The exact content being signed by M (`Sm`) and C (`Sc`).\n    *   The encryption keys used for messages between C and B (C\u2192B) and from B to M/C (B\u2192M, B\u2192C).\n    *   Whether B explicitly signs its confirmation messages (`Sb` is listed but not shown in the flow).\n    *   Where the `IDt` (transaction hash) macro is used in the actual message flow.\n\nThis breakdown provides a clearer view of the defined steps and components, while also highlighting areas that would require clarification for a precise implementation or formal security analysis."]], "SPDL-1/en_y-v0.spdl": [[true, "# myProtocol.spdl\n\nprotocol myProtocol\n\n# Declare the hash function used in the protocol\nhash h\n\n# Define the role of the Initiator (I)\n# The initiator knows its own secret key (sk(I)) and the responder's public key (pk(R))\nrole initiator (I, R, sk(I), pk(R))\n  #

(Note: Step 4 implies `k1` is used as a symmetric key, although `pk` is described as the public key function. We'll represent it as `encrypt(k1, k2)` as per the description but note this ambiguity).\n*   Nonce generation: `fresh()`.\n\n**Initial Knowledge:**\n*   `I` knows: `sk_I` (I's secret key for signing), `pk_I` (I's public key), `pk_R` (R's public key).\n*   `R` knows: `sk_R` (R's secret key for signing), `pk_R` (R's public key), `pk_I` (I's public key).\n*   Implicitly, parties can verify the correspondence between public and secret keys (via `inversekeys` concept, often modeled by the key structure itself).\n\n**Protocol Steps and Messages:**\n\n**Initialization:**\n*   `R` generates a fresh nonce `k2`.\n\n**Message Exchange:**\n\n1.  **`I` -> `R`: `ni`**\n    *   `I` generates a fresh nonce `ni`.\n    *   `I` sends `ni` to `R`.\n    *   *I's State:* Stores `ni`.\n\n2.  **`R` -> `I`: `sign(sk_R, ni)`**\n    *   `R` receives `ni` from `I`.\n    *   `R` calculates `s2 = sign(sk_R, ni)`.\n    *   `R` sends `s2` to `I`.\n    *   *R's State:* Stores `ni_received` (should match `ni`), `k2`.\n\n3.  **`I` -> `R`: `sign(sk_I, encrypt(pk_R, k1))`**\n    *   `I` receives `s2` from `R`.\n    *   `I` verifies `verify(pk_R, ni, s2)`. If invalid, `I` aborts.\n    *   `I` generates a fresh nonce `k1`.\n    *   `I` calculates `e3 = encrypt(pk_R, k1)`.\n    *   `I` calculates `s3 = sign(sk_I, e3)`.\n    *   `I` sends `s3` to `R`.\n    *   *I's State:* Stores `ni`, `k1`.\n\n4.  **`R` -> `I`: `encrypt(k1, k2)`**\n    *   `R` receives `s3` from `I`.\n    *   `R` attempts to parse `s3` into `s3_value`.\n    *   `R` verifies `verify(pk_I, e3_value, s3_value)` where `e3_value` is the expected message content before signing (i.e., the encrypted part). If invalid, `R` aborts.\n    *   If verification passes, `R` decrypts `k1_recovered = decrypt(sk_R, e3_value)`.\n    *   `R` calculates `e4 = encrypt(k1_recovered, k2)`. (Assumption: `encrypt(k, M)` here means symmetric encryption with key `k`).\n    *   `R` sends `e4` to `I`.\n    *   *R's State:* Stores `ni_received`, `k2`, `k1_recovered`.\n\n**Claims:**\n\n*   **From R's perspective, after step 4:** `Secret(k2, {R})` - The nonce `k2` is a secret and should be known only to `R`.\n    *   *Note:* Based on step 4 (`R` sends `encrypt(k1, k2)` to `I`), if `I` can successfully decrypt this message using `k1` (which `I` knows), then `I` will learn `k2`. This contradicts the claim that `k2` is known *only* to `R`. A security analysis tool would likely flag this as a violation of the secrecy claim. The claim as stated in the description (`k2` is secret and known only to role R) seems incompatible with the final message flow as described.\n\n**Potential Ambiguities / Notes:**\n*   The function `encrypt(k1, k2)` in step 4 is described as encrypting with a nonce `k1`. Given `pk` is the public key encryption function, this step likely implies symmetric encryption using `k1` as a symmetric key. The specification assumes this interpretation.\n*   The claim regarding `k2`'s secrecy appears inconsistent with the final message exchange if `I` is able to decrypt message 4.\n\n---"]], "SPDL-1/andrew-ban-1.spdl": [[false, "```tla+\n------------------------------ MODULE BANModifiedAndrewSecureRPC ------------------------------\n\nEXTENDS SPORE, TLC\n\n(*\n  This module specifies the BAN Modified Andrew Secure RPC protocol\n  based on the provided description, using the SPORE TLA+ library.\n\n  Overview:\n  A 4-message protocol between an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R)\n  to establish a fresh session key (kir), using a pre-shared symmetric\n  long-term key (K_IR).\n\n  Key Components:\n  - Principals: Initiator (I), Responder (R)\n  - Keys: Pre-shared K_IR, Session key kir\n  - Nonces: ni (I), nr (R1), nr2 (R2)\n  - Messages: Sets of values encrypted with K_IR\n  - Claims: Nisynch, Niagree, Secret, Fresh\n\n  Protocol Flow:\n  I -> R: {I, ni}_K_IR      (Msg1)\n  R -> I: {nr, ni}_K_IR      (Msg2)\n  I -> R: {nr}_K_IR        (Msg3)\n  R -> I: {kir, nr2, ni}_K_IR (Msg4)\n\n*)\n\n(* -- Constants -- *)\n\nCONSTANT I, R      (* Principals *)\nCONSTANT K_IR      (* Pre-shared long-term key *)\n\n(* Define the set of principals *)\nPrincipals == {I, R}\n\n(* Define the set of initial keys known to the system *)\nInitialKeys == {K_IR}\n\n(* Define the set of possible nonces and keys - usually infinite in theory,\n   but TLC requires finite sets for model checking.

It mentions the use of standard cryptographic primitives (encryption, decryption, hashing, XOR, and a POW function potentially for key exchange) and introduces concepts like nonces for freshness and claims for verification. However, the description is highly **incomplete** and lacks the crucial details necessary for a proper security analysis.\n\n**Analysis of Provided Information:**\n\n1.  **Roles and Interaction (Inferred):**\n    *   The protocol involves a chain-like structure: DeviceA interacts with Edge, Edge interacts with DeviceB, and finally, DeviceA and DeviceB interact directly.\n    *   Edge appears to act as an intermediary or facilitator, potentially for initial authentication, key establishment components, or routing.\n    *   The ultimate goal is a direct session key between DeviceA and DeviceB.\n\n2.  **Cryptographic Primitives:**\n    *   **E/D (Encryption/Decryption):** Standard cryptographic functions, likely asymmetric (using public/private keys PRa, PUa, PRedge, PUedge, PRb, PUb) for key exchange or identity verification, and potentially symmetric (if a session key is established early with Edge) for message confidentiality. The specific algorithms (e.g., RSA, AES) are not mentioned.\n    *   **H (Hash):** Used for integrity checks, message digests, or derivation functions. The specific hash function (e.g., SHA-256) is not mentioned.\n    *   **XOR:** A basic bitwise operation often used in key derivation or mixing data, sometimes in conjunction with stream ciphers or hashing.\n    *   **POW (Exponentiation):** Strongly suggests a Diffie-Hellman-like key exchange mechanism is involved, likely contributing to the SessionKey derivation.\n\n3.  **Variables and Constants:**\n    *   **Nonces (RN, RNa, RNhc, RNb):** Critical for freshness, intended to prevent replay attacks and ensure that each session is unique. Their proper generation (randomness, uniqueness) and usage in messages are key security aspects.\n    *   **Keys (PRx, PUx):** Public/Private key pairs are foundational for asymmetric cryptography, used for encryption, decryption, digital signatures, or key exchange. The description lists several keys for each role, implying a public key infrastructure or pre-shared public keys.\n    *   **SessionKey:** The desired outcome between DeviceA and DeviceB. How it's derived and confirmed by both parties is crucial.\n    *   **Identifiers (IDa, IDb, IDhc, IDdev, IDdevb, GIid, SIid):** Used to identify the participants. Proper binding of identities to keys and messages is essential for authentication.\n    *   **Other variables (DIsig, MATdiv, RIa, RIa1, Hdev, MATdivb, RIb, Timestamp):** These appear to be various parameters, potential routing information, signatures, or session-specific values. Their specific purpose and generation are not detailed.\n\n4.  **Messages:**\n    *   Messages are identified by names (V0, P1, P2, V1, V3, Q1). The flow is partially described by who sends/receives which message.\n    *   Messages are stated to be \"computed using\" cryptographic functions and variables, but their internal *structure* or *content* is completely missing.\n\n5.  **Claims:**\n    *   **Possession Claims:** Claims like \"possession of the SessionKey,\" \"possession of the secret PRedge,\" \"possession of the secret message\" (for DeviceB) are standard goals in authentication protocols. Proving possession without revealing the secret is typically done through challenge-response mechanisms or digital signatures.\n    *   **Agreement Claims (Niagree):** Agreement on shared session parameters (like nonces, SessionKey, etc.) ensures that both parties are on the same page and involved in the same session instance.\n    *   **Synchronization Claims (Nisynch):** Synchronization often refers to agreement on the state of the protocol or parameters like timestamps. The presence of a \"Timestamp\" variable for DeviceA suggests synchronization might involve time, which can be challenging in distributed systems.\n\n**Significant Limitations and Missing Information:**\n\nThe provided description is severely lacking in detail, making a proper security analysis impossible. The critical missing pieces include:\n\n1.  **No Protocol Steps/Sequence:** While message send/receive is listed, a clear, numbered sequence of message exchanges between the roles is not provided. The inferred flow (A->Edge, Edge->B, Edge->A, B->A, A->B) is only partially clear.\n2.  **No Message Structure/Content:** The most critical missing piece. We don't know *what* data is included in V0, P1, V1, etc., and how it is encrypted, hashed, or combined. For example, what is `V0`? Is it `E(PUedge, {IDa, RN, H(RN...)})`? Without this, we cannot analyze confidentiality, integrity, or authentication properties.\n3.  **Undefined Computation Details:** How are V0, P1, P2, Q1, etc., precisely \"computed\"? Which key is used with which function for each step? (e.g., Is `V0` encrypted with Edge's public key? Is `P1` a signature from Edge?)\n4.  **Session Key Derivation:** The description mentions SessionKey and POW, but the exact method for deriving the SessionKey and ensuring it's known *only* to A and B (and possibly Edge temporarily?) is not specified.\n5.  **Key Management & Trust Model:** How do the roles obtain and trust the public keys of other participants (PUa, PUb, PUedge)? Is there a Certificate Authority (CA) involved, or are keys pre-shared? This is fundamental to the security of public-key based protocols.\n6.  **Precise Claim Definitions:** While claims are listed, the *exact conditions* that constitute \"Niagree\" or \"Nisynch,\" or how these claims are *verified* by the other party, are not specified.\n7.  **Ambiguous Variable Usage:** Listing calculated messages (V0, Q1 etc.) as \"Constants\" and listing keys (PRa, PUa etc.) and session parameters (DIsigb, MATdivb) as both \"Fresh Variables\" and \"Constants\" for the same role indicates inconsistency or misunderstanding in the description's terminology.\n\n**Potential Security Concerns (Based on limited information):**\n\nWithout the message structure and flow, specific attacks cannot be identified. However, common vulnerabilities in protocols with intermediaries and multiple steps could include:\n\n*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks:** If authentication steps are weak or messages are not properly protected with authenticated encryption or signatures, an attacker could intercept and alter messages.\n*   **Replay Attacks:** While nonces are mentioned, their correct use within message structures and verification steps is crucial to prevent attackers from reusing old messages.\n*   **Session Key Compromise:** If the SessionKey derivation or exchange is flawed, an attacker might be able to compute or intercept it.\n*   **Impersonation:** If authentication mechanisms are weak, a malicious party could potentially impersonate DeviceA, DeviceB, or even Edge.\n*   **Lack of Forward Secrecy:** Depending on the SessionKey derivation from long-term keys, the compromise of a private key (e.g., PRedge) after the session could potentially compromise the SessionKey for past sessions.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe Fortified-Chain2 protocol description provides a high-level outline and lists components but is **insufficiently detailed** to perform a meaningful security analysis. The lack of defined message formats, sequence of steps, and specific cryptographic operation applications prevents evaluation of its security properties, authentication mechanisms, and key establishment process. To analyze this protocol properly, a complete specification including the content and structure of all exchanged messages, the exact steps performed by each role, the precise definition of how values are computed, and the underlying trust model is required."]], "SPDL-1/fourway-HSDDM05.spdl": [[false, "Okay, let's analyze the Four-Way Authentication Protocol description provided.\n\n### Analysis of the Four-Way Authentication Protocol\n\n#### Protocol Overview\n\nThe protocol aims to provide mutual authentication between Agent X and Agent Y using a shared secret key `pmk(X,Y)` and freshly generated nonces `x` and `y`. It's structured as a four-message exchange, culminating in the derivation of a shared session secret `SK = hash(pmk(X,Y), x, y)`.\n\n#### Security Analysis\n\n1.  **Mutual Authentication:**\n    *   The protocol attempts to achieve mutual authentication by having each party prove knowledge of the shared secret `pmk(X,Y)` via computations involving the session nonces `x` and `y`, included in the derived session key `SK`.\n    *   In Step 2, Agent Y sends `hash(SK, y, msg2)`. Agent X, knowing `pmk(X,Y)` and having received `x` (its own) and `y` (from Y), can compute `SK = hash(pmk(X,Y), x, y)`. X can then verify the hash received from Y. If it matches, X is assured that Y possesses `pmk(X,Y)` (or can derive `SK` using the correct `x` and `y`), thus authenticating Y to X. The inclusion of `y` ensures freshness for this proof from Y.\n    *   In Step 3, Agent X sends `hash(SK, x, msg3)`. Agent Y, knowing `pmk(X,Y)` and its nonces `x` (received) and `y` (its own), can also compute `SK`. Y verifies the hash received from X. If it matches, Y is assured that X possesses `pmk(X,Y)` and knows the session nonces, thus authenticating X to Y. The inclusion of `x` ensures freshness for this proof from X.\n    *   Step 4 serves as a final confirmation from Y to X, verifying that Y has successfully processed Msg3 and agreed on `SK`.\n    *   **Conclusion on Authentication:** Based on the assumption that `pmk(X,Y)` is a strong, secret key shared only between X and Y, the protocol appears to provide mutual authentication by demonstrating knowledge of `pmk(X,Y)` tied to the specific session nonces.\n\n2.  **Integrity:**\n    *   The use of hashes `hash(SK, ...)` protects the integrity of the handshake messages (or at least the parameters included in the hash).\n    *   Inclusion of the nonces (`y` in Msg2, `x` in Msg3) within the hash ensures that any modification of the nonces in transit by an attacker would be detected when the receiving party recalculates the expected hash using the received (and potentially modified) nonce.\n    *   Crucially, the inclusion of message identifiers (`msg2`, `msg3`, `msg4`) within the hashes prevents simple replay or reflection attacks where an attacker might try to confuse the protocol by sending a message from a different step.\n    *   **Conclusion on Integrity:** The hashing mechanism tied to the session key provides integrity protection for the specific fields included in the hashes during the authentication exchange.\n\n3.  **Confidentiality:**\n    *   The protocol description states \"Confidentiality: Ensures that the exchanged messages cannot be understood by unauthorized parties.\"\n    *   However, looking at the protocol steps, the messages themselves (`msg1`, `msg2`, `msg3`, `msg4` - assuming these are just labels or contain cleartext data) and the nonces (`x`, `y`) are sent in plaintext.\n    *   The *hashes* are confidential in the sense that computing or verifying them requires knowledge of `SK` (which requires `pmk(X,Y)`), but the hashes only prove knowledge of the secret or protect the integrity of parameters, they don't encrypt data.\n    *   The protocol *derives* a shared secret `SK`, which *could* then be used to encrypt subsequent communication data. But the protocol *as described* only covers the key establishment/authentication phase and does not provide confidentiality for data transfer itself.\n    *   **Conclusion on Confidentiality:** The protocol does *not* provide confidentiality for the authentication messages or any potential data carried within them. The derived session key `SK` *enables* subsequent confidential communication, but the protocol description doesn't cover that. The claim in the \"Security Goals\" is potentially misleading if interpreted as the protocol itself encrypting traffic.\n\n4.  **Freshness and Replay Protection:**\n    *   The use of fresh nonces `x` (generated by X) and `y` (generated by Y) is central to the protocol.\n    *   These nonces are incorporated into the derived session key `SK = hash(pmk(X,Y), x, y)`.\n    *   All subsequent verification hashes depend on `SK` and, in most cases, include the nonces themselves (`hash(SK, y, msg2)` and `hash(SK, x, msg3)`).\n    *   An attacker attempting to replay a set of old messages would use old values of `x` and `y`. When the legitimate recipient receives these and tries to compute the expected `SK` using the *current* session's fresh nonce (either the one they just generated or the one they just received and expect for *this* session), the computed `SK` will differ from the one used in the replayed hash. The verification will fail.\n    *   **Conclusion on Freshness:** Nonces `x` and `y` are effectively used to ensure freshness for each session and protect against replay attacks.\n\n5.  **The `unhash` Function and `pmk(X,Y)`:**\n    *   The variable `unhash` is listed but is **not used** in any of the protocol steps. This is confusing. Standard hash functions are designed to be one-way, making \"unhashing\" computationally infeasible. If `unhash` were a real, usable function, it would break the security of the protocol. Since it's unused, it's simply extraneous in the description.\n    *   The security of the protocol is entirely reliant on the secrecy and strength of `pmk(X,Y)`. If `pmk(X,Y)` is compromised, an attacker Eve could compute `SK` for any session where `x` and `y` are known (they are sent in the clear) and thus impersonate either X or Y to the other.\n    *   This protocol does *not* provide Perfect Forward Secrecy (PFS), meaning that if a long-term secret like `pmk(X,Y)` is compromised, past session keys (`SK` for previous sessions) derived using that `pmk` could be computed and used to decrypt recorded traffic (if subsequent traffic was encrypted using `SK`).\n\n6.  **Claims:**\n    *   Claim 1: \"Both agents claim that they have established a shared secret derived from the function `hash(pmk(X,Y), x, y)`.\" - This is accurate. The protocol steps lead both parties, upon successful verification, to the knowledge of `SK = hash(pmk(X,Y), x, y)`.\n    *   Claim 2: \"They also claim that they agree to the identity of one another (Niagree).\" - This is also accurate. Successful verification of the hashes based on `SK` confirms the other party's identity (as the holder of `pmk(X,Y)`) for this specific session defined by `x` and `y`.\n\n#### Summary of Strengths\n\n*   Provides mutual authentication based on a shared secret.\n*   Uses nonces effectively to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks.\n*   Uses message identifiers in hashes to prevent cross-protocol and simple reflection attacks.\n*   Derives a fresh session key (`SK`) for each session, which can be used for subsequent secure communication.\n\n#### Summary of Weaknesses/Points of Concern\n\n*   The protocol itself does *not* provide confidentiality for the authentication messages or subsequent data transfer (it only establishes a key *for* that purpose). The claim of confidentiality might be misinterpreted.\n*   The presence of the unused and conceptually problematic `unhash` variable is confusing and raises questions about the protocol's design principles if it were intended for use.\n*   Lack of Perfect Forward Secrecy; compromise of `pmk(X,Y)` compromises past sessions.\n*   Reliance solely on a pre-shared or managed `pmk(X,Y)` means its security is paramount.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe Four-Way Authentication Protocol, as described (ignoring the unused `unhash` function), is a standard pattern for mutual authentication based on a shared secret key. It effectively uses nonces and hashing to provide mutual authentication, integrity for the handshake parameters, and protection against replay attacks. It successfully establishes a fresh session key for potential subsequent confidential communication. However, it does not provide confidentiality for the authentication exchange itself and lacks Perfect Forward Secrecy.

We define the public communication channel `c`, the long-term secret keys (`skI`, `skR`), and the initial secret value `sec_I`. The public keys derived from the secret keys (`pk(skI)`, `pk(skR)`) are also explicitly made free, representing that public keys are published.\n5.  **`query secret`:** These are the standard ProVerif queries to check if a specific piece of data (`sec_I`, `n_R`) can be learned by the attacker.\n6.  **`let initiator(...)` and `let responder(...)`:** These define the processes for each role. They take as arguments the necessary keys and values they need at the start of their execution.\n    *   Inside the processes, `new name: type` generates a fresh, unique value for each session (used here for the Responder's nonce `n_R`).\n    *   `out c(message)` represents sending a message on channel `c`.\n    *   `in c(variable)` represents receiving a message from channel `c` and binding it to `variable`.\n    *   `let pattern = value in ...` is used to perform operations like decryption or parsing messages. If the `pattern` doesn't match the `value` (e.g., decryption fails, or the received message isn't a pair), the process branch terminates.\n7.  **`process ...`:** This block sets up the initial state and runs the main processes.\n    *   `! out(c, pkI); ! out(c, pkR);` explicitly makes the public keys known on the channel (attacker can intercept them).\n    *   `! initiator(...)` and `! responder(...)` start potentially many sessions of each role running concurrently.\n\nThis model captures the described message flow and allows ProVerif to analyze its security properties, particularly the secrecy of `sec_I` and `n_R`.\n\nTo run this in ProVerif, save it as a `.pv` file and open it with the ProVerif executable.

Here's an analysis based on the text:\n\nThis document describes a specific model or implementation of the IKEv2 protocol, likely simplified or structured in a particular way for formal analysis or verification, given the mention of an \"SPDL file.\"\n\nHere are the key points and observations:\n\n1.  **Structure and Purpose:** The description breaks down the protocol into distinct conceptual roles (DH, SWAP, E) in addition to the standard Initiator (I) and Responder (R). This suggests a decomposition of the protocol's logic into sub-processes or functions within the model, rather than purely describing the on-the-wire message flow as defined in RFCs. The goal is clearly to establish a secure channel, authenticated, with confidentiality and integrity.\n\n2.  **Roles:**\n    *   **Standard I/R:** The Initiator (I) and Responder (R) roles align with the standard IKEv2 participants. Their message exchanges (1-4) seem to correspond to the initial SA-INIT (1, 2) and the subsequent AUTH (3, 4) exchanges, although the descriptions of the message contents are highly simplified (\"nonce and security association,\" \"message containing a MAC\").\n    *   **Conceptual Roles (DH, SWAP, E):** These roles appear to represent specific *functions* or *phases* executed *by* the Initiator and Responder during the protocol run.\n        *   `DH`: Focuses on the Diffie-Hellman exchange. This is a core part of the SA-INIT phase (Messages 1 and 2).\n        *   `SWAP`: Implies a back-and-forth exchange related to key derivation and potentially message authentication. KDF and MAC are central to deriving keys and protecting the AUTH phase (Messages 3 and 4).\n        *   `E` (Executability): This role is described as an \"intermediary.\" In a formal model, this might represent the environment, the communication channel, or a process that ensures messages are correctly processed and relayed between I and R. The messages E1-E4 don't map directly to I/R messages 1-4; they seem to describe interactions *involving* message validation (MAC checks) and potentially internal state updates managed by this \"intermediary\" process within the model.\n\n3.  **Cryptographic Functions:** The functions listed (g, h, MAC, PRF, KDF) are standard cryptographic primitives used in IKEv2. The generic labels (`g`, `h`) for hash functions are common in formal models. MAC, PRF, and KDF are essential for message integrity, key derivation, and entropy expansion.\n\n4.  **Message Exchanges:**\n    *   The message flows defined for the conceptual roles (DH, SWAP, E) are abstract and task-focused (e.g., \"sends a hashed value,\" \"accepts a KDF-generated message\") rather than detailing the exact packet structure.\n    *   The messages defined for the Initiator (1-4) and Responder (1-4) align more closely with the actual IKEv2 exchange sequence (SA-INIT: 1, 2; AUTH: 3, 4), but again, the content descriptions are minimal.\n\n5.  **Claims:** The claims (Running, SKR, Alive, Weak Agreement, Commit) are standard security properties and states often modeled and verified in formal analysis tools (like those using SPDL).\n    *   `Running`: The party is active in the protocol.\n    *   `SKR (Session Key Ready)`: Indicates the successful derivation of session keys. This is a critical point in the protocol.\n    *   `Alive`: A liveness property, confirming the participant hasn't terminated unexpectedly.\n    *   `Weak Agreement`: Indicates that the parties agree on the established session parameters (like keys, SAs). \"Weak\" usually implies agreement on the *data* exchanged, but not necessarily on *who* they exchanged it with (strong agreement includes authentication).\n    *   `Commit`: Signifies that the party has finalized its state for this session and is ready to proceed, typically after authentication.\n\n6.  **Security Associations (SAs):** Mentioning SA1, SA2, SA3 suggests that the model handles multiple security associations or different types of SAs, which is accurate for IKEv2 (IKE SA, Child SAs).\n\n**In Summary:**\n\nThis description provides a layered view of an IKEv2 implementation model. The standard Initiator/Responder roles handle the overall message flow (1-4), while the conceptual DH, SWAP, and Executability roles likely represent internal processing steps or functions involved in the key exchange, key derivation, message processing, and validation within that model. The focus on specific claims highlights that this description is intended for verifying security properties using formal methods, where the abstract roles and messages help in structuring the protocol's logic for analysis.

We'll clarify the message flows and the purpose of each step from the perspective of the SPDL specification.\n\n### SPDL Protocol Descriptions\n\nHere are descriptive contents for the provided SPDL protocols:\n\n#### 1. Protocol: `@keysymm-21`\n\n*   **Derived from SPDL Model:** This description is based on the SPDL specification for the protocol named `@keysymm-21`.\n*   **Description:**\n    The `@keysymm-21` protocol is a symmetric key-based authentication scheme designed primarily for **unilateral authentication of party A to party B**. It is modeled after principles found in the ISO/IEC 9798 standard but structured as a one-pass flow *from A's perspective for authentication*. The protocol allows the initiator, Role A, to securely transmit a nonce and a ticket to the responder, Role B, while simultaneously proving its identity and liveness using a shared symmetric key.\n    The core authentication happens in the message sent by A to B, which B validates. While the SPDL might show B sending a subsequent message, the primary authentication mechanism defined *by A's first message* is unilateral A-to-B authentication.\n\n*   **Roles:**\n    *   **Role A (Initiator):**\n        *   Acts as the authenticating party.\n        *   Generates fresh data: a nonce (`T`) and arbitrary data in a ticket (`Text`).\n        *   Encrypts this data (`T`, `Text`, and potentially A's identity) using the pre-shared symmetric key `k(A,B)` shared with B.\n        *   Sends the encrypted message to B. This message serves as A's assertion of identity and claim of liveness.\n        *   Receives a message from B (as defined in the SPDL transitions), which may contain encrypted data from B.\n    *   **Role B (Responder/Verifier):**\n        *   Acts as the verifying party for A's authentication.\n        *   Possesses the pre-shared symmetric key `k(A,B)`.\n        *   Receives the initial message from A.\n        *   Attempts to decrypt A's message using `k(A,B)`. Successful decryption validates that the message originated from A (or someone possessing `k(A,B)`).\n        *   Verifies the freshness of the nonce (`T`) to protect against replay attacks.\n        *   Processes the ticket data (`Text`).\n        *   (As per SPDL) May also generate its own nonce and ticket and send a message back to A, encrypted with the shared key `k(B,A)` (which is often the same key as `k(A,B)`), potentially for secure data exchange or as part of a larger communication pattern, but this response is not the primary mechanism for *B authenticating to A* within the core definition of A's unilateral authentication.\n\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   **Unilateral Authentication (A to B):** The primary goal is for A to prove its identity and send data securely to B in a single step from A's side.\n    *   **Symmetric Key Cryptography:** Relies on a shared secret key between A and B.\n    *   **One-Pass (for A's Authentication):** A sends one message that allows B to authenticate A.\n    *   **Freshness:** Uses a nonce (`T`) generated by A to mitigate replay attacks. B is expected to verify this nonce's freshness.\n    *   **Data Inclusion:** Allows arbitrary data (`Text`) to be securely transmitted along with the authentication.\n\n#### 2. Protocol: `isoiec-9798-2-1`\n\n*   **Derived from SPDL Model:** This description is based on the SPDL specification for the protocol named `isoiec-9798-2-1`.\n*   **Description:**\n    The `isoiec-9798-2-1` protocol is a **two-pass symmetric key-based mutual authentication protocol** specified in the ISO/IEC 9798-2 standard, likely Scheme 1. It is designed to allow two parties, A and B, to authenticate each other simultaneously and establish confidence in each other's liveness using a shared symmetric key. The protocol involves a challenge-response exchange where each party proves knowledge of the shared secret by successfully processing a challenge from the other. The SPDL model captures the state transitions and security claims associated with this exchange.\n\n*   **Roles:**\n    *   **Role A (Initiator):**\n        *   Initiates the authentication process.\n        *   Generates a fresh challenge/nonce (`TNA`).\n        *   Generates additional data or context in two tickets (`Text1`, `Text2`).\n        *   Forms the first message to B, typically including publicly visible data (`Text2`) and an encrypted component. The encrypted part contains A's challenge (`TNA`), B's identity (to prevent reflection attacks), and potentially other data (`Text1`), all encrypted under the shared key `k(A,B)`.\n        *   Claims its intent to run the protocol and asserts its identity and the generated nonce (e.g., using SPDL claims like `Running(A,B,TNA)`).\n        *   Receives the second message from B.\n        *   Verifies B's response to complete the mutual authentication, ensuring B is live and possesses the shared key (by checking if B's response correctly incorporates A's challenge `TNA`).\n    *   **Role B (Responder):**\n        *   Responds to A's initiation.\n        *   Possesses the pre-shared symmetric key `k(A,B)`.\n        *   Receives A's first message.\n        *   Decrypts the encrypted component using `k(A,B)`. Successful decryption provides confidence that the message came from A.\n        *   Validates A's challenge (`TNA`) for freshness and potentially verifies A's identity.\n        *   Generates its own response message. This message typically includes A's nonce (`TNA`) processed or re-encrypted with the shared key, proving B's liveness and knowledge of the key to A.\n        *   Sends this response message to A.\n        *   Claims its successful verification of A and commitment to the session (e.g., using SPDL claims like `Commit(B,A,TNA)`). Asserts properties like both parties being alive (`Alive(A)`, `Alive(B)`) and reaching a weak agreement on the session (`Weakagree(A,B,TNA)`).\n\n*   **Key Features:**\n    *   **Mutual Authentication (A to B, and B to A):** Both parties authenticate each other during the protocol run.\n    *   **Symmetric Key Cryptography:** Relies on a shared secret key between A and B.\n    *   **Two-Pass Exchange:** The authentication is completed over two messages (A to B, then B to A).\n    *   **Challenge-Response:** Uses nonces (`TNA`) as challenges to prove liveness and knowledge of the shared key.\n    *   **Freshness:** Nonces prevent replay and reflection attacks.\n    *   **Claims (in SPDL):** Explicitly modeled states and assertions (`Running`, `Commit`, `Alive`, `Weakagree`) used in formal verification to reason about the protocol's security properties and state transitions.\n\n### Summary\n\nIn essence, the `@keysymm-21` protocol is a more specialized scheme focused on enabling party A to authenticate itself unilaterally to party B in a single authentication step, while `isoiec-9798-2-1` implements a standard, robust two-pass exchange for mutual authentication where both parties verify each other. Both protocols leverage symmetric key cryptography and nonces for security, but differ in their authentication goals and the structure of the message exchange.

This authenticates R to S and ensures the confidentiality of the information sent to S.\n\n3.  **S -> R:** `{ nr, Id(I), { ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis }Krs`\n    *   The Server receives `{ nr, ni, Id(I), kir }Krs`.\n    *   S decrypts the message using `Krs`, obtaining `nr`, `ni`, `Id(I)`, and `kir`.\n    *   S constructs a \"ticket\" for the Initiator: `{ ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis`. This ticket contains the session key `kir`, I's nonce `ni` (for freshness), and R's identifier `Id(R)`, all encrypted with `Kis` (the key shared between I and S). Only I will be able to decrypt this ticket.\n    *   S then sends a message back to R, encrypted with `Krs`. This message contains `nr` (for R to verify freshness of S's response), `Id(I)` (confirmation for R), and the ticket for I.\n\n4.  **R -> I:** `{ ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis`\n    *   The Responder receives `{ nr, Id(I), { ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis }Krs`.\n    *   R decrypts the message using `Krs`.\n    *   R verifies `nr` matches the one sent in Step 2, confirming the message is a fresh response from S to its request.\n    *   R verifies `Id(I)` matches the initiator it's interacting with.\n    *   R extracts the ticket `{ ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis`. *Note: R cannot decrypt this ticket as it does not know `Kis`.*\n    *   R forwards this ticket to the Initiator.\n\n5.  **I Processing:**\n    *   The Initiator receives `{ ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis`.\n    *   I decrypts the message using `Kis`, obtaining `ni`, `kir`, and `Id(R)`.\n    *   I verifies that the nonce `ni` matches the nonce sent in Step 1. This confirms that the message is fresh and corresponds to its original request.\n    *   If verification is successful, I accepts `kir` as the shared session key with `Id(R)`.\n\n**Security Analysis based on Description:**\n\n*   **Confidentiality of `kir`:**\n    *   `kir` is sent from R to S encrypted with `Krs` (Step 2). Only R and S know `Krs`.\n    *   `kir` is sent from S to R encrypted within the ticket `{ ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis`, which is then encrypted with `Krs` (Step 3). Only S and R know `Krs`, and only S and I know `Kis`. An eavesdropper cannot obtain `kir`. R receives the ticket but cannot decrypt it.\n    *   `kir` is sent from R to I encrypted within the ticket `{ ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis` (Step 4). Only I and S know `Kis`. An eavesdropper cannot obtain `kir`. R forwards the ticket but cannot decrypt it.\n    *   *Conclusion:* The protocol appears to ensure that `kir` is kept confidential from passive eavesdroppers and from the Responder (R) before it receives the keying material from S (though R generates the key in this version, it receives confirmation and the ticket via S) and sends the ticket to I. The claim that `kir` is secret *between I and R* holds against external attackers, but S necessarily knows `kir`. This is typical for KDC-based protocols.\n\n*   **Freshness:**\n    *   `ni` (Initiator's nonce): Generated by I, sent to R, included in messages to S, and returned to I within the ticket. I verifies the returned `ni` to ensure the message is fresh and relates to its current request.\n    *   `nr` (Responder's nonce): Generated by R, sent to S, and returned to R in S's response. R verifies the returned `nr` to ensure S's response is fresh and relates to R's request.\n    *   *Conclusion:* The nonces provide strong freshness guarantees against replay attacks for the key establishment messages between I and R (via the ticket) and between R and S.\n\n*   **Authentication:**\n    *   I authenticates S and R: When I successfully decrypts the ticket `{ ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis` using `Kis` and verifies `ni`, I is assured that the message originated from S (as only S knows `Kis` other than I) and contains the session key `kir` intended for communication with `Id(R)`. I trusts S to correctly identify R.\n    *   R authenticates S: When R successfully decrypts `{ nr, Id(I), { ni, kir, Id(R) }Kis }Krs` using `Krs` and verifies `nr`, R is assured the message originated from S (as only S knows `Krs` other than R).\n    *   S authenticates R: S authenticates R by successfully decrypting `{ nr, ni, Id(I), kir }Krs` using `Krs`.\n    *   Authentication of I to R: This protocol step description does not explicitly include I authenticating *to* R in a way R can verify *before* contacting S. R receives `ni` from I, sends `Id(I)` to S, and relies on S providing a ticket encrypted with `Kis`. R forwards the ticket. R only knows I is the *intended* recipient because S provided a ticket encrypted with `Kis` for `Id(I)`. Mutual authentication *between I and R* using the newly established key `kir` would typically happen in subsequent steps (not described here), using MACs or encryption with `kir` to prove possession of the key.\n\n*   **Key Confirmation:** The described steps do not include explicit confirmation that both I and R are in possession of the established key `kir` and are ready to use it. This is typically done after the key establishment phase.\n\n*   **Role of the Server (S):** S acts as a trusted third party. It knows `Kis` and `Krs` and learns the session key `kir`. It facilitates the secure exchange of `kir` information wrapped in keys known only to the intended recipient (I gets `kir` wrapped with `Kis`). S is critical for the security of the protocol.\n\n**Limitations/Assumptions:**\n\n*   Trust in Server (S) is paramount. S knows all session keys it helps establish.\n*   The security relies on the confidentiality and integrity of the shared long-term keys `Kis` and `Krs`. Compromise of these keys would allow impersonation or session key compromise (no forward secrecy).\n*   As noted, the provided steps don't explicitly show mutual authentication between I and R using `kir`, nor explicit key confirmation. These would be necessary for a complete secure channel setup.\n*   This variation has R generating `kir`. S trusts R's generation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe described protocol mechanism, likely from ISO/IEC 11770-2, is a standard KDC-based symmetric key establishment method. It effectively uses symmetric encryption and nonces to ensure the confidentiality of the established session key (`kir`) from eavesdroppers and provides freshness guarantees. It relies on a trusted Server (S) that shares long-term keys with the participants. While it provides authenticated key delivery from S to I and S to R, the provided description omits the subsequent steps needed for explicit mutual authentication and key confirmation between I and R using the new session key `kir`."]], "SPDL-1/KAS1.spdl": [[false, "Okay, let's analyze the provided description of the KEA+ protocol.\n\nBased on the description:\n\n**Protocol Flow as Described:**\n\n1.  **I -> R:** `g1(x)` (where `x` is I's nonce)\n2.  **R -> I:** `g1(y)` (where `y` is R's nonce)\n\n*(Note: The \"compromise\" messages are mentioned but appear to be internal state changes rather than network messages, so they are excluded from the network flow)*\n\n**Key Derivation as Described:**\n\n*   **Initiator (I) computes SKR:** `h1(beta, R_pub_key, x)`\n    *   The description says `beta` is received from R. According to R's steps, R sends `g1(y)`. So, `beta` is likely intended to be `g1(y)`.\n    *   Therefore, I computes: `SKR_I = h1(g1(y), R_pub_key, x)`\n\n*   **Responder (R) computes SKR:** `h1(I_pub_key, y, alpha)`\n    *   The description says `alpha` is received from I. According to I's steps, I sends `g1(x)`. So, `alpha` is `g1(x)`.\n    *   Therefore, R computes: `SKR_R = h1(I_pub_key, y, g1(x))`\n\n**Analysis and Issues:**\n\nBased on the provided description, the KEA+ protocol has several critical issues and ambiguities:\n\n1.  **Failure to Derive a Common Shared Secret:**\n    *   The most significant flaw is that the computation for `SKR` is different for the Initiator and the Responder.\n    *   I computes `h1(g1(y), R_pub_key, x)`.\n    *   R computes `h1(I_pub_key, y, g1(x))`.\n    *   Assuming `h1` is a standard cryptographic hash function (sensitive to input order), the inputs to `h1` are different for I and R.\n    *   I's inputs: `g1(y)`, `R_pub_key`, `x`\n    *   R's inputs: `I_pub_key`, `y`, `g1(x)`\n    *   Unless the specific functions `h1` and `g1` and the relationship between public keys, nonces, and their transformations somehow magically make these hash computations yield the same output despite different inputs and orders (which is contrary to standard cryptographic practice for hash functions), **I and R will compute different shared secret keys.** This protocol, *as described*, fails its primary goal of establishing a shared secret.\n\n2.  **Ambiguity of `g1` and `g2`:**\n    *   `g1` is described only as a \"public function\" or \"transformation\". The overview mentions \"Diffie-Hellman key exchanges\", but the steps do not show the typical DH exponentiation (`g^x`, `g^y`) or key derivation (`(g^y)^x`). If `g1(x)` *is* intended to be `g^x` for some generator `g`, the description is misleadingly vague. However, even if interpreted as DH, the final key derivation using `h1` (as shown above) still results in different keys.\n    *   `g2` is mentioned in the \"Security Considerations\" list of cryptographic primitives (`h1`, `g1`, and `g2`) but is never used anywhere in the protocol steps described. Its purpose is completely unknown from this document.\n\n3.  **Inconsistency in Initiator's Key Computation:**\n    *   The description for the Initiator says `beta` is \"expected to be generated from R\u2019s secret key and its own nonce\". This phrasing (\"secret key\") is confusing. If `beta` is `g1(y)`, and `g1` is just a public function of the nonce `y`, it doesn't directly involve R's *secret* key in the way that a DH `g^y` (where `y` is the secret exponent) or a signature would. This adds to the ambiguity of `g1` and `beta`.\n\n4.  **Ambiguous Role of Public Keys:**\n    *   Public keys (`I_pub_key`, `R_pub_key`) are used in the *final* key derivation hash. This implies they are known beforehand, likely through some public key infrastructure (PKI) or prior arrangement. However, the protocol description doesn't detail how these public keys are obtained, verified, or linked to the current protocol run or the values `g1(x)`/`g1(y)`.\n    *   The public keys are included in the *key derivation*, but the description doesn't show how they contribute to *authentication* during the message exchange itself. An attacker could potentially intercept and substitute `g1(x)` and `g1(y)` values without detection, leading to a potential Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, as there's no signing or cryptographic proof linking these ephemeral values to the claimed public keys or identities *during* the exchange. A standard authenticated key exchange would typically involve signing the ephemeral values with the party's private key.\n\n5.  **The \"Compromise\" Message:**\n    *   Sending a \"compromise\" message *to oneself* is highly unusual in the context of a protocol description defining messages exchanged between parties. It seems to describe an internal state change (like transitioning to an \"in-progress\" state) rather than a message transmitted over the network. Including it in the \"Roles and Messages\" section alongside network messages is confusing.\n\n**Strengths (Based purely on description's stated intent):**\n\n*   **Use of Nonces:** The use of fresh nonces (`x`, `y`) is a good practice for ensuring freshness and preventing simple replay attacks on the message values themselves (`g1(x)`, `g1(y)`).\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe KEA+ protocol, as described, contains fundamental flaws that prevent it from achieving its stated goals. Most critically, the key derivation steps for the Initiator and Responder result in different computed keys, meaning they cannot establish a shared secret. The description also suffers from significant ambiguities regarding the nature of the functions `g1` and `g2`, the role and usage of public keys for authentication during the exchange, and the purpose of the \"compromise\" message.\n\nBased on this description, the protocol is broken and would not be suitable for secure authenticated key exchange.

The protocol involves four key roles interacting through a sequence of message exchanges to establish secure, authenticated communication between a client and a service.\n\n### 1. Roles\n\nThe protocol defines the following principal roles:\n\n*   **Client (C):** Initiates the protocol to obtain access to services. Possesses a long-term secret key shared with the Key Distribution Center (`kck`).\n*   **Key Distribution Center (K):** Acts as the Authentication Service (AS). Shares a long-term secret key with the Client (`kck`) and with the Ticket Granting Server (T) (`k_kt`). Responsible for the initial authentication of the client and issuing the Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) and the initial session key (`AKey`).\n*   **Ticket Granting Server (T):** Acts as the Ticket Granting Service (TGS). Shares a long-term secret key with the Key Distribution Center (K) (`k_kt`) and with Service Providers (S) (`k_ks` or `k_s` - implied as K or T having keys for S). Validates TGTs and issues Service Tickets (ST) and service-specific session keys (`SKey`).\n*   **Service Provider (S):** Provides a service. Shares a long-term secret key with the Ticket Granting Server (T) (`k_ks` or `k_s` - implied as T having keys for S). Validates Service Tickets and Authenticator information to grant access.\n\n### 2. Protocol Steps (Message Flow)\n\nThe protocol proceeds through a series of message exchanges:\n\n*   **Message 1 (C -> K):**\n    *   Purpose: Client requests a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for the Ticket Granting Server (T).\n    *   Content: Request for T, Nonce `n1`.\n    *   Term: `T, n1`\n\n*   **Message 2 (K -> C):**\n    *   Purpose: KDC responds with the TGT and an initial session key (`AKey`) for C to communicate with T.\n    *   Content: Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT), Session Key (`AKey`) encrypted with Client's key (`kck`), Nonce `n1`. The TGT itself contains information like C's identity, T's identity, timestamp, and `AKey`, encrypted using K's key for T (`k_kt`).\n    *   Term: `encrypt(kck, {TGT, AKey, n1})`\n\n*   **Message 3 (C -> T):**\n    *   Purpose: Client presents the TGT to T and requests a Service Ticket (ST) for Service S.

Claims\n\nThe SPDL analysis includes claims regarding the security properties achieved when certain principals are considered honest:\n\n*   **Claim 1:** `claim(C, Reachable, K)` - If Client (C) and Key Distribution Center (K) are honest, the initial exchange (Message 1 and 2) is reachable by C.\n*   **Claim 2:** `claim(C, Confidentiality, AKey)` - If Client (C), Key Distribution Center (K), and Ticket Granting Server (T) are honest, the session key `AKey` remains confidential to these parties.\n*   **Claim 3:** `claim(C, Reachable, S)` - If Client (C), Key Distribution Center (K), and Service Provider (S) are honest, the final service access exchange (Messages 5 and 6) is reachable by C.\n*   **Claim 4:** `claim(C, Confidentiality, SKey)` - If Client (C), Key Distribution Center (K), and Service Provider (S) are honest, the service session key `SKey` remains confidential between C and S.\n*   **Additional Claims by T:** The SPDL also specifies claims made *by* the Ticket Granting Server (T) regarding the confidentiality and/or authenticity of `AKey` and `SKey` under specific honesty assumptions (details not fully specified in the provided description but noted as present in the SPDL).\n\n### 4. Security Properties\n\nBased on the protocol structure and analysis, the key security properties are:\n\n*   **Authentication:** Mutual authentication is established at each stage (C-K, C-T, C-S) through the use of shared keys and encrypted authenticators/messages. Only entities possessing the correct session keys (derived from successful ticket exchanges) can participate in subsequent steps.\n*   **Key Freshness:** New session keys (`AKey` and `SKey`) are generated for each session (or ticket lifetime), preventing replay attacks using old session keys. Nonces (`n1`, `n2`) and implicitly timestamps within tickets/authenticators contribute to freshness verification.\n*   **Confidentiality:** Communication using session keys (`AKey`, `SKey`) ensures that messages exchanged in later steps (Messages 3-6) are protected from eavesdropping by unauthorized parties.\n\n### 5. Conclusion\n\nThe Kerberos protocol, as represented by this SPDL specification, provides a well-defined mechanism for secure authentication and key distribution in a network environment. By leveraging a trusted Key Distribution Center and a staged approach to ticket granting, it enables clients to securely obtain session keys for confidential and authenticated communication with various services without requiring direct sharing of long-term secrets between every client and every service. The SPDL analysis confirms reachability and key confidentiality under specified honesty assumptions, validating core security goals of the protocol.\n\n---"]], "SPDL-1/localclaims-breaker.spdl": [[false, "Okay, here is the Localclaims Breaker Protocol described in a structured format suitable for analysis.\n\n---\n\n### Localclaims Breaker Protocol Specification\n\n**Protocol Name:** Localclaims Breaker\n\n**Roles:**\n*   **Initiator (I)**\n*   **Responder (R)**\n\n**Keying:**\n*   Each principal P (I or R) has a unique public key `pk(P)` and corresponding secret key `sk(P)`.\n*   The keys are related by the `inversekeys` property, meaning `sk(P)` is the inverse of `pk(P)` for decryption.\n\n**Nonces:**\n*   `ni`: A fresh nonce generated by the Initiator.\n*   `nr`: A fresh nonce generated by the Responder.\n*   `x`: A fresh nonce generated by the Responder.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n*   Public keys `pk(I)` and `pk(R)` are known to the communication partners (e.g., via a trusted source or prior exchange).\n*   Encryption notation `{Data}Key` means `Data` is encrypted using `Key`.

The protocol relies on pre-shared long-term keys and nonce values to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks.\n\n#### Goal:\nTo establish a fresh, shared symmetric session key (`Kir`) between the Initiator (I) and the Responder (R).\n\n#### Assumptions:\n*   The Server (S) is a trusted third party.\n*   The Initiator (I) shares a long-term secret key (`Kis`) with the Server (S).\n*   The Responder (R) shares a long-term secret key (`Krs`) with the Server (S).\n*   These long-term keys (`Kis`, `Krs`) are known only to the respective party and the Server (S).\n\n#### Roles:\n*   **Initiator (I)**: The party requesting a secure session with the Responder.\n*   **Responder (R)**: The party with whom the Initiator wishes to establish a secure session.\n*   **Server (S)**: The trusted third party responsible for generating and distributing session keys.\n\n#### Notation:\n*   `A -> B: Message`: Party A sends `Message` to Party B.\n*   `{Message}K`: The `Message` encrypted with key `K`.\n*   `Ni`: Nonce generated by the Initiator (I).\n*   `Nr`: Nonce generated by the Responder (R).\n*   `Kir`: The session key generated by the Server (S) for communication between I and R.\n*   `Kis`: The long-term key shared between I and S.\n*   `Krs`: The long-term key shared between R and S.\n\n#### Protocol Steps (Messages):\n\nThe protocol proceeds in 5 messages:\n\n1.  **I -> S: I, R, Ni**\n    *   The Initiator (I) initiates the protocol by sending a plain text message to the Server (S).\n    *   This message contains I's identity, R's identity, and a fresh nonce (`Ni`) generated by I.\n    *   *Purpose:* I requests a session key for communication with R and includes `Ni` to uniquely identify this request and ensure the server's response is fresh.\n\n2.  **S -> I: {Kir, R, Ni}Kis, {Kir, I}Krs**\n    *   The Server (S) receives the request. It verifies I's identity (implicitly, as it shares `Kis`).\n    *   S generates a unique session key (`Kir`) for I and R.\n    *   S constructs two encrypted messages:\n        *   A message for I: `{Kir, R, Ni}Kis`. This block is encrypted with `Kis` (I's key shared with S). It contains the session key (`Kir`), the identity of the intended recipient (R), and I's nonce (`Ni`).\n        *   A \"ticket\" for R: `{Kir, I}Krs`. This block is encrypted with `Krs` (R's key shared with S). It contains the session key (`Kir`) and the identity of the initiator (I).\n    *   S sends *both* encrypted blocks back to I.\n    *   *Purpose:* S provides the session key `Kir` to I in a way only I can decrypt (using `Kis`) and provides a ticket for R (encrypted with `Krs`) containing the session key `Kir`. The presence of `Ni` within I's block assures I that this response is fresh and corresponds to its specific request.\n\n3.  **I -> R: {Kir, I}Krs**\n    *   The Initiator (I) receives the two encrypted blocks from S. I decrypts `{Kir, R, Ni}Kis` using its key `Kis` to retrieve the session key (`Kir`), R's identity (confirming it's for the right party), and `Ni` (confirming freshness).\n    *   I cannot decrypt the second block `{Kir, I}Krs` because it's encrypted with `Krs`, which I doesn't know. However, I knows this block is intended for R.\n    *   I forwards this second block (the \"ticket\") to the Responder (R).\n    *   *Purpose:* I passes the session key (`Kir`) to R securely via the ticket provided by S. This message also serves as the first communication from I to R in this session setup.\n\n4.  **R -> I: {Nr}Kir**\n    *   The Responder (R) receives the ticket `{Kir, I}Krs` from I.\n    *   R decrypts the ticket using its key `Krs` to obtain the session key (`Kir`) and I's identity (confirming who initiated the session).\n    *   To assure I that R is live and has the session key, R generates a fresh nonce (`Nr`).\n    *   R sends `Nr` back to I, encrypted using the newly established session key `Kir`.\n    *   *Purpose:* R confirms receipt and successful decryption of the session key. `Nr` is a challenge to I, requiring I to prove it also possesses `Kir`.\n\n5.  **I -> R: {Nr-1}Kir**\n    *   The Initiator (I) receives `{Nr}Kir` from R.\n    *   I decrypts the message using the session key `Kir` to obtain `Nr`.\n    *   To assure R that I is live, has the session key, and has processed R's challenge, I performs a simple transformation on `Nr` (e.g., subtracts 1, `Nr-1`) and sends it back to R, encrypted with `Kir`.\n    *   *Purpose:* I proves to R that it is live and possesses the session key `Kir` by correctly responding to R's challenge (`Nr`).\n\n#### Outcome:\nUpon successful completion of these steps, both I and R possess the shared session key `Kir`.\n*   I is assured `Kir` is fresh because it received `Ni` back from S in Message 2, linked to `Kir`. I is assured R is live and has `Kir` by R's correct use of `Kir` in encrypting `Nr` (Message 4) and I's ability to respond correctly in Message 5.\n*   R is assured `Kir` is fresh because it was encrypted by S using `Krs`. R is assured I is live and possesses `Kir` by I's correct use of `Kir` in responding to the `Nr` challenge (Message 5).\n\n#### Known Issue (Replay Attack):\nA significant vulnerability exists in this protocol. If an attacker (A) obtains a copy of an old session key `Kir_old` and captures an old Message 3 (`{Kir_old, I}Krs`), A can replay this message to R. R, believing it to be a new session initiation from I, will accept `Kir_old` and proceed with Message 4 (`{Nr}Kir_old`).

We define the `mac` and `check_mac` functions to model the MAC mechanism (ProVerif's `check_mac` ensures that `check_mac(k, x, mac(k, x))` reduces to `x`, simulating successful verification). The `kdf` function models the Key Derivation Function.\n2.  **Constants:** We define public identifiers for the roles (`GS_ID`, `SAT_ID`) and constant values for the SA properties, SA confirmation, commands, and ACKs. Message type constants (`type_Rb`, etc.) are used to distinguish messages on the channel.\n3.  **Shared Key:** `k_GS_Sat` is declared. In the main process, we restrict its initial knowledge to the participants using `let k_GS_Sat = k_GS_Sat in (...)`. This models it as a pre-shared secret.\n4.  **Events:** Events are strategically placed in the processes to mark specific points in the protocol execution.\n    *   `auth_*`: Indicate when a party believes it has authenticated the other.\n    *   `key_*`: Indicate when a party has derived the session key.\n    *   `sync_*`: Indicate when a party is ready to proceed to the command phase.\n    These events include relevant data like identities, nonces, and the session key, which are used in the correspondence queries.\n5.  **Processes (`processGS`, `processSat`):** These functions define the behavior of each role.\n    *   They take the shared key and IDs as input.\n    *   `new` is used to generate fresh nonces (`rb`, `ra`).\n    *   `out(c, ...)` sends data on the public channel `c`.\n    *   `in(c, ...)` receives data from the public channel `c`, often using pattern matching (`let ... = ... in ...`) to bind received values.\n    *   `if check_mac(...) then ... else ...` models the MAC verification step. The process only continues if the check passes.\n    *   The processes strictly follow the protocol steps, including the two command/ACK cycles.\n6.  **Secrecy Query:** `query secret ks_val.` checks if the session key `ks` (exposed by `let ks_val = ks in 0` in the Sat process) is ever revealed to the adversary. `query secret k_GS_Sat.` checks if the initial shared key is revealed (it shouldn't be if restricted correctly).\n7.  **Correspondence Queries:** These queries use the defined events to check for authentication, agreement, and synchronization.\n    *   `A implies B` in a correspondence query means: if event A happens in a run (possibly an interleaved run with an attacker), has event B happened in a corresponding run?\n    *   The queries for `auth_Sat_on_GS => auth_GS_on_Sat` and vice-versa check if one party's authentication belief is tied to the other party's recent participation.\n    *   The `key_*` queries check if both parties derive the same session key using the same nonces.\n    *   The `sync_*` queries check if both parties reach the \"ready for commands\" state having agreed on the same key and nonces. Non-injective queries (`query var:type corresponds EventA(var) => EventB(var)`) are crucial for verifying protocols under potential concurrent or replayed sessions.\n8.  **Main Process:** `process !((let k_GS_Sat = k_GS_Sat in (!processGS(...) | !processSat(...))))` sets up the environment. The `!` operators simulate an infinite number of parallel sessions, allowing ProVerif to explore complex attack scenarios.\n\n**Running this code in ProVerif:**\n\nProVerif will automatically explore possible message flows, including interference by a Dolev-Yao adversary (who controls the network, can intercept, inject, and replay messages, but cannot break cryptographic primitives like MACs or the KDF).\n\nIt will check:\n*   If the `secret` queries hold (is `Ks` secret?).\n*   If the `corresponds` queries hold (do the authentication, key agreement, and synchronization claims hold?).\n\nBased on the structure, this model should verify the claims:\n*   **Secrecy of Ks:** Should be verified.\n*   **Authentication:** Non-injective authentication should be verified, as the MACs with the shared key bind identities to the nonces.\n*   **Agreement/Synchronization:** Should be verified, as both parties derive Ks from the same pair of nonces and confirm SA using the shared key.\n*   **Replay Prevention:** Within a session, the sequential nature of the process prevents simple command replay. Replay attacks *across* sessions would require the attacker to somehow reproduce the *exact* `Ra` and `Rb` pair from a previous session to get the same `Ks`, and then replay the entire sequence. If only a single command+MAC is replayed from an old session, the MAC will fail because the session key `Ks` will almost certainly be different due to fresh nonces in the current run. If an attacker replays CMD1 in the place of CMD2 *within the same session*, the sequential `in` calls in the process models will handle this by not accepting the repeated CMD1 at the point where CMD2 is expected. The two command steps specifically defend against an attacker who might try to trick the Sat into believing a single replayed command is a fresh start of the command phase \u2013 the Sat expects CMD1 *then* CMD2."]], "SPDL-1/oakley-a.spdl": [[true, "// This SPDL code describes the oakley-a protocol based on the provided\n// overview, roles, variables, message flow, and claims.\n\nprotocol oakley-a(I, R)\n{\n    // Constants representing functions used in the protocol\n    const hash: function; // Used for hashing ticket values for KDF\n    const g: function;    // A generic function of a nonce\n    const kdf: function;  // Key Derivation Function\n\n    // Roles define the participants in the protocol\n    role initiator(I, R)\n    {\n        // Variables used by the Initiator role\n        var Ni, Ci, G: nonce;   // Initiator's nonces and the ticket\n        var alg_list: data;     // List of algorithms\n        var Nr, Cr: nonce;      // Responder's nonces (received)\n        var g_i, g_r: data;     // Results of function g on nonces (i: generated, r: received)\n        var SK: key;            // Derived shared session key\n\n        // Message 1: Initiator to Responder\n        // The initiator sends its nonces (Ci, Ni), g(Ni), alg_list, identities, and G,\n        // signed with its private key.

This is the formalization of the security claim.\n        *   Encrypts `pair(I, ni)` using `pkR` and sends it on channel `c`.\n        *   Receives a message from `c` (expected to be the ticket).\n        *   Includes a pattern match `let (=I, =ni) = ticket_T in` to represent the Initiator verifying that the received ticket contains its own identity `I` and the nonce `ni` it sent.\n    *   `Responder(R, skR)`:\n        *   Receives a message from `c`.\n        *   Attempts to `decrypt` the message using its secret key `skR`.\n        *   If decryption is successful and results in a pair `(rec_I, rec_ni)`, it sends this pair (`decrypted_msg` which is the ticket `T`) back on channel `c`.\n5.  **Main Process (`process`):**\n    *   Generates fresh secret/public key pairs for I and R.\n    *   Generates fresh agent identities `I_id` and `R_id`.\n    *   Starts multiple concurrent sessions of the `Initiator` and `Responder` roles using the `!` prefix. The Initiator is given its identity `I_id` and the Responder's public key `pkR`. The Responder is given its identity `R_id` and its secret key `skR`.\n6.  **Security Query (`query secret ni;`):** This tells ProVerif to check if the intruder can deduce the value of `ni` from observing traffic on `c` and using the public information available (like public keys).\n\n**Expected Outcome of the Query:**\n\nThe query `query secret ni;` is expected to fail.\n\n**Reasoning for Expected Failure:**\n\n1.  The Initiator generates a fresh nonce `ni` and sends `crypt(pair(I, ni), pkR)`. The intruder observes this encrypted message.\n2.  The Responder receives the message, decrypts it using `skR` to get `pair(I, ni)`.\n3.  The Responder *sends* `pair(I, ni)` back to the Initiator on channel `c`.\n4.  The intruder is also observing channel `c` for the Responder's response. The intruder will intercept or observe `pair(I, ni)`.\n5.  Since the intruder observes the cleartext value `pair(I, ni)`, they directly learn the value of `ni` (by taking the second element of the pair).\n\nTherefore, the claim that `ni` is secret to the Initiator is violated by the Responder's action of sending the decrypted nonce back unencrypted. The \"untrusted agent\" mentioned in the description corresponds to ProVerif's intruder model, which has access to the communication channel `c`."]], "SPDL-1/pqr.spdl": [[true, "// SPDL description for PKMv2-RSA Protocol based on the provided text description\n\n// Protocol Name\nprotocol PKMv2_RSA\n\n// Roles\n// Mobile Station (MS)\nrole ms {\n    // Variables\n    var msrand: Nonce          // Nonce generated by MS\n    var said: Identifier       // Identifier for MS\n    var ms_prk: PrivateKey     // MS's private RSA key for signing\n    var bs_pubk: PublicKey     // BS's public RSA key for decryption/verification\n    var bsid: Identifier       // Identifier for BS (learned during protocol)\n    var prepak: SymmetricKey   // Pre-shared key established during protocol\n    var tek0, tek1, tek2, tek3: SymmetricKey // Temporary encryption keys (initial)\n    var new_tek0, new_tek1, new_tek2, new_tek3: SymmetricKey // Temporary encryption keys (updated)\n    var akid: Identifier       // Identifier for the key (assuming known beforehand)\n    var c: Data                // Constant or message for key update (assuming known beforehand)\n\n    // Initial Knowledge: What MS knows at the start\n    know msrand              // MS generates its own nonce\n    know said                 // MS knows its own identifier\n    know ms_prk              // MS knows its own private key\n    know bs_pubk             // MS knows BS's public key (e.g., from certificate)\n    know akid                // MS knows the key identifier\n    know c                   // MS knows the constant 'c'\n\n    // Actions: Sequence of messages sent and received by MS\n    actions {\n        // Step 1: MS -> BS (msrand, said, signed with ms_prk)\n        // Description: MS sends msrand, said, and its signature for authenticity.\n        // Assumption: Signature is over {msrand, said} using MS's private key.\n        send 1(msrand, said, sign(ms_prk, {msrand, said}))\n\n        // Step 2: BS -> MS (bsrand, prepak, bsid, encrypted with bs_prk)\n        // Description: BS sends bsrand, prepak, bsid, encrypted with BS's private key.\n        // Interpretation: Encrypting with a private key is typically signing.\n        // SPDL modeling convention for RSA decryption/verification using public key after private key operation:\n        // Assume BS 'encrypts' with bs_prk (effectively signing), MS 'decrypts' with bs_pubk to recover data.\n        recv 2(encrypted_data_bs: Data)\n        let (bsrand_prime: Nonce, prepak_prime: SymmetricKey, bsid_prime: Identifier) = decrypt(bs_pubk, encrypted_data_bs)\n        // MS learns bsrand, prepak, bsid\n        set bsrand = bsrand_prime\n        set prepak = prepak_prime\n        set bsid = bsid_prime\n\n        // Step 3: MS -> BS (Acknowledgement of bsrand, bsid)\n        // Description: MS acknowledges receipt of bsrand and BS's identifier.\n        // Assumption: Acknowledgment involves sending the received values back.\n        send 3(msrand, bsrand, bsid) // Include msrand for context/freshness\n\n        // Step 4: BS -> MS (Hashed value of bsrand, prepak, said, bsid)\n        // Description: BS sends a hashed value based on its nonce, prepak, and identifiers.\n        // Interpretation: Provides integrity check.\n        recv 4(hash_val_bs: Hash)\n        // MS verifies the hash using values received in previous steps\n        assert hash_val_bs == H(bsrand, prepak, said, bsid)\n\n        // Step 5: MS -> BS (Hashed value of msrand, bsrand, akid)\n        // Description: MS responds with a hashed message including msrand, bsrand, and akid.\n        send 5(H(msrand, bsrand, akid))\n\n        // Step 6: BS -> MS (tek0-3, hashed with prepak)\n        // Description: BS sends temporary encryption keys, hashed with prepak.\n        // Interpretation: Keys are sent, hash provides integrity.

The `prf` values serve as mutual authentication checks on the shared secrets (`Gi`, `Gr`) and nonces.\n\n```hlpsl\n% SKEME Basic Protocol Specification in HLPSL\n\n%

A close examination reveals significant commonalities and a single, critical difference.\n\n### Commonalities Between `nsl3th1` and `nsl3th2`\n\nBoth protocols share the exact same structural flow, roles, and cryptographic mechanisms:\n\n1.  **Public Key Cryptography:** Both rely on public key encryption (`E_K(message)` denotes encryption with the public key `K`, implying that only the holder of the corresponding private key can decrypt). This ensures confidentiality and integrity from the perspective of the intended recipient.\n2.  **Nonce-Based Freshness:**\n    *   The Initiator (`I`) generates `ni` (nonce initiator).\n    *   The Responder (`R`) generates `nr` (nonce responder).\n    *   These nonces are exchanged and reflected back, serving to prevent replay attacks and assure each party that the communication is fresh and not an old, replayed session.\n3.  **Three-Message Exchange Pattern:**\n    *   **Message 1 (I -> R):** `I` sends its identity and `ni`, encrypted with `R`'s public key. (e.g., `E_R(P, I, ni)`)\n    *   **Message 2 (R -> I):** `R` sends its `nr` back to `I`, encrypted with `I`'s public key. (e.g., `E_I(nr)`)\n    *   **Message 3 (R -> I):** `R` sends its identity, `ni`, and `nr` back to `I`, also encrypted with `I`'s public key. This serves as a confirmation to `I` that `R` received `ni` and is responding with `nr`. (e.g., `E_I(P, ni, nr, R)`)\n    *   **Message 4 (I -> R):** `I` sends `nr` back to `R`, encrypted with `R`'s public key. This confirms to `R` that `I` received `nr`. (e.g., `E_R(P, nr)`)\n    *   *Self-correction*: The description simplifies the second and third messages from R to I. It says \"Receives a nonce `nr` from `R`, encrypted with `I`'s public key\" and then \"Receives a message containing `P1`, `ni`, `nr`, and the identity of `R`, which is encrypted with `I`'s public key.\" This suggests two separate messages from R to I, which is unusual. A more typical pattern would combine these. However, adhering to the text:\n        *   **Revised Message Flow (as per description):**\n            *   **I -> R:** `E_R(P, I, ni)`\n            *   **R -> I (Msg 2):** `E_I(nr)`\n            *   **R -> I (Msg 3):** `E_I(P, ni, nr, R)`\n            *   **I -> R (Msg 4):** `E_R(P, nr)`\n4.  **Mutual Authentication:** By successfully exchanging and reflecting each other's nonces, both `I` and `R` implicitly authenticate the other party.\n    *   `R` authenticates `I` by seeing `ni` in the first message and reflecting it back. `I` then confirms `R`'s knowledge of `ni` by accepting it in the third message from `R`.\n    *   `I` authenticates `R` by receiving `nr` (in messages 2 and 3) and sending it back in the final message. `R` then confirms `I`'s knowledge of `nr` by accepting it in the final message from `I`.\n5.  **Claim of `Nisynch`:** Both protocols explicitly claim to mitigate \"non-synchronization attacks.\" This is directly supported by the use of nonces and their successful exchange and reflection, ensuring that both parties are \"in sync\" regarding the current session's unique identifiers.\n\n### Key Difference Between `nsl3th1` and `nsl3th2`\n\nThe *only* discernible difference between `nsl3th1` and `nsl3th2` lies in a single parameter included in the encrypted messages:\n\n*   **`nsl3th1` uses `P1`** in its messages.\n*   **`nsl3th2` uses `P2`** in its messages.\n\nWithout further context, `P1` and `P2` appear to be **protocol identifiers** or **contextual parameters**. They are constants embedded in the messages, rather than dynamic data.\n\n**Implications of `P1`/`P2`:**\n*   **Protocol Versioning/Identification:** `P1` and `P2` could serve to distinguish between two distinct \"versions\" or \"purposes\" of an otherwise identical protocol. For example, `P1` might denote a general secure session setup, while `P2` might denote a session setup for a specific application or service.\n*   **Policy/Profile Indicators:** They could represent different security policies, key usage intentions, or service profiles associated with the communication.\n*   **Lack of Functional Difference:** From the provided description, the presence of `P1` versus `P2` *does not* alter the cryptographic operations, message flow, or security properties (like nonce freshness or authentication). The underlying logic for establishing a secure, mutually authenticated session remains the same.\n\n### Summary of Security Features (Applicable to Both)\n\n*   **Confidentiality:** Achieved through public key encryption, ensuring only the intended recipient can decrypt and read the message content.\n*   **Integrity:** While not explicitly using digital signatures, the encryption with the recipient's public key (and the structured inclusion of nonces and identities) helps detect tampering to some extent. If a message is tampered with, decryption will likely fail or yield nonsensical data, leading to protocol termination.\n*   **Authentication:** Mutual authentication of `I` and `R` is achieved through the successful exchange and reflection of nonces.\n*   **Freshness:** Nonces (`ni` and `nr`) ensure that each session is unique and prevent replay attacks.\n\nIn conclusion, `nsl3th1` and `nsl3th2` are structurally identical secure communication protocols. Their sole difference is the presence of a distinct static identifier (`P1` vs. `P2`) within their messages, likely indicating a different protocol version, context, or policy, without altering their core cryptographic functionality or security properties as described."]], "SPDL-1/tls-BM-1.spdl": [[false, "Here's the Scyther model for the simplified TLS protocol described, following the structure and features of the tool.\n\n```\n// Scyther model for a simplified TLS protocol\n// Inspired by Boyd and Mathuria's \"Protocols for Authentication and Key Establishment\"\n\n// --- Types ---\n// nonce: For fresh, unpredictable values (e.g., nonces)\ntype nonce.\n// key: For cryptographic keys (e.g., pre-master key)\ntype key.\n// data: For general data elements, e.g., hashed values, encrypted blocks\ntype data.\n\n// --- Functions and Operators ---\n// Public key (pk) and secret key (sk) functions for public-key cryptography\n// In Scyther, pk(A) implicitly means the public key of agent A, and sk(A) is A's secret key.\n// encrypt(M, K): encrypts message M with key K (public key encryption)\n// decrypt(C, K): decrypts ciphertext C with key K (private key decryption)\n// sign(M, K): signs message M with key K (secret key signature)\n// verify(S, K): verifies signature S with key K (public key verification) - handled implicitly by recv\n// hash(X, Y, Z, ...): a one-way hash function\n// symenc(M, K): symmetric encryption of M with symmetric key K\n// symdec(C, K): symmetric decryption of C with symmetric key K - handled implicitly by recv\n\n// --- Roles ---\n\n// Role: Alice (Initiator)\n// A: Represents Alice (the current agent)\n// B: Represents Bob (the intended recipient/responder)\n// S: Represents a trusted third party (e.g., for PKI services, though not explicitly used in this simplified model)\nrole Alice(A, B: agent, S: agent)\n{\n    // Internal variables for Alice\n    var na: nonce.       // Alice's nonce\n    var pmk: key.        // Pre-master key generated by Alice\n    var nb: nonce.       // Bob's nonce (received)\n    var K_session: data. // The derived session key (shared secret)\n\n    // --- Protocol Steps for Alice ---\n\n    // 1.

Only A (or someone with `k(A,S)`) could create a valid `{ B,kab }k(A,S)` message that S can decrypt successfully.\n    *   **S to B:** S's message is authenticated to B by the use of `k(B,S)`. Only S (or someone with `k(B,S)`) could create a valid `{ A,kab }k(B,S)` message that B can decrypt successfully.\n    *   **A to B (via S):** A does not directly authenticate to B, nor does B directly authenticate to A. The protocol relies on S as a trusted third party (TTP). A trusts S to deliver `kab` only to the legitimate B, and B trusts S that the `kab` received originates from a legitimate A (specifically the A mentioned in the message).\n    *   **Server's Role:** S implicitly authenticates A in step 1 via `k(A,S)` decryption. S implicitly selects B as the recipient based on A's request and encrypts the key for B using `k(B,S)`. S does *not* authenticate B to A within this protocol run.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Provides strong authentication between the participants and the server. Provides *identity* authentication between A and B *via the trusted server*.\n\n3.  **Freshness:**\n    *   `kab` is generated fresh by A for each run.\n    *   However, the protocol lacks explicit mechanisms (like nonces or timestamps) to ensure the messages are fresh.\n    *   **Vulnerability:** A replay of the A->S message by an attacker or A itself could cause S to resend an old `kab` to B. Similarly, a replay of the S->B message could cause B to accept an old `kab`. While this doesn't compromise `kab`'s confidentiality to the attacker, it could lead A and B to use an outdated session key, potentially undermining security if an older key has been compromised or if key freshness is critical for sequential session integrity.\n\n4.  **Forward Secrecy:**\n    *   The session key `kab` is encrypted directly using the long-term keys `k(A,S)` and `k(B,S)`.\n    *   If an attacker compromises the long-term keys `k(A,S)` or `k(B,S)` *after* a session has completed, they could decrypt recorded past messages and recover the `kab` used in that session.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The protocol does not provide forward secrecy.\n\n### SpoT/ProVerif Specification\n\nLet's model this protocol using SpoT/ProVerif syntax to verify the confidentiality claim (`claim_3(B, Secret, kab)`).\n\n```proverif\n/* Protocol: wmfbrutus */\n\n/* Types */\ntype agent.       /* Represents users A, B, and the server S */\ntype key.         /* Represents long-term symmetric keys k(A,S), k(B,S) */\ntype seskey.      /* Represents the session key kab */\ntype message.     /* Generic type for messages on the channel */\n\n/* Channel */\nfree c: channel.  /* Represents the public, insecure network channel */\n\n/* Symmetric Encryption Functions */\nfun senc(bitstring, key): bitstring. /* Encrypts a bitstring with a key */\nfun sdec(bitstring, key): bitstring. /* Decrypts a bitstring with a key */\n\n/* Equality test for patterns */\nequation sdec(senc(m, k), k) = m.\n\n/* Secret Predicate - Used for claims */\n/* pred secret(agent, bitstring).

The equation `sdec(senc(m, k), k) = m` states that decrypting with the correct key recovers the original message.\n4.  **Private Keys:** `private free kAS, kBS: key` declares the long-term keys shared between A and S, and B and S, respectively. `private free` means these keys are *not* known to the intruder initially.\n5.  **Agents:** `const A, B, S: agent` declares A, B, and S as specific constant agents.\n6.  **Shared Keys Predicate:** `pred keyshared(agent, agent, key)` is used to represent which agents share which long-term keys. The `insert` statements put these facts into the knowledge base at the start. `!` makes these facts persistently available (as if the key setup happened multiple times).\n7.  **Processes:**\n    *   `processA`, `processS`, `processB` define the actions of each role.\n    *   `!` before the process calls (`!processA(...)`, etc.) indicates that these roles can be executed multiple times concurrently, simulating multiple sessions.\n    *   `new kab: seskey;` in `processA` ensures that `kab` is a fresh value unique to each run initiated by A.\n    *   `get keyshared(...)` retrieves the necessary long-term key from the knowledge base.\n    *   `in(c, ...)` and `out(c, ...)` model receiving and sending messages on the public channel.\n    *   `senc/sdec` are used for encryption and decryption.\n    *   The `if decryption_res <> (0,0)` check models that decryption only proceeds if the ciphertext corresponds to a valid encrypted structure (basic check provided by ProVerif's `sdec`).\n8.  **Query:** `query x: seskey; inj-secret B x.` is the core security claim being checked.\n    *   `x: seskey` specifies that we are querying about values of type `seskey`.\n    *   `inj-secret B x` checks *injective secrecy* for agent B concerning the value `x`. This means that for any session key `x` that B receives and claims as secret (in this process model, receiving and successfully decrypting the message implies B will claim it), the intruder should not be able to learn `x`. \"Injective\" means that if B receives `x` in a specific session *instance*, the intruder shouldn't know *that specific instance's* `x`.\n\n### Expected ProVerif Output & Summary\n\nWhen run through ProVerif, this specification should indicate that the `inj-secret B x` query holds. This means that the intruder cannot learn the session key `kab` that B receives, provided the long-term keys `kAS` and `kBS` remain secret.\n\n**Summary of Findings (based on analysis and expected ProVerif result):**\n\nThe `wmfbrutus` protocol successfully establishes a confidential session key `kab` between A and B with the help of a trusted server S. The confidentiality relies on the security of the long-term symmetric keys shared between each user and the server. The protocol provides authentication between users and the server, and identity binding between A and B via the server.\n\nHowever, the protocol is susceptible to replay attacks, which could lead to the use of outdated session keys, although it doesn't compromise the confidentiality of the key to the intruder itself. It also lacks forward secrecy. For many applications, adding nonces or timestamps to ensure message freshness would be necessary to mitigate replay risks."]], "SPDL-1/yahalom-ban-paulson.spdl": [[true, "# Scyther script for Yahalom Protocol (BAN Modified per description)\n# Based on the provided description of the protocol's steps and roles.\n# This model aims to be faithful to the description, including the specific\n# encryption in Message 2, and the message contents in other steps.\n# The ticket flow is interpreted as S sending it to A, and A forwarding it to B\n# in Message 4, which is the standard Yahalom flow implied by A's actions.\n\nagent A, B, S;\nkey Kas, Kbs: symkey; # Long-term shared keys: A-S, B-S\nkey kab: symkey;     # Session key between A and B\nnonce na, nb;        # Nonces\n\nprotocol yahalom_ban_modified_desc(A, B, S)\n\n# Role A (Initiator)\nrole A(A, B, S, Kas)\n   t\u01b0\u01a1i na;             # 1.

The attacker can intercept messages sent by the Client (D) or can trick D into sending its initial message to the attacker's address instead of the legitimate GW's address (e.g., via DNS poisoning or network manipulation).\n2.  The attacker knows the format of D's initial message and potentially the client's `AID` (which might be inferable or known).\n\n**Attack Mechanism:**\n\n1.  The Client (D) initiates the authentication process by generating `T1`, `Tr`, computing `Vpr`, `e`, and sending the message `{e, AID, Tr, T1}` towards the expected address of the legitimate Gateway (GW).\n2.  The Attacker (A) intercepts this message or receives it directly.\n3.  **Crucially, the Attacker does *not* need to be able to decrypt or validate D's message.** The attacker does not possess the secrets (`Krs`, `z`, `Ts`) required to verify `e` or derive `N`.\n4.  The Attacker (A) simply needs to send a response message that appears to be from the Gateway and conforms to the expected format `{Npr, T2}`.\n5.  The Attacker (A) generates a fresh nonce `T2_fake`.\n6.  The Attacker (A) generates a random value (let's call it `N_fake`) and computes `Npr_fake = H(N_fake)`. *The attacker does not need to know the original `N` used by D.*\n7.  The Attacker (A) sends the forged message `{Npr_fake, T2_fake}` to the Client (D), pretending to be the legitimate GW.\n\n**Why it Works (Vulnerability):**\n\nThe description of the Client's actions (D) *does not include any step for D to verify the response received from the gateway*. The protocol description states D \"Claims various properties...\" after sending the first message, but provides no subsequent steps for processing or validating the GW's response `{Npr, T2}` using shared secrets or values derived from the initial message.\n\nSince D does not perform any verification on `{Npr, T2}` using its secrets (`Krs`, `z`, `Ts`) or the values it sent (`e`, `N`), it has no way to confirm that the message actually came from the legitimate Gateway. D will simply accept the message `{Npr_fake, T2_fake}` as a valid response from the GW.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n*   The Client (D) is fooled into believing it has successfully completed the initial phase of authentication or received a legitimate challenge/response component (`Npr`, `T2`) from the Gateway.\n*   The Client might proceed to subsequent steps (if any exist, though not described) or make decisions based on the false assumption that it is communicating with the real Gateway.\n*   This breaks the fundamental security goal of mutual authentication (or even just server authentication), as an unauthorized party can successfully impersonate the server from the client's perspective at this stage.\n\n**Countermeasure:**\n\nTo prevent this spoofing attack, the protocol requires a step where the Client (D) verifies the Gateway's response. This typically involves the GW sending a value derived from the original message's secret components (`N`, `e`, `Krs`, etc.) that only the legitimate GW (possessing `Krs`, `z`, `Ts`) could have computed correctly, and which D can verify using its own knowledge of these secrets. For instance, GW could include a hash computed over `Npr`, `T2`, and a secret derived from the first step, which D can check."]], "SPDL-1/andrew-ban-concrete.spdl": [[false, "```prolog\n(*\n    ProVerif Model: BAN Concrete Andrew Secure RPC Protocol\n\n    Based on the description provided, adapting for ProVerif's trace-based model.\n    This model focuses on the message flow and standard security properties\n    like secrecy and authentication (agreement), interpreting the keys as\n    symmetric shared keys kIR between I and R for the main encrypted messages.\n    The \"dummy role X\" and the specific \"Nisynch\" claims from the description\n    are not directly modeled as they represent a specific logical or\n    implementation layer not easily translated into a standard trace model\n    without further clarification of their purpose in the message exchange.\n\n    The protocol steps are:\n    1.

The Server, being trusted, *does* learn `K`.\n\n    *   **`claim(A, Weakagree)`:** Alice claims weak agreement on K. \"Weak agreement\" typically means \"If I (Alice) successfully complete my run of the protocol, then Bob has also completed his run (or a specific part of it) using the same secret K.\"\n        *   Alice completes her run when she receives Msg 4, decrypts it, and presumably verifies `h(K)`.\n        *   Msg 4 `{B, h(K)}_kas` comes from the Server, who got `h(K)` in Msg 3 `{A, h(K)}_kbs` from Bob. Bob sends Msg 3 only *after* receiving `K` in Msg 2 `{A, K}_kbs` from the Server.\n        *   Thus, if Alice receives a valid Msg 4 containing `h(K)` that matches her `K`, it strongly implies that Bob received `K` (Msg 2), computed `h(K)`, and sent it to the Server (Msg 3).\n        *   **Evaluation:** This interpretation of weak agreement (Alice confirming Bob received K and processed it) seems to hold based on the message flow.\n\n    *   **`claim(B, Weakagree)`:** Bob claims weak agreement on K. If Bob completes his run, Alice has also completed her run using the same K. Bob completes his run after receiving Msg 2 and sending Msg 3.\n        *   Bob sends Msg 3 `(B, S, {A, h(K)}_kbs)` to the Server.\n        *   The protocol description *does not include* a message from the Server back to Bob confirming Alice received `h(K)` or otherwise indicating Alice's state.\n        *   Bob *only* knows that the Server received his `h(K)`. He has no direct confirmation from Alice, or even indirect confirmation from the Server that Alice received the final message (Msg 4).\n        *   **Evaluation:** Under a standard interpretation of weak agreement (where one party confirms the other reached a state related to the secret), Bob's claim does *not* appear to be supported by the protocol flow. If \"completes his run\" simply means \"sends Msg 3\", then Bob has no guarantee about Alice's state afterward.\n\n5.  **Potential Weaknesses / Considerations:**\n\n    *   **No Freshness:** The protocol lacks nonces or timestamps. An attacker could potentially replay old messages.\n        *   *Replaying Msg 1:* An attacker could replay an old `(A, S, {B, K}_kas)`. The Server might process this, sending the old `K` to Bob (Msg 2). If Bob accepts this old key, security is broken. Server needs to track active sessions or use nonces/timestamps.\n        *   *Replaying Msg 3:* An attacker could replay an old `(B, S, {A, h(K)}_kbs)`. The Server might forward this old `h(K)` to Alice (Msg 4). If Alice accepts this old hash, it could disrupt a new session or cause her to incorrectly believe Bob is using an old key.\n    *   **Server is a Single Point of Failure/Trust:** As a trusted mediator, the Server knows `K`. If the Server is compromised, the secrecy of `K` is lost. This is inherent in this type of server-mediated protocol.\n    *   **Hashing for Confirmation:** Using `h(K)` provides confirmation that the other party *knew* `K` and could compute its hash. However, `h(K)` does not provide key *confirmation* in the sense that neither Alice nor Bob explicitly verifies that the other *possesses* the correct `K` after the exchange is complete (though Alice verifies Bob received K by checking h(K)). Bob has no confirmation mechanism that Alice received the final message or verified `h(K)`.\n\n**Summary Evaluation:**\n\nBakatar-0 is a simple server-mediated key exchange protocol using pre-shared symmetric keys for protection.\n\n*   **Confidentiality of K:** Achieved against external attackers due to encryption. The Server, by design, knows K.\n*   **Authentication:** Parties authenticate implicitly by successfully decrypting messages using their shared secrets with the Server. The identities within the messages are bound to the encrypted content.\n*   **Agreement:** Alice achieves weak agreement, confirming Bob received and processed the key. Bob does *not* achieve a similar level of agreement from the defined flow; he gets no confirmation that Alice completed her part.\n*   **Freshness:** Lacks protection against replay attacks. This is a significant vulnerability.\n\nOverall, the protocol provides basic key secrecy and Alice-side weak agreement against passive attackers, relying heavily on the trusted Server and pre-shared keys. However, the lack of freshness protection makes it vulnerable to active replay attacks, and Bob's agreement claim is not fully supported by the message flow."]], "SPDL-1/bke-broken.spdl": [[false, "Okay, let's analyze the Bilateral Key Exchange with Public Key (BKEPK) protocol using ProVerif.\n\nProVerif is a symbolic verification tool for security protocols.

ProVerif uses these equations for simplification and inference.\n4.  **Keys and Identities:**\n    *   `free skA, skB`: Declares Alice's and Bob's secret keys as `free` names, meaning they are initially unknown to the intruder.\n    *   `let pkA = pk(skA). let pkB = pk(skB).`: Defines the public keys associated with the secret keys. ProVerif can derive `pkA` from `skA` using the `pk` function.\n    *   `constants IDA, IDB`: Declares Alice's and Bob's identities as public, fixed values.\n5.  **Events:** These are used to mark specific points in the protocol execution.\n    *   `responder_generates_kab(key)`: Fired by Bob when he generates the shared secret `kab`. This is crucial for the secrecy query.\n    *   `initiator_learns_kab(key)`: Fired by Alice when she successfully decrypts Bob's message and extracts `kab`.\n    *   `endA(key)`, `endB(key)`: Fired when Alice and Bob successfully complete their part of the protocol, knowing the shared key. Useful for tracking session completion.\n6.  **Processes:**\n    *   `initiator(skA, pkB, IDA, IDB)`: Models Alice's actions. It takes her secret key and Bob's public information as parameters. It generates a nonce (`new NI`), sends the first message, receives Bob's message, decrypts it, performs checks (identity and hash), sends the final confirmation, and fires events.\n    *   `responder(skB, pkA, IDA, IDB)`: Models Bob's actions. It takes his secret key and Alice's public information. It receives Alice's message, decrypts it, checks her identity, generates its own nonce (`new NR`) and the shared key (`new kab`), sends the response message, receives Alice's confirmation, decrypts it, performs a check (hash of NR), and fires events. Note that `new kab` ensures the generated key is fresh for each session instance.\n    *   `main`: Sets up the environment. It makes Alice's and Bob's public keys available on the public channel (`out(c, pkA); out(c, pkB);`). Then, it starts one instance of the initiator and one instance of the responder running concurrently (`|`).\n7.  **Security Queries:**\n    *   `query attacker(k) where responder_generates_kab(k).`: This is the core secrecy query. It asks ProVerif whether the intruder (`attacker`) can learn any key `k` for which the event `responder_generates_kab(k)` occurred. In other words, can the intruder learn the specific `kab` generated by Bob for this session?\n\n**Analysis with ProVerif:**\n\nWhen you run this code in ProVerif, the tool will explore all possible execution paths, including those involving the intruder intercepting, modifying, and injecting messages.\n\nThe crucial part is the secrecy query: `query attacker(k) where responder_generates_kab(k).`.\n\nBased on the protocol structure and the use of public key encryption and fresh secrets:\n\n*   Step 1 (`{NI, IDA}_pkB`): Only Bob (with `skB`) can decrypt this.\n*   Step 2 (`{hash(NI), NR, IDB, kab}_pkA`): Only Alice (with `skA`) can decrypt this. This is where `kab` is transmitted. The intruder cannot decrypt this message because they don't have `skA`.\n*   Step 3 (`{hash(NR)}_kab`): Only someone with `kab` can decrypt/verify this.\n\nSince `kab` is generated as a `new` value by Bob in Step 2 and is only transmitted encrypted under Alice's public key (`pkA`) in Step 2 and then used for symmetric encryption in Step 3, and Alice's private key `skA` is kept secret (`free skA`), the intruder should not be able to learn `kab`.\n\n**Expected ProVerif Output:**\n\n```\n...\nQuery attacker(k) where responder_generates_kab(k). is false.\n```\n\nThis output confirms that, under the symbolic Dolev-Yao model assumptions and with correctly implemented cryptography, the shared secret key `kab` generated by the responder remains secret from the attacker.\n\n**Security Considerations Modeled:**\n\n*   **Secrecy of `kab`:** Directly queried and expected to hold.\n*   **Use of Nonces:** `NI` and `NR` ensure freshness. The hash checks (`hash(NI)` and `hash(NR)`) coupled with encryption bind these nonces to the session participants and message flow, preventing simple replay or mixing attacks where an old `kab` might be accepted.\n*   **Integrity:** The hash checks (`hash(NI)`, `hash(NR)`) provide a form of integrity check for the messages. The public key encryption also provides integrity against tampering *by someone without the decryption key*, but the hash confirms specific content was received and accepted.\n*   **Authenticity:** While not explicitly queried with correspondence properties in this basic model, the checks within the processes (`if IDA_recv = IDA`, `if IDB_recv = IDB`, `if h_ni_recv = hash(NI)`, `if h_nr_recv = hash(NR)`) provide mutual authentication *to some degree*. Alice authenticates Bob by checking the hash of her nonce encrypted with *her* public key in step 2. Bob authenticates Alice by checking the hash of *his* nonce encrypted with the shared `kab` in step 3 (implying Alice knows `kab`, which she only should if she got it from Bob in step 2).\n\n**Limitations of the Model / Protocol (as is common for simple examples):**\n\n*   **Identity Binding:** The model assumes public keys `pkA`, `pkB` are correctly bound to identities `IDA`, `IDB`. In a real system, this requires a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) or similar mechanism. ProVerif's `out(c, pkA); out(c, pkB);` and using `pkA`/`pkB` directly models this implicitly by assuming the `pk` provided is genuinely Alice's or Bob's.\n*   **Parallel Sessions:** The basic model runs only one instance of each role. ProVerif can analyze multiple sessions, but this setup is sufficient for checking the core secrecy property against a standard intruder.\n*   **Forward Secrecy:** If `skA` or `skB` are compromised *after* a session completes, the recorded messages could potentially be decrypted to reveal `kab`. The protocol as described does not offer forward secrecy.\n*   **Denial of Service:** The protocol doesn't include explicit mechanisms against DoS attacks (e.g., sending many Step 1 messages to Bob).\n\nIn conclusion, the ProVerif analysis based on this model is expected to confirm the secrecy of the generated key `kab` against a passive or active intruder in the Dolev-Yao model, given the ideal properties of the cryptographic primitives."]], "SPDL-1/boyd-1.spdl": [[false, "```proverif\n(* ProVerif model for a variant of the Boyd Key Agreement Protocol *)\n\n(* Based on the description, modeling a server-assisted key exchange\n   with symmetric encryption for key distribution and MACs for authentication.\n   The 'm' and 'unm' functions are modeled as encryption and decryption\n   using long-term shared keys between users and the server.\n   'Macseed' is the key for the MAC function.\n   'Sessionkey' is the established shared secret.\n   The description of message contents is high-level, so this model\n   implements a plausible flow consistent with the described elements\n   (nonces, server, MACs, key types, m/unm as inverse operations).\n*)\n\n(* --- Types --- *)\ntype nonce.

Let's break down its design, claims, and identified vulnerabilities in detail.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of the Buttyan Nagy Vajda Protocol\n\n#### 1. Protocol Goal and Participants\nThe primary goal is secure entity authentication among three distinct parties: Alice (R0), Bob (R1), and Charlie (R2). It aims for mutual authentication, meaning each party should be assured of the identity and freshness of the other parties involved. Nonces are used to prevent replay attacks and ensure freshness.\n\n#### 2. Detailed Message Flow and Information Exchange\n\nThe protocol proceeds in six steps, building up shared knowledge and verifying participation through the exchange of nonces and encrypted blocks.\n\n*   **Step 1: Alice Initiates with her Nonce**\n    *   `R0 -> R1: n0`\n    *   Alice generates a fresh nonce `n0` and sends it directly to Bob.\n    *   *Purpose:* Establishes freshness from Alice's side and informs Bob of her intention to initiate.\n\n*   **Step 2: Bob Forwards and Adds his Nonce**\n    *   `R1 -> R2: n1, {R1, n0}k(R1, R2)`\n    *   Bob receives `n0`.\n    *   Bob generates his own fresh nonce `n1`.\n    *   Bob encrypts his own ID (`R1`) and Alice's nonce (`n0`) with the shared symmetric key `k(R1, R2)` (shared between Bob and Charlie).\n    *   Bob sends `n1` (in plaintext) and the encrypted block to Charlie.\n    *   *Purpose:* Bob's `n1` provides freshness from his side. The encrypted block proves to Charlie that Bob knows `n0` and that Bob is the sender. Charlie can decrypt this block to verify `R1` and learn `n0`.\n\n*   **Step 3: Charlie Verifies, Adds his Nonce, and Responds to Alice**\n    *   `R2 -> R0: n2, {R2, n1, R1, n0}k(R0, R2)`\n    *   Charlie receives `n1` and `{R1, n0}k(R1, R2)`.\n    *   Charlie decrypts `{R1, n0}k(R1, R2)` using `k(R1, R2)`. This authenticates Bob to Charlie and allows Charlie to extract `R1` and `n0`.\n    *   Charlie generates his own fresh nonce `n2`.\n    *   Charlie encrypts his own ID (`R2`), Bob's nonce (`n1`), Bob's ID (`R1`), and Alice's original nonce (`n0`) with the shared symmetric key `k(R0, R2)` (shared between Alice and Charlie).\n    *   Charlie sends `n2` (in plaintext) and the encrypted block to Alice.\n    *   *Purpose:* Charlie's `n2` provides freshness. The encrypted block `k(R0, R2)` proves to Alice that Charlie is the sender, and that he has received `n1` from Bob and `n0` (originating from Alice) via Bob. Alice will decrypt this to verify Charlie's ID, and crucially, to see her own `n0` and Bob's `n1` returning via Charlie, thereby verifying their participation.\n\n*   **Step 4: Alice Verifies and Responds to Bob**\n    *   `R0 -> R1: {R0, n2, R2, n1}k(R0, R1)`\n    *   Alice receives `n2` and `{R2, n1, R1, n0}k(R0, R2)`.\n    *   Alice decrypts `{R2, n1, R1, n0}k(R0, R2)` using `k(R0, R2)`. This authenticates Charlie to Alice. She extracts `R2`, `n1`, `R1`, and her own `n0`. The presence of `n0` assures her that Charlie received it, and `n1` assures her that Charlie received Bob's nonce.\n    *   Alice encrypts her own ID (`R0`), Charlie's nonce (`n2`), Charlie's ID (`R2`), and Bob's nonce (`n1`) with the shared symmetric key `k(R0, R1)` (shared between Alice and Bob).\n    *   Alice sends this encrypted block to Bob.\n    *   *Purpose:* This is Alice's confirmation to Bob. The encrypted block assures Bob that Alice is the sender and that she has successfully processed Charlie's message, which included Bob's nonce (`n1`) and Charlie's nonce (`n2`). Bob can decrypt this to verify `R0`, `n2`, `R2`, and `n1` (his own nonce).\n\n*   **Step 5: Bob Verifies and Responds to Charlie**\n    *   `R1 -> R2: {R1, R0, n2}k(R1, R2)`\n    *   Bob receives `{R0, n2, R2, n1}k(R0, R1)`.\n    *   Bob decrypts this block using `k(R0, R1)`. This authenticates Alice to Bob. He extracts `R0`, `n2`, `R2`, and his own `n1`. The presence of `n1` assures him that Alice received it.\n    *   Bob encrypts his own ID (`R1`), Alice's ID (`R0`), and Charlie's nonce (`n2`) with the shared symmetric key `k(R1, R2)` (shared between Bob and Charlie).\n    *   Bob sends this encrypted block to Charlie.\n    *   *Purpose:* This is Bob's final confirmation to Charlie. The encrypted block assures Charlie that Bob is the sender and that he has successfully processed Alice's message, which included Charlie's nonce (`n2`) and Alice's ID (`R0`). Charlie can decrypt this to verify `R1`, `R0`, and `n2` (his own nonce).\n\n*   **Step 6: Charlie Receives Final Confirmation**\n    *   `R2 <- R1: {R1, R0, n2}k(R1, R2)`\n    *   Charlie receives the final encrypted block from Bob.\n    *   Charlie decrypts this block using `k(R1, R2)`. This authenticates Bob to Charlie. He extracts `R1`, `R0`, and his own `n2`. The presence of `n2` assures him that Bob received his nonce, implying Alice also received it (via Charlie and Bob).\n    *   *Purpose:* Charlie gets the final confirmation that Bob (and indirectly Alice) have processed the information correctly.\n\n#### 3. Evaluation of Claims (Niagree & Nisynch)\n\nThe claims revolve around non-interactive agreement (Niagree) and synchronization (Nisynch).\n\n*   **Niagree (Non-interactive Agreement):** If party A claims Niagree with party B, it means that when A finishes its part of the protocol, it is assured that B has also successfully finished its part (or at least received all necessary information to do so) and they agree on the session parameters (e.g., nonces, identities). This implies no further message from B is needed for A to be confident.\n*   **Nisynch (Synchronization):** Similar to Niagree, but focuses on the state of the protocol. If A claims Nisynch with B, it means that if A believes it has completed, then B also believes it has completed and they are at the same stage.\n\nLet's examine the specific claims and the identified vulnerabilities:\n\n*   **Claim A1 (R0 - Alice): R0 claims Niagree with R1 (Bob).**\n    *   **Vulnerability Confirmed:** Alice sends her last message (`send_4`) to Bob and then, by definition of non-interactive agreement, she should be able to \"terminate\" or conclude her run with confidence. However, she does *not* receive any acknowledgment from Bob that he *received* and *processed* this message. If `send_4` is lost in transit, Bob will not proceed to `send_5`, and Alice will have an incorrect belief about Bob's state. Therefore, Alice cannot be sure Bob is aware of having completed his part, thus **failing Niagree for Alice with Bob**.\n\n*   **Claim A2 (R0 - Alice): R0 claims Nisynch with R1 (Bob).**\n    *   This claim fails for the same reason as A1. If Alice terminates after `send_4`, and Bob doesn't receive `send_4`, then their states are not synchronized.\n\n*   **Claim B1 (R1 - Bob): R1 claims Niagree with R0 (Alice).**\n    *   Bob *receives* Alice's last message (`recv_4`). He verifies `n1` (his own nonce) and `n2` (Charlie's nonce) and `R0`, `R2`. He then sends `send_5` to Charlie. From Bob's perspective, since he received Alice's final message, he can be reasonably assured that Alice has completed her verification and has obtained the necessary nonces. So, Bob *can* satisfy Niagree with Alice.\n\n*   **Claim B2 (R1 - Bob): R1 claims Nisynch with R0 (Alice).**\n    *   Similar to B1, as Bob receives Alice's last message, he can consider them synchronized.\n\n*   **Claim C1 (R2 - Charlie): R2 claims Niagree with R1 (Bob).**\n    *   Charlie *receives* Bob's last message (`recv_5`). He verifies `n2` (his own nonce), `R1`, and `R0`. Since Charlie receives the final message from Bob containing his own nonce, he can be reasonably assured that Bob has completed his part of the protocol and has the necessary information. So, Charlie *can* satisfy Niagree with Bob.\n\n*   **Claim C2 (R2 - Charlie): R2 claims Nisynch with R1 (Bob).**\n    *   Similar to C1, as Charlie receives Bob's last message, he can consider them synchronized.\n\n#### 4. Type Flaw Attack\n\nThe description mentions a \"type flaw attack concerning role R0, particularly when only two agents are active in the system.\"\nA type flaw attack typically occurs when information of one \"type\" (e.g., a nonce or an identifier for a specific role) can be misinterpreted as another \"type\" of information by a party. This often leads to confusion about who is communicating with whom, or what information is being exchanged.\n\nIn a scenario with only two active agents (e.g., Alice and Bob, with Charlie being an attacker or non-existent), the type flaw might exploit:\n\n*   **Role Confusion:** An attacker (pretending to be Charlie, or manipulating messages as if Charlie were absent) could try to make Alice believe she is performing a two-party protocol directly with Bob, when in reality, the protocol is designed for three parties, and the attacker is interfering with the Charlie role.\n*   **Data Misinterpretation:** If an encrypted block contains `R2` or `n2`, an attacker might try to replace `R2` with `R1` (Bob's ID) or `n2` with `n1` (Bob's nonce) in a way that, if Alice somehow expects a two-party interaction, she might misinterpret who is who. For example, in `send_3`, Charlie sends `{R2, n1, R1, n0}k(R0, R2)`. If an attacker could somehow re-encrypt this with `k(R0,R1)` (e.g., if keys are derived in a weak manner, or `k(R0,R2)` was the same as `k(R0,R1)`), and modify `R2` to `R1`, Alice might believe `n1` came directly from Bob and `n0` was verified, without realizing Charlie's distinct role.\n\nThe protocol *does* include `R0`, `R1`, `R2` as plaintext fields within the encrypted blocks, which helps to mitigate simple role confusion. However, the mention of \"when only two agents are active\" suggests that the *absence* of the third agent or an attacker's impersonation of the third agent in a simplified context could lead to Alice misinterpreting the flow or the roles of the remaining parties, especially if her logic assumes a three-party interaction and she fails to detect the absence of the third party correctly.\n\n#### 5. Conclusion and Potential Improvements\n\nThe Buttyan Nagy Vajda protocol provides a multi-party authentication scheme with chained nonces and encrypted identifiers to establish trust. However, it has clear shortcomings:\n\n*   **Lack of Alice's Niagree:** The primary identified flaw is Alice's inability to confirm that Bob received her final message and completed his part of the protocol. This is a significant weakness for Alice's confidence in the authentication outcome.\n*   **Potential Type Flaw:** While the exact mechanism is not detailed, the risk of role confusion or data misinterpretation, especially in reduced-participant scenarios, highlights a need for more robust message typing or role distinction within the protocol.\n\n**Suggested Improvements:**\n\n1.  **For Alice's Niagree:** Add an additional message from Bob to Alice after `send_5` (or after `recv_4` if the protocol can be shortened).\n    *   `R1 -> R0: {R1, n2, R0}k(R0, R1)` (Bob confirms receipt of Alice's message and his completion using `n2` from Charlie, and Alice's ID).\n    *   This extra step would allow Alice to receive a confirmation, thus satisfying Niagree and Nisynch for her.\n\n2.  **Mitigating Type Flaws:**\n    *   **Explicit Message Typing:** Include a \"message type\" field within encrypted blocks (e.g., `Type.BNV.Step3`, `Type.BNV.Step4`) to explicitly declare the message's purpose and the number of participants it's intended for.\n    *   **Role Identification:** Ensure that all participants' roles (`R0`, `R1`, `R2`) are unambiguously present and checked within encrypted blocks, especially for messages intended for multi-party verification.\n    *   **Contextual Information:** If possible, include an explicit \"number of participants\" field in the initial setup or within messages, which could be validated.\n\nIn summary, while the Buttyan Nagy Vajda protocol sets up a complex multi-party authentication, its reliance on specific message flows without final acknowledgments for all parties and potential ambiguities in role interpretation make it vulnerable in practical scenarios. Addressing these issues would significantly enhance its security and reliability."]], "SPDL-1/carkey-broken-limited.spdl": [[false, "Okay, let's analyze the `carkeybrokenlim` protocol based on the provided description.\n\n**Analysis of `carkeybrokenlim` Protocol**\n\nBased on the description, the protocol is extremely simple:\n\n1.  **Initiator (I) -> Responder (R):** `(I, R, ni)` (where `ni` is a fresh nonce generated by I). The description syntax `send_1(I, R, I, R)` seems like a notational variation indicating sender I, receiver R for step 1, followed by the message content `I, R, ni` as stated in the text, although the example content `I, R, I, R` is confusing. Assuming the text \"includes its identity (I), the responder's identity (R), and the nonce (ni)\" is the definitive list of message contents, the message is `(I, R, ni)`.\n2.  **Responder (R):** Receives `(I', R', ni')`. If `R' == R`, the responder claims `claim_2(R, ni')`.\n\n**Evaluation of Security Properties and Claims:**\n\n1.  **Secure Communication (Claimed):** The description claims the protocol is for \"secure communication\".\n    *   **Evaluation:** This claim is **false** based on the described steps. The message `(I, R, ni)` is sent in plaintext with no cryptographic protection (encryption, signatures, MACs).\n        *   **Confidentiality:** The message content (identities and nonce) is exposed to anyone who can intercept the communication channel.\n        *   **Integrity:** An attacker can modify the message `(I, R, ni)` in transit (e.g., change `I` to `A`, `R` to `R'`, or `ni` to `ni'`) without detection.\n        *   **Authentication:** There is no mechanism for the responder `R` to verify that the message `(I, R, ni)` actually originated from the legitimate initiator `I`. The responder simply trusts the `I` field in the received message.\n\n2.  **Nonces and Replay Attacks (Claimed):** The description states nonces are used \"to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks.\"\n    *   **Evaluation:** While a nonce `ni` *is* included in the message, its usage in the protocol is insufficient to prevent meaningful attacks.\n        *   The nonce `ni` is generated by the initiator `I`.\n        *   The responder `R` receives a message containing `ni` and makes a claim based on it.\n        *   However, since the message is unauthenticated, an attacker `A` can:\n            *   Intercept a legitimate message `(I, R, ni)`.\n            *   **Replay Attack:** Send the *exact same message* `(I, R, ni)` to `R` later. `R` will receive it and make the same claim `claim_2(R, ni)` again. While `R` is claiming synchronization *for that specific nonce*, it can be tricked into repeating the synchronization event. (Stateful responders *might* detect this specific replay if they remember past nonces, but the protocol description doesn't specify this).\n            *   **Impersonation Attack (using a fresh nonce):** Generate a *new* nonce `ni_A`. Send the message `(I, R, ni_A)` pretending to be `I`. `R` will receive this message, see `I` in the message content, see its own identity `R`, and claim `claim_2(R, ni_A)`. `R` is now \"synchronized\" with an attacker impersonating `I`, using a nonce the legitimate `I` never generated.\n        *   Therefore, the nonce *as used here* does **not** prevent impersonation or stop an attacker from triggering the responder's synchronization claim with a fresh, attacker-chosen nonce. It only potentially helps detect replays of *identical* messages if the responder maintains state.\n\n3.  **Key Components (`pk`, `sk`, `inversekeys`):** The description mentions public and secret keys and an `inversekeys` relationship that \"ensures that the public key can be used to derive the secret key.\"\n    *   **Evaluation:**\n        *   These key components are **not used** anywhere in the described message exchange (`I, R, ni`).\n        *   The described relationship `inversekeys(pk, sk)` allowing derivation of `sk` from `pk` is a **fundamental cryptographic flaw**. In any standard public-key system, the secret key *must* be computationally infeasible to derive from the public key. If `sk` can be derived from `pk`, then anyone knowing a party's public key can decrypt messages intended for them or forge their signatures.\n        *   While this specific protocol *doesn't use* the keys, the mention of this critical flaw, especially combined with the name \"carkeybrokenlim\" (suggesting a broken system possibly involving car keys with limitations), strongly implies that the underlying key management system intended for use with this protocol (or a related, perhaps more complete, version) is severely broken. This means *any* attempt to add cryptographic security (like encrypting the nonce or signing the message) using this flawed key system would also fail.\n\n4.  **Synchronization Claim (`claim_2(R, Nisynch)`):** The responder claims synchronization.\n    *   **Evaluation:** This is an internal claim by `R`. It signifies that `R` has received a message claiming to be from `I` containing a nonce `ni`. However, because the message is unauthenticated, this claim is **unreliable**. `R` does not have proof that the message actually came from `I` or that `I` intended to initiate a session at that moment. `R` is synchronizing based on easily forgeable information.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe `carkeybrokenlim` protocol, as described, is **not secure**. It fails to provide confidentiality, integrity, or authentication. An attacker can easily impersonate the initiator and trigger the responder's synchronization claim using attacker-controlled nonces.\n\nThe presence of a nonce is a nod towards freshness, but its effectiveness is completely undermined by the lack of authentication.\n\nFurthermore, the description highlights a severe, fundamental flaw in the associated key management system (`pk` can derive `sk`). While this flaw doesn't directly impact the *current*, crypto-less message exchange, it signifies that the foundation for adding cryptographic security using these keys is broken.\n\nThe name \"carkeybrokenlim\" is highly suggestive that this protocol (or a related one) might be intended for a system like a car key, and that it is indeed known to be broken, possibly due to the described key derivation weakness and/or the simple unauthenticated message exchange."]], "SPDL-1/carkey-ni2.spdl": [[true, "# SPDL file for protocol carkeyni\n# Derived directly from the provided protocol description\n\n# --- Intruder Knowledge ---\n# The intruder (i) is assumed to know all public keys.\n# Eve is explicitly marked as untrusted, meaning her secret key is known to the intruder.\ni, pk(Alice), pk(Bob), pk(Eve), sk(Eve)\n\n# --- Agents ---\n# The specific participants who can take on roles in the protocol.\nAlice, Bob, Eve\n\n# --- Nonces ---\n# Random values generated to ensure freshness.\nni, nc # 'nc' is listed as a nonce, though it is not explicitly used in the described messages.\n\n# --- Constants ---\n# Functions or relations that are static or globally known.\npk, sk, inversekeys\n\n# --- Protocol Description ---\n# Definition of the carkeyni protocol, specifying roles and the sequence of messages.\nprotocol carkeyni(I, R)\n{\n  # Role of the Initiator (I)\n  role I\n  {\n    fresh ni; # Initiator generates a fresh nonce for this run.\n\n    # Message 1: Initiator sends Responder's identity and the nonce,\n    # encrypted with the Initiator's secret key.\n    send_1 (enc(R, ni, sk(I)));\n\n    # Message 2: Initiator sends the identical message again.\n    send_2 (enc(R, ni, sk(I)));\n\n    # Claim by the Initiator regarding the protocol property (Nisynch).\n    claim I Nisynch;\n  }\n\n  # Role of the Responder (R)\n  role R\n  {\n    # Responder receives the first message from the Initiator.\n    # Implicitly, Responder would use pk(I) to decrypt and verify.\n    recv_1 (enc(R, ni, sk(I)));\n\n    # Responder receives the second message from the Initiator.\n    recv_2 (enc(R, ni, sk(I)));\n\n    # Claim by the Responder regarding the protocol property (Nisynch).\n    claim R Nisynch;\n  }\n}\n\n# --- Execution ---\n# Defines a sample execution trace of the protocol, assigning agents to roles.\n# The protocol description implies multiple executions are possible with different\n# agent assignments, but we define one specific trace for analysis.\nrun carkeyni(Alice, Bob) # Example run: Alice is Initiator, Bob is Responder.\n\n# --- Claims (as defined within roles) ---\n# The protocol description places the Nisynch claims directly within the role definitions.\n# These are already included above in the 'protocol' section.\n# claim I Nisynch;\n# claim R Nisynch;\n\n# --- Goal ---\n# The provided description does not specify a standard security goal\n# (e.g., secrecy of nonces, authentication of participants) for formal\n# verification tools.

HLPSL's `sym_key` type is used for this.\n2.  **Timestamps:** Timestamps (`T`) are modeled with the `timestamp` type. Their freshness is checked using `fresh(T, ExpiredTimeStamp)`.\n3.  **Nonces:** The nonce (`Nr`) used in the challenge-response is modeled with the `nonce` type.\n4.  **Message Structure:** Messages are built using tuples and encryption (`crypt`). The \"ticket\" `W` is specifically represented as a `ticket` type, which is just a generic `message` in HLPSL, as the initiator only forwards it without decrypting it.\n5.  **Security Claims:**\n    *   `secrecy_of Kir`: Ensures the session key remains confidential.\n    *   `authentication_on Kir`: Ensures both parties agree on the session key's value and source.\n    *   `authentication_on Nr`: Ensures mutual authentication using the nonce challenge-response.\n    *   `freshness_on Kir`: Ensures the session key is new and not a replay of an old key.\n    *   `witness` and `request` predicates are used within roles to specify what an agent believes it has agreed upon.\n\n```hlpsl\n% HLPSL for Denning-Sacco-Lowe Shared Key Protocol\n\n%

Let's break down its structure, identify potential weaknesses based on standard security protocol analysis, and discuss how it relates to the stated goal of \"arbitrary runs.\"\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of the `f5` Protocol\n\n**1. Protocol Flow (Step-by-Step):**\n\n*   **Initial State:** Both I and R are ready.\n*   **Step 1 (R -> I): Challenge**\n    *   R generates a fresh nonce, `N_R`.\n    *   R sends `N_R` to I.\n*   **Step 2 (I -> R): Response**\n    *   I receives `N_R`.\n    *   I signs `N_R` using its secret key `sk(I)`: `Sign(sk(I), N_R)`.\n    *   I sends `Sign(sk(I), N_R)` to R.\n*   **Step 3 (R -> I): Nested Encrypted Confirmation**\n    *   R receives `Sign(sk(I), N_R)`.\n    *   R generates a nested encryption of `N_R` using its secret key `sk(R)`. Let's denote this as `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)`. The description states \"encrypted multiple times,\" implying `enc(sk(R), enc(sk(R), ... enc(sk(R), N_R) ...))`. The *number* of layers is unspecified.\n    *   R sends `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)` to I.\n*   **Step 4 (I): State Change**\n    *   I receives `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)`.\n    *   If I successfully receives \"the expected nested response,\" it claims `Reachable`.\n\n**2. Identified Weaknesses and Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n\nBased on the description, several significant weaknesses are apparent, making the protocol fundamentally insecure for real-world authentication or secure communication beyond a mere demonstration.\n\n*   **a. Lack of Responder's Verification of Initiator's Signature:**\n    *   **Vulnerability:** After receiving `Sign(sk(I), N_R)` from I, the protocol description *does not state* that R verifies this signature using I's public key (`pk(I)`).\n    *   **Attack Scenario:** An attacker (A) could intercept `N_R` from R. A could then send `Sign(sk(A), N_R)` to R (i.e., sign the nonce with A's own key). Since R doesn't verify the signature, it would proceed to generate `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)` and send it back. R would mistakenly believe it's interacting with I, effectively allowing an **authentication bypass** for R.\n    *   **Impact:** R is spoofed into believing it's talking to I, potentially leaking information or performing actions on behalf of I.\n\n*   **b. Lack of Initiator's Decryption and Verification of Nested Response:**\n    *   **Vulnerability:** The description says I \"expects to receive a response that consists of a nested structure\" and \"If the initiator successfully receives the expected nested response, it claims that it has reached the desired state (`Reachable`).\" It *does not* state that I decrypts `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)` to verify that its *original nonce* (`N_R`) is indeed inside, or that it was genuinely encrypted by R's key.\n    *   **Attack Scenario:**\n        *   An attacker (A) could intercept `N_R` sent by R to I.\n        *   I sends `Sign(sk(I), N_R)` to R.\n        *   R sends `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)` to I.\n        *   `A` intercepts `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)`. `A` can then simply send *any* arbitrarily structured nested encrypted message to I (e.g., `enc(sk(A), enc(sk(A), N_arbitrary))`). If I *only* checks for the \"expected structure\" and not the content (i.e., whether `N_R` is actually inside and decrypted correctly), then I would falsely claim `Reachable`.\n        *   This effectively means the `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)` step offers **no authentication or freshness guarantee for I**, as I doesn't verify the content. It's just checking for a structural pattern.\n    *   **Impact:** I can be trivially fooled into believing the protocol finished successfully, even if the final message is not from R or doesn't contain the correct nonce.\n\n*   **c. Replay Attack on the Final Message (R -> I):**\n    *   **Vulnerability:** Since I doesn't verify the freshness of the `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)` message (by checking `N_R` inside), an attacker could record a legitimate `Nested_Enc_R(N_R)` message from a past run and replay it to I at any time. I would incorrectly declare `Reachable`.\n    *   **Impact:** False success state for I, potentially leading to incorrect assumptions about session validity or state.\n\n*   **d. Ambiguity of Nested Encryption Layers:**\n    *   **Vulnerability:** \"encrypted multiple times\" is vague. If the number of layers varies, it introduces complexity. If this number is not explicitly communicated or derivable, it could lead to parsing vulnerabilities (e.g., a \"padding oracle\" style attack if an attacker can control the number of layers and observe responses).\n    *   **Impact:** Potential for denial of service or information leakage if an attacker can manipulate the number of layers.\n\n*   **e. Lack of Mutual Authentication:**\n    *   Combining points (a) and (b), there is no strong mutual authentication. R doesn't authenticate I, and I doesn't properly authenticate R or the content of R's final message.\n\n**3. Relation to \"Arbitrary Runs\" (`-m2`, `-r5`):**\n\nThe description states the protocol \"illustrates that an arbitrary number of execution runs may be necessary to successfully identify vulnerabilities.\"\n\n*   **For the *obvious* flaws identified above:** Many of these vulnerabilities (lack of verification, simple replay) are apparent from a single, careful examination of the protocol's logic. You don't necessarily need multiple runs to find them. These are logical flaws in the design.\n\n*   **Where \"arbitrary runs\" *could* be relevant (if the protocol were more complex or subtle):**\n    *   **Race Conditions/Concurrency:** If there were multiple concurrent sessions or specific timing requirements, a vulnerability might only manifest when certain message interleavings occur. Multiple runs would be crucial for observing such intermittent failures.\n    *   **State-Dependent Attacks:** If the protocol involved internal state (e.g., counters, session IDs) that changed over time, a vulnerability might only appear after a certain number of runs or specific sequences of interactions.\n    *   **Resource Exhaustion:** Repeated runs could reveal vulnerabilities related to resource management (e.g., nonce exhaustion, memory leaks) in a specific implementation.\n    *   **Probabilistic Attacks:** If a vulnerability had a low probability of success on any single run, many repetitions would be needed to observe it.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe `f5` protocol, as described, serves its pedagogical purpose by being simple enough to highlight very common and fundamental security flaws in challenge-response mechanisms: namely, **insufficient verification of received messages and lack of proper mutual authentication.**\n\nWhile some of its flaws are immediately obvious, the protocol's stated aim of demonstrating the need for \"arbitrary runs\" might be pointing towards a more nuanced aspect not fully detailed, or suggesting that *after* fixing the glaring issues, the seemingly complex \"nested encryption\" part might hide more subtle vulnerabilities that only emerge under extensive testing or specific interaction patterns.\n\nFor real-world deployment, this protocol is highly insecure due to the lack of verification steps by both the initiator and the responder."]], "SPDL-1/gong-nonce-1.spdl": [[false, "```fsp\n// --- FSP Model for GongNonce Protocol ---\n\n// This FSP model represents a single successful execution trace of the GongNonce protocol.\n// It abstracts away the details of encryption/decryption by assuming that a party\n// can only 'receive' an encrypted message's content if they possess the correct decryption key.\n// Freshness of nonces and key parts is modeled by assigning unique constant values for this specific trace.\n\n// --- Data Types and Constants ---\n\n// Identifiers for protocol participants\nset IDENTIFIER = {I_ID, R_ID, S_ID}\n\n// Nonces - unique for this single protocol run\n// Ni_0: Initiator's nonce\n// Nr_0: Responder's nonce\nset NONCE_VALUES = {Ni_0, Nr_0}\n\n// Key Parts - unique for this single protocol run\n// Ki_0: Initiator's key part\n// Kr_0: Responder's key part\nset KEYPART_VALUES = {Ki_0, Kr_0}\n\n// Session Keys (pre-shared and constant for a given pair)\n// K_IS: Session key between Initiator (I) and Server (S)\n// K_RS: Session key between Responder (R) and Server (S)\n// These are not explicitly modeled as values passed in channels, but implied by\n// which party can successfully receive and process certain encrypted messages.\n\n// --- Channels (Message Signatures) ---\n// Each channel represents a specific message flow in the protocol.\n// The data carried in the channel reflects the *decrypted* content accessible by the recipient.\n\n// 1.

Here's an improved version, focusing on standard cryptographic terminology, clarity, and logical flow.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: IKEv1-SIG-A2 (Improved)\n\n**Overview:**\nThe IKEv1-SIG-A2 protocol is a signature-based variant of the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol, specifically resembling a simplified IKEv1 Main Mode with authentication. It's designed for secure, authenticated key exchange between two parties: an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R). The protocol establishes a shared secret using Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange and authenticates the exchange using digital signatures. It leverages hash functions, Pseudorandom Functions (PRFs), and Key Derivation Functions (KDFs) to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of subsequent communications.\n\n**Roles:**\n1.  **Initiator (I):**\n    *   Generates a fresh DH private exponent (`i`) and computes its public key (`G^i`).\n    *   Generates a fresh random nonce (`Ni`).\n    *   Generates a fresh \"cookie\" or ephemeral identifier (`Ci`) to bind messages.\n    *   Initiates the key exchange by sending its proposals and keying material.\n    *   Authenticates its identity and confirms the key exchange parameters to the Responder.\n    *   Claims various security properties upon successful completion.\n\n2.  **Responder (R):**\n    *   Generates a fresh DH private exponent (`r`) and computes its public key (`G^r`).\n    *   Generates a fresh random nonce (`Nr`).\n    *   Generates a fresh \"cookie\" or ephemeral identifier (`Cr`) to bind messages and deter DoS attacks.\n    *   Receives the Initiator's proposals and keying material.\n    *   Selects the agreed-upon security parameters.\n    *   Authenticates its identity and the key exchange to the Initiator.\n    *   Claims various security properties upon successful completion.\n\n**Cryptographic Primitives & Notation:**\n*   `G^x`: Diffie-Hellman public key, where `G` is the generator of a cyclic group and `x` is the private exponent.\n*   `i, r`: Private DH exponents of the Initiator and Responder, respectively.\n*   `Ni, Nr`: Nonces generated by the Initiator and Responder, respectively.\n*   `Ci, Cr`: \"Cookies\" or ephemeral identifiers generated by the Initiator and Responder, respectively.\n*   `I_ID, R_ID`: Identities of the Initiator and Responder (e.g., IP addresses, FQDNs).\n*   `Algo_List`: List of proposed cryptographic algorithms (e.g., encryption, hash, DH group, authentication method).\n*   `Algo_Chosen`: The algorithm set selected by the Responder.\n*   `shared_secret = (G^i)^r = (G^r)^i`: The shared Diffie-Hellman secret.\n*   `h(M)`: A cryptographic hash function (e.g., SHA-256) applied to message `M`.\n*   `prf(Key, Data)`: A Pseudorandom Function (e.g., HMAC) taking a key and data to produce a pseudorandom output.\n*   `Sig_X(M)`: Digital signature of message `M` by party `X` using their private signing key (`sk(X)`).\n*   `KDF(Input)`: Key Derivation Function, used to derive various session keys (e.g., for integrity, encryption) from the shared secret and other session parameters.\n\n**Message Flow (Simplified IKEv1 Main Mode):**\n\n1.  **Step 1 (I to R): SA Proposal & DH Public Key Exchange**\n    *   **I sends:** `Ci, I_ID, G^i, Ni, Algo_List`\n    *   **Purpose:** Initiator proposes security associations (`Algo_List`), sends its cookie (`Ci`), identity (`I_ID`), Diffie-Hellman public key (`G^i`), and a nonce (`Ni`).\n\n2.  **Step 2 (R to I): SA Acceptance, DH Public Key Exchange, and Responder Authentication**\n    *   **R computes:** `shared_secret = (G^i)^r`.\n    *   **R computes (for signature):**\n        `AuthData_R = prf(Ni || Nr || h(shared_secret) || G^i || G^r || Ci || Cr || Algo_Chosen || R_ID || I_ID)`\n        (Note: The original `prf` input was `prf(Ni, Nr, h(Gr, i), Gr, g(i), Cr, Ci, list, R)`. This is interpreted as `prf(Ni, Nr, h((G^r)^i), G^r, G^i, Cr, Ci, Algo_List, R_ID)`. We've added `I_ID` for completeness as it's common in IKE authentication.)\n    *   **R sends:** `Cr, R_ID, G^r, Nr, Algo_Chosen, Sig_R(AuthData_R)`\n    *   **Purpose:** Responder selects the cryptographic algorithms (`Algo_Chosen`), sends its cookie (`Cr`), identity (`R_ID`), Diffie-Hellman public key (`G^r`), and nonce (`Nr`). It then signs a derived value (`AuthData_R`) which cryptographically binds all key exchange parameters (nonces, DH keys, cookies, identities, chosen algorithms) to its identity, authenticating itself to the Initiator.\n\n3.  **Step 3 (I to R): Initiator Authentication**\n    *   **I computes:** `shared_secret = (G^r)^i`.\n    *   **I verifies:** The received `Sig_R(AuthData_R)` using R's public key. If verification fails, the protocol aborts.\n    *   **I computes (for signature):**\n        `AuthData_I = prf(Ni || Nr || h(shared_secret) || G^i || G^r || Ci || Cr || Algo_Chosen || I_ID || R_ID)`\n        (Note: This mirrors `AuthData_R`'s construction to ensure mutual agreement over the same parameters.)\n    *   **I sends:** `Ci, Cr, Sig_I(AuthData_I)`\n    *   **Purpose:** Initiator confirms the integrity of the Responder's message and verifies its authentication. Then, Initiator sends its signature (`Sig_I(AuthData_I)`) over the mutually agreed parameters, authenticating itself to the Responder.\n\n**Session Key Derivation (Implicit):**\nUpon successful completion of Step 3 (i.e., both parties have verified each other's signatures), both Initiator and Responder can independently derive a set of session keys. This is typically done in IKEv1 using the shared secret and other parameters:\n\n*   `SKEYID = prf(h(shared_secret), Ni || Nr)`\n*   Then, `SKEYID_d` (for deriving subsequent keys), `SKEYID_a` (for authentication), and `SKEYID_e` (for encryption) are derived from `SKEYID` using the KDF and other inputs (e.g., `Ni`, `Nr`, `Ci`, `Cr`). These keys are then used for integrity and confidentiality of Phase 2 messages and application data.\n\n**Security Properties (Claims):**\nThe protocol is designed to achieve and assert the following properties, often verified in formal analysis:\n*   **Running:** Both parties are actively participating in the session and have reached a specific point in the protocol.\n*   **SKR (Session Key Reveal):** The derived session key (`SKEYID` and its derivatives) is confidential and known only to the legitimate parties, even if an adversary compromises other session data.\n*   **Alive:** Both parties are confirmed to be alive and responsive, demonstrating active participation.\n*   **Weak Agreement:** Both parties agree on the session keys derived from the exchanged nonces, DH public keys, and other negotiation parameters.\n*   **Commit:** Both parties commit to the negotiated security parameters and the identity of their peer, ensuring integrity and preventing repudiation.\n\n---"]], "SPDL-1/ikev2-child-nopfs.spdl": [[false, "Based on the provided description, here's a formal specification of the `ikev2-child-nopfs` protocol, focusing on its core message exchanges and security properties without Perfect Forward Secrecy.\n\n---\n\n### Formal Protocol Specification: `ikev2-child-nopfs`\n\n#### 1.

The description says I needs to decrypt `{ Kap }pk(R)`. However, I *sent* `{ Kap }pk(R)` encrypted with R's public key and does *not* have R's private key to decrypt it. The Initiator *knows* `Kap` directly. So, based on the *logic* of having the necessary information, the Initiator *should* calculate `SKR = Kap XOR decrypt({ Kbp }pk(I))`.\n        *   **Responder:** Receives `{ Kap }pk(R)` (can decrypt to get `Kap`), holds `Kbp` (generated it). The description says R needs to decrypt `{ Kbp }pk(I)`. However, R *sent* `{ Kbp }pk(I)` encrypted with I's public key and does *not* have I's private key to decrypt it. The Responder *knows* `Kbp` directly. So, based on the *logic* of having the necessary information, the Responder *should* calculate `SKR = decrypt({ Kap }pk(R)) XOR Kbp`.\n    *   Assuming the parties can indeed perform the operations they are logically capable of (knowing their own nonce, decrypting what was sent to them), then:\n        *   I calculates `SKR = Kap XOR Kbp`.\n        *   R calculates `SKR = Kap XOR Kbp`.\n    *   Both parties arrive at the same key `SKR = Kap XOR Kbp`.\n    *   **Conclusion on Key Derivation:** The description of the key derivation step (`decrypt({ Kap }pk(R)) XOR decrypt({ Kbp }pk(I))`) is technically *incorrect* or misleading as neither party can perform *both* decryptions. The *intended* derivation is likely `Kap XOR Kbp`, using the nonce they know directly and the nonce they receive/decrypt.\n\n4.  **Security Claims Evaluation:**\n    *   **Freshness:** Since both `Kap` and `Kbp` are stated to be fresh nonces generated for each run, the resulting `SKR` (`Kap XOR Kbp`) will also be fresh for each run. This claim holds true *if* nonces are properly generated fresh.\n    *   **Replay Attacks:** Replaying Message 1 (`I, { Kap }pk(R)`) would cause R to generate a *new* `Kbp'` and respond with `R, { Kbp' }pk(I)`. The resulting key would be `Kap XOR Kbp'`, different from the original `Kap XOR Kbp`. Replaying Message 2 (`R, { Kbp }pk(I)`) without a corresponding Message 1 would be nonsensical to the Initiator (or lead to an error). So, the protocol seems resistant to simple replay of individual messages establishing the *same* key. The freshness of nonces is key here.\n\n5.  **Potential Vulnerabilities (Beyond Stated Claims):**\n    *   **Lack of Authentication / Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** This is the most significant weakness. The protocol does *not* authenticate the origin of the messages.\n        *   An attacker (M) can intercept `I, { Kap }pk(R)`.\n        *   M can send `M, { Km }pk(I)` to I, where `Km` is a nonce generated by M.\n        *   I receives `M, { Km }pk(I)`, decrypts `{ Km }pk(I)` to get `Km`, and calculates `SKR_I = Kap XOR Km`. I believes it has established a key with 'M' (or perhaps still believes it's R if it doesn't check the identity field properly, though the description says the identity is included). The critical point is that I derives a key based on its own nonce and the attacker's nonce. The attacker M *does not know* `Kap` (as it was encrypted for R) and therefore *cannot* calculate `SKR_I`.\n        *   Alternatively, M could forward `I, { Kap }pk(R)` to R. R receives it, generates `Kbp`, sends `R, { Kbp }pk(I)` back to I. I receives this, calculates `SKR = Kap XOR Kbp`. R calculates `SKR = Kap XOR Kbp`. A valid session key is established *between I and R*, but M could potentially interfere with subsequent communication using this key if the protocol doesn't immediately switch to using `SKR` for authenticated encryption. More importantly, M could have also launched the previous attack concurrently.\n        *   A stronger MitM: M intercepts `I, {Kap}pk(R)`. M sends `M, {Kap'}pk(R)` to R (where Kap' is a nonce M generated). R receives this, decrypts to get Kap', generates Kbp', sends `R, {Kbp'}pk(M)` to M. R calculates `SKR_R = Kap' XOR Kbp'`. M receives `R, {Kbp'}pk(M)`, decrypts to get Kbp', and calculates `SKR_M = Kap' XOR Kbp'`. M and R now share a key, and R thinks it's communicating with I. The attacker M has successfully established a session key with R, masquerading as I.\n\n    *   **The `send_Compromise` operation:** This operation is unusual in a protocol description unless it's meant to be used in a formal verification tool context (like ProVerif, where it might represent making a value available to the attacker *after* a certain point). If it implies the nonces are somehow made public *after* being sent, the protocol is broken as the session key relies on their secrecy. Assuming it's just a conceptual placeholder for \"generating and committing internally,\" it doesn't add security but also doesn't introduce a direct vulnerability itself unless misinterpreted.\n\n**Summary of Findings:**\n\n1.  The description of the key derivation step is flawed; neither party can perform the indicated operations (`decrypt({ Kap }pk(R))` by I, `decrypt({ Kbp }pk(I))` by R). The likely *intended* derivation is `SKR = Kap XOR Kbp` using the nonce known directly and the nonce received/decrypted.\n2.  Based on the *intended* key derivation, the protocol establishes a shared secret key `SKR = Kap XOR Kbp`.\n3.  The protocol successfully ensures freshness of the session key due to the use of fresh nonces.\n4.  The protocol is resistant to simple replays of individual messages.\n5.  **Major Vulnerability:** The protocol lacks authentication. It is highly vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks where an attacker can establish a session key with one party while impersonating the other, or influence the key derivation without being able to compute the resulting key themselves, leading to identity confusion and potential subsequent attacks.\n6.  The role of `send_Compromise` is unclear but doesn't appear to add cryptographic security based on the description alone.\n\nIn conclusion, while BCNP-1 uses nonces for freshness and public key encryption for confidentiality of the nonces in transit, its fundamental lack of authentication makes it insecure against active adversaries who can intercept and inject messages. A real-world secure protocol would need to add authentication steps, likely involving digital signatures or encrypting nonces under a shared secret derived from authenticated key exchange."]], "SPDL-1/isoiec-9798-2-3.spdl": [[true, "// SPDL file for \"Symmetric Two-Pass Mutual Authentication Protocol (keysymm-23)\"\n// and \"ISO/IEC 9798-2 Mutual Authentication Protocol (isoiec-9798-2-3)\"\n\n/////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////\n// Protocol 1: Symmetric Two-Pass Mutual Authentication Protocol (keysymm-23)\n//\n// Description from prompt:\n// - Roles: A, B\n// - Variables: Nonce (T), Ticket (Text)\n// - Message Flow:\n//   1.

To provide a formal representation, I will interpret the protocol steps to create the most coherent flow that attempts to satisfy the listed actions and claims, even if it highlights potential security flaws.\n\n**Interpretation Challenges and Key Assumptions:**\n\n1.  **Initiator's First Action:** The description for Role I states it \"Waits to receive...\" *before* \"Sends a message to the server...\". This is contradictory for an initiator. I will assume the \"Sends to Server\" message is the *actual* initiating step of the protocol.\n2.  **Session Key Transfer to Initiator:** Role I states it \"Receives... session keys `kir` and `kt` from the responder `R`\". For I to receive and then *use* `kir` (e.g., to decrypt `E_kir(...)`), `kir` and `kt` must be delivered either in the clear or encrypted with a key I already shares (e.g., `K_IS` from S, but R doesn't know `K_IS`). The most literal interpretation of \"from R\" implies R sends them. The *only way* I can get `kir` and `kt` from R and then use `kir` to decrypt R's message is if `kir` and `kt` are sent unencrypted by R in that message. **This is a critical security vulnerability for session keys.** I will model it this way to adhere to the literal description, but note its insecurity.\n3.  **Ticket `T2`:** `T2` is consistently mentioned as being received from `R` and then re-sent by `I`. Given `S` sends `E_KRS(I, R, ni, kir, kt)` to `R`, it's plausible `T2` refers to this opaque, server-generated ticket `E_KRS(...)` which `R` merely forwards to `I`. `I` would not be able to decrypt it but could use it as a token.\n\n---\n\n### Kao Chow Authentication Protocol v.3: Formal Specification\n\n#### Participants\n1.  **Initiator (I)**\n2.  **Responder (R)**\n3.  **Server (S)**\n\n#### Shared Secrets (Long-term Keys)\n*   $K_{IS}$: Shared secret key between Initiator (I) and Server (S).\n*   $K_{RS}$: Shared secret key between Responder (R) and Server (S).\n\n#### Session Keys (Generated by Server)\n*   $k_{ir}$: Session key for secure communication between I and R.\n*   $k_t$: Transport key (purpose not fully specified, but generated with $k_{ir}$).\n\n#### Nonces\n*   $n_i$: Nonce generated by Initiator (I).\n*   $n_r$: Nonce generated by Responder (R).\n\n#### Timestamps\n*   $t_r$: Timestamp generated by Responder (R).\n*   $t_S$: Timestamp generated by Server (S) for ticket validity.\n\n#### Tickets\n*   $T_{SR}$: A ticket generated by Server (S) for Responder (R), containing session key material. Formally: $E_{K_{RS}}(I, R, n_i, k_{ir}, k_t, t_S)$. This serves as $T_2$ in the initiator's description.\n\n---\n\n#### Protocol Steps (Interpreted Flow)\n\n**Message 1: Initiator requests session from Server**\n*   **I generates** $n_i$.\n*   **I $\\rightarrow$ S:** $I, R, n_i$\n    *   *(Matches Role I: \"Generates a fresh nonce $n_i$.

Sends a message to the responder R containing the secure message for authentication, which includes I, R, $n_i$, $k_{ir}$, and $k_t$.\" - This \"secure message\" is $T_{SR}$)*\n\n**Message 3: Responder delivers session keys and challenge to Initiator**\n*   **R receives** $T_{SR}$ from S.\n*   **R decrypts** $T_{SR}$ using $K_{RS}$ to obtain $I, R, n_i, k_{ir}, k_t, t_S$.\n*   **R verifies** $t_S$ for freshness/validity (not expired).\n*   **R generates** fresh $n_r$ and $t_r$.\n*   **R $\\rightarrow$ I:** $k_{ir}, k_t, E_{k_{ir}}(n_i, n_r, t_r), T_{SR}$\n    *   *(Matches Role R: \"Generates a fresh nonce $n_r$ and a timestamp $t_r$. Sends a message to the initiator I that contains the ticket [$T_{SR}$], the secure message with $n_i$, $k_{ir}$, and $n_r$ [$E_{k_{ir}}(n_i, n_r, t_r)$], and a signed message with the session key [implicitly $E_{k_{ir}}$].\")*\n    *   *(Matches Role I: \"Waits to receive a nonce $n_r$ and session keys $k_{ir}$ and $k_t$ from the responder R, along with a ticket $T_2$.\" - Here $T_2$ is $T_{SR}$, and $k_{ir}, k_t$ are sent in the clear as per the literal interpretation to allow I to receive them and decrypt the next part.)*\n\n**Message 4: Initiator confirms challenge to Responder**\n*   **I receives** $k_{ir}, k_t, E_{k_{ir}}(n_i', n_r, t_r'), T_{SR}'$.\n*   **I uses** $k_{ir}$ to decrypt $E_{k_{ir}}(n_i', n_r, t_r')$.\n*   **I verifies** $n_i'$ matches its own generated $n_i$.\n*   **I $\\rightarrow$ R:** $E_{k_{ir}}(n_r), T_{SR}$\n    *   *(Matches Role I: \"Sends a confirmation message to R that includes $n_r$ and $k_{ir}$, along with the ticket $T_2$.\" - Sending $k_{ir}$ again is redundant/unnecessary; assuming $E_{k_{ir}}(n_r)$ serves as proof of knowledge of $k_{ir}$ and $n_r$. $T_2$ is $T_{SR}$)*\n\n---\n\n#### Security Properties and Claims Analysis\n\nThe protocol aims to provide:\n*   **Mutual authentication:** Parties verify each other's identities.\n*   **Freshness of session keys:** Generated keys are new for each session.\n*   **Protection against replay attacks:** Use of nonces and timestamps.\n\nBased on the interpreted flow, here's how the claims map:\n\n**Claim I1: The initiator I ensures that it is not synchronized with the responder R.**\n*   **Formal Goal:** `I believes fresh(nr)`.\n*   **Justification:** I receives $n_r$ (from R) in Message 3 encrypted with $k_{ir}$ (which I believes is fresh from S via R). I then uses this $n_r$ in Message 4. If $k_{ir}$ is secure, this provides freshness.\n\n**Claim I2: The initiator I ensures agreement on the communication parameters with responder R.**\n*   **Formal Goal:** `I believes R.kir`, `I believes R.kt`, `I believes R.ni`, `I believes R.nr`.\n*   **Justification:** I receives $k_{ir}$ and $k_t$ from R (Message 3), and $n_r$ from R (Message 3). I verifies $n_i$ in R's message. If $k_{ir}$ and $k_t$ are trustworthy as received from R, agreement is established.\n\n**Claim I3: The initiator I possesses the secret session key $k_{ir}$.**\n*   **Formal Goal:** `I has kir`.\n*   **Justification:** I receives $k_{ir}$ in Message 3 and uses it to decrypt Message 3's payload and encrypt Message 4.\n\n**Claim I4: The initiator I verifies that the session key $k_{ir}$ is fresh and not compromised.**\n*   **Formal Goal:** `I believes fresh(kir)` and `I believes not compromised(kir)`.\n*   **Justification:** This is the most problematic claim. I receives $k_{ir}$ *in the clear* from R (Message 3). Therefore, I has no direct means to verify its freshness or non-compromise from S. An attacker could easily substitute a stale or known key here. If the intent was for `kir` to be encrypted with `K_IS` by S and sent directly to I, the description is misleading. As is, this claim is **not securely met** by the protocol.\n\n**Claim R1: The responder R ensures that it is not synchronized with the initiator I.**\n*   **Formal Goal:** `R believes fresh(ni)`.\n*   **Justification:** R receives $n_i$ from S (via $T_{SR}$ in Message 2) and confirms it matches in Message 3. If $n_i$ was fresh from I initially and protected by $K_{RS}$ and $k_{ir}$, R can believe I is live.\n\n**Claim R2: The responder R ensures agreement on the communication parameters with initiator I.**\n*   **Formal Goal:** `R believes I.ni`, `R believes I.nr`, `R believes I.kir`, `R believes I.kt`.\n*   **Justification:** R established $k_{ir}, k_t, n_i$ from the server's ticket (Message 2). R generated $n_r$ and received confirmation of it from I (Message 4) using $k_{ir}$.\n\n**Claim R3: The responder R possesses the secret session key $k_{ir}$.**\n*   **Formal Goal:** `R has kir`.\n*   **Justification:** R receives $k_{ir}$ from S (Message 2) encrypted with $K_{RS}$ and uses it for Message 3 and 4.\n\n**Claim R4: The responder R verifies that the session key $k_{ir}$ is fresh and not compromised.**\n*   **Formal Goal:** `R believes fresh(kir)` and `R believes not compromised(kir)`.\n*   **Justification:** R receives $k_{ir}$ from S (Message 2) encrypted with $K_{RS}$. If R trusts S and $K_{RS}$ is secure, R can believe $k_{ir}$ is fresh and not compromised *at creation*. The potential compromise happens when R sends it to I in Message 3.\n\n---\n\n#### Overall Security Assessment (Based on Interpreted Flow)\n\nThe protocol as interpreted is **fundamentally insecure for session key establishment** due to `k_ir` and `k_t` being transmitted in the clear in Message 3. An eavesdropper can capture these session keys, negating the claims of secrecy, freshness, and mutual authentication.\n\n*   **Mutual authentication:** Weakened significantly if `k_ir` is compromised, as an attacker could impersonate either I or R using the compromised key.\n*   **Freshness of the session keys:** The *generation* by S ensures freshness, but their *distribution* in the clear by R invalidates this property.\n*   **Protection against replay attacks:** The use of nonces ($n_i$, $n_r$) and timestamps ($t_r$, $t_S$) is present, but their effectiveness is severely undermined by the clear-text session key transmission. An attacker could replay Message 3 to an unsuspecting I, or use the stolen key to forge future messages."]], "SPDL-1/kaochow.spdl": [[false, "This review will assess the Kao Chow Authentication Protocol v.1 based on its description, identifying strengths, weaknesses, and potential vulnerabilities.\n\n## Kao Chow Authentication Protocol v.1 - Security Review\n\n### Executive Summary\n\nThe Kao Chow Authentication Protocol v.1 attempts to establish mutual authentication and a confidential session key between an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R) with the help of a Session Key Server (S). While it correctly identifies the need for nonces to ensure freshness, the protocol as described suffers from **critical fundamental flaws**, primarily the **complete omission of the session key (`kir`) generation and distribution mechanism**. Without a secure way for I and R to obtain `kir`, none of the stated security properties can be guaranteed, rendering the protocol non-functional and insecure.\n\n### Strengths\n\n1.  **Intent for Mutual Authentication:** The protocol aims for both I and R to authenticate each other, which is a desirable property.\n2.  **Use of Nonces (`ni`, `nr`):** The inclusion of nonces is a good practice to prevent replay attacks and ensure freshness of communication.\n3.  **Reliance on a Trusted Third Party (S):** Using a session key server (S) is a common and sound architectural choice for key management in distributed systems.\n\n### Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities\n\nThe following are significant issues that render the protocol insecure and impractical:\n\n1.  **CRITICAL: Missing Session Key (`kir`) Distribution:**\n    *   The most glaring flaw is the complete absence of any step where the Session Key Server (S) *generates* `kir` and *securely distributes* it to both the Initiator (I) and the Responder (R).\n    *   Steps 2 and 3 heavily rely on `kir` for encryption and decryption. Without a defined mechanism for I and R to possess `kir` securely and agree on its value, these steps are impossible to execute, and the `Secret (kir)` claim is unfounded.\n    *   **Vulnerability:** An attacker could easily impersonate either I or R because they don't need `kir` to try and mimic the protocol if `kir` isn't distributed, or if they guess or obtain it through out-of-band means due to lack of a secure distribution mechanism.\n\n2.  **Ambiguous \"via the session key server (S)\" in Step 1:**\n    *   \"I sends a message to R via S.\" This phrasing is unclear. Does S merely forward the message from I to R? Or does S process the message, add its own encryption/signature, and then forward it?\n    *   If S just forwards, R has no way to verify that the message indeed came from I (and not an imposter), only that it came from S.\n    *   The protocol does not define I's shared key with S, nor S's role in verifying I or R in the initial setup.\n\n3.  **Unclear Authentication for Responder (R) in Step 2:**\n    *   \"R receives the message from the initiator. It verifies the authenticity using a key shared with S.\"\n    *   This implies S authenticates I to R. However, how does R know that S has authenticated I, or that the message genuinely originated from I via S, and not from an attacker pretending to be S or I? The details of S's involvement in this authentication are missing.\n\n4.  **\"A message for the initiator (T)\" in Step 2 is Undefined:**\n    *   The purpose and content of `T` are not specified. Is it encrypted? Does it contain an ID? This ambiguity could lead to information leakage or missing authentication data.\n\n5.  **Nonce (`nr`) Sent in Clear in Step 3:**\n    *   After I decrypts `nr` in Step 3, it \"sends the decrypted nonce (nr) back to the responder (R).\"\n    *   If `nr` is sent *in the clear* (unencrypted), an attacker who captured the message from Step 2 could also capture `nr` and simply replay it in Step 3. This would allow an attacker to impersonate I in the final step, fooling R into believing I is authenticated.\n    *   To properly prove possession of `kir`, I should encrypt `nr` (or a derivative/hash of it) with `kir` in Step 3, or combine it with `ni` in a challenge-response.\n\n6.  **No Explicit Key Agreement on `kir`'s Value:**\n    *   Even if `kir` were distributed, the protocol doesn't describe how I and R *agree* on its specific value, only that they use it. This is tied to the missing distribution step.\n\n### Assessment of Claims\n\n*   **Nisynch**: Both parties are synchronized in their communication.\n    *   **Assessment: Partially true in intent, but not secure.** The use of nonces aims for synchronization. However, due to the missing `kir` distribution and the cleartext `nr` replay vulnerability, true *secure* synchronization and authentication of the parties involved is not achieved.\n*   **Niagree**: Both parties agree on the session parameters.\n    *   **Assessment: Not guaranteed.** The primary session parameter, `kir`, is never explicitly agreed upon securely, as its distribution is absent. Nonces are exchanged, but the agreement on who is who, secured by `kir`, is broken.\n*   **Secret (kir)**: Both parties possess the session key (kir) securely.\n    *   **Assessment: NOT TRUE.** The protocol completely fails to define how `kir` is made secret or how parties obtain it securely. This claim is entirely unfounded.\n*   **Empty (Fresh, kir)**: The session key (kir) is fresh and has not been compromised.\n    *   **Assessment: NOT TRUE.** Without a distribution mechanism, `kir`'s freshness cannot be guaranteed. It could be a static, pre-shared key (which isn't specified) or one that's trivially compromised if not securely generated and distributed by S per session.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Kao Chow Authentication Protocol v.1, as described, is **critically flawed and insecure**. Its fundamental reliance on a session key (`kir`) that is never generated or securely distributed makes it non-functional. Even if `kir` were somehow pre-shared, the vulnerabilities regarding `nr` being sent in the clear and the ambiguities in the initial messages would still undermine its security claims.\n\nThis protocol would need a significant redesign to address the missing key distribution, provide explicit authentication by S, and secure the final message exchange. It appears to be a very rudimentary sketch that lacks the essential cryptographic primitives and flow to be considered secure."]], "SPDL-1/localclaims.spdl": [[false, "The Local Claims Protocol, as described, is a very basic attempt at establishing a secret `nonce` between two parties using asymmetric encryption. While it has some foundational strengths, it suffers from significant weaknesses that would make it insecure in a real-world scenario.\n\nLet's break down its components and assess its security claims:\n\n### Strengths:\n\n1.  **Confidentiality of `ni` (against passive eavesdroppers):**\n    *   The core mechanism of encrypting `ni` with `pk(R)` ensures that only the intended responder (R), who possesses `sk(R)`, can decrypt and retrieve `ni`. A passive eavesdropper observing `send_1(I,R, {ni}pk(R))` cannot learn `ni` without `sk(R)`. This achieves the primary secrecy claim against a listener.\n\n2.  **Simplicity:**\n    *   The protocol is extremely simple, involving only two steps and one message exchange.\n\n### Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities:\n\n1.  **Lack of Initiator Authentication (Critical Flaw):**\n    *   **The most significant vulnerability.** R receives `{ni}pk(R)`. While R can decrypt `ni`, R has no way to verify that the message actually originated from I. An attacker (A) could easily generate their own nonce `ni_A`, encrypt it with `pk(R)` (which is public), and send `send_1(A,R, {ni_A}pk(R))`. R would decrypt `ni_A`, believe it came from I, and claim knowledge of a secret supposedly from I. This completely undermines the authenticity of the nonce and the identity of the initiator.\n    *   The statement \"The responder can then verify the authenticity of the nonce to ensure it was indeed generated by the initiator\" is **false** based on the described steps. R cannot verify I's authenticity.\n\n2.  **Weak Replay Attack Prevention:**\n    *   The protocol states `ni` is \"used once to ensure freshness and prevent replay attacks.\" However, the protocol itself provides **no mechanism** for R to detect replays. If an attacker intercepts `send_1(I,R, {ni}pk(R))` and re-sends it at a later time, R will simply decrypt it again, retrieve the same `ni`, and proceed as if it's a new, fresh message from I (which it already falsely assumes anyway due to the authentication issue).\n    *   To prevent replay attacks, R would need to maintain state (e.g., a list of seen nonces) or the protocol would need to incorporate timestamps or challenge-response mechanisms.\n\n3.  **No Mutual Authentication:**\n    *   I never verifies R's identity, and as discussed, R cannot verify I's identity. This is a one-way (and flawed) confidentiality channel for `ni`, not a secure communication establishment protocol.\n\n4.  **No Forward Secrecy:**\n    *   If `sk(R)` is ever compromised in the future, all past communications where `ni` was encrypted with `pk(R)` would be compromised, revealing the `ni` values. This is inherent to simple public-key encryption without ephemeral keys.\n\n5.  **\"Claims\" are not proof:**\n    *   The `claim_i1(I, Secret, ni)` and `claim_r1(R, Secret, ni)` statements are just declarations within the protocol's logic. They don't inherently provide cryptographic proof to an external observer or even to the other party unless accompanied by verifiable cryptographic operations (like digital signatures).\n\n### Improvements:\n\nTo make this protocol more robust and address the critical flaws, especially authentication and replay protection, standard cryptographic practices would need to be integrated:\n\n1.  **Initiator Authentication (Digital Signatures):**\n    *   I should sign the message, or at least the nonce, with its private key `sk(I)`.\n    *   **Revised Step 1:** `send_1(I,R, {ni}pk(R), Signature_I(hash(ni, I, R)))` (I signs the nonce and relevant context with `sk(I)`).\n    *   **Revised Step 2:** Upon decryption, R would then verify `Signature_I` using `pk(I)`. If the signature is valid, R can be confident that the message truly originated from I.\n\n2.  **Replay Protection (Challenge-Response or Timestamps):**\n    *   **Challenge-Response:** R could generate its own nonce (`nr`), encrypt it with `pk(I)`, and send it back to I. I would then decrypt `nr`, combine it with `ni`, sign the combined value, encrypt it, and send it back to R. This ensures freshness and mutual authentication.\n    *   **Timestamps:** I could include a timestamp in the message, and R would check if the timestamp is recent and within an acceptable skew. This requires synchronized clocks.\n\n3.  **Mutual Authentication:**\n    *   If R also needs to prove its identity to I, then R would similarly sign a message back to I using `sk(R)`.\n\n### Conclusion:\n\nThe Local Claims Protocol, as described, successfully demonstrates the *confidentiality* aspect of public-key encryption for a single piece of data (`ni`) against passive eavesdropping. However, it completely **fails at authentication** of the initiator and provides **no effective replay protection**. The claims made regarding \"authenticity of the nonce\" and \"prevention of replay attacks\" are largely unsupported by the protocol's mechanics.\n\nIn its current form, this protocol is highly vulnerable to impersonation attacks and message replay, making it unsuitable for secure communication where sender identity and message freshness are important. It serves as a good pedagogical example of how simply encrypting data is insufficient for secure protocol design without proper authentication and freshness mechanisms."]], "SPDL-1/needham-schroeder.spdl": [[false, "The provided description of the Needham-Schroeder Public Key Protocol offers a good high-level overview, but it has some significant inaccuracies and omissions, particularly concerning the exact steps, the specific type of attacks it's vulnerable to, and how it differs from the canonical version.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the critique and proposed improvements:\n\n### Critique of the Current Description\n\n1.  **Protocol Steps (Accuracy & Fidelity to Canonical NSPK):**\n    *   **Step 2: \"Key Distribution\"** - \"encrypted with the Server's private key\". This phrasing is problematic. Encryption with a private key is typically a signature operation (digital signature) for authenticity, not for confidentiality. If the intent is for the server to *sign* a certificate for R's public key, that's correct, but \"encrypted\" is misleading. More importantly, in the *canonical* Needham-Schroeder Public Key protocol, the public key distribution often happens *before* the session initiation, or the server provides a *signed certificate* for the *other party's* public key when requested, rather than encrypting the key itself. The canonical NSPK usually starts with I sending a message *directly to R*. The sequence described deviates significantly from the widely accepted version of NSPK, which is crucial for understanding its famous vulnerability.\n    *   **\"Session Key Creation\" (Step 3):** The protocol, as described, primarily focuses on mutual authentication and nonce exchange, which *enables* a session key to be derived later, but it doesn't explicitly derive or establish a shared secret session key within these steps. The message `{Ni, I}PkR` serves to prove I's freshness and identity to R, not directly create a session key.\n    *   **Overall Flow:** The described flow is a hybrid and not the most widely recognized version of NSPK. The canonical NSPK focuses on I and R obtaining *signed certificates* for each other's public keys from S, and then using those *known* public keys for direct communication.\n\n2.  **Vulnerabilities (Specificity):**\n    *   \"vulnerable to certain types of attacks, including man-in-the-middle attacks, if the public keys are not properly authenticated.\" While true for *any* PKI setup, this isn't the *famous* and specific vulnerability of the Needham-Schroeder Public Key Protocol. The most well-known flaw is a *reflection attack* discovered by Gavin Lowe.\n    *   \"Replay attacks can occur if the server's responses are intercepted and reused.\" Given the nonces, replay of *entire sessions* is generally prevented. The specific replay attack it's vulnerable to is more subtle and involves an attacker reflecting a nonce from an old session.\n\n3.  **Claims:**\n    *   \"The Initiator claims the secrecy of its nonce (Ni) and the Responder's nonce (Nr).\" Nonces are primarily for *freshness* and *uniqueness*, not secrecy. They are sent in plaintext (or encrypted with the *other party's* public key, making them visible to the intended recipient, but not secretly shared between I and R in the way a session key would be).\n\n### Proposed Improvements\n\nTo make the description more accurate, comprehensive, and illustrative of the protocol's real-world implications (including its famous vulnerability and fix), I suggest the following changes:\n\n---\n\n### Needham-Schroeder Public Key Protocol Description (Revised)\n\nThe Needham-Schroeder Public Key Protocol (NSPK) is a foundational cryptographic protocol designed to allow two entities, referred to as I (Initiator) and R (Responder), to establish *mutual authentication* and *freshness* using public-key cryptography. It relies on a trusted Server (S) that acts as a Public Key Authority (PKA) to distribute and certify public keys. While the protocol primarily achieves mutual authentication, it sets the stage for a subsequent secure communication channel or shared session key establishment.\n\n#### Roles:\n1.  **Initiator (I)**: The party that initiates the communication with the Responder.\n2.  **Responder (R)**: The party that responds to the Initiator's request.\n3.  **Server (S)**: The trusted server that manages and distributes *signed certificates* for public keys. It is assumed that I and R already possess the Server's public key (PkS) to verify its signatures.\n\n#### Steps of the Protocol (Canonical Version):\n\nThe canonical Needham-Schroeder Public Key Protocol typically proceeds as follows, often assuming I and R obtain each other's public keys (signed by S) *before* or *during* the initial phases:\n\n1.  **Initiator's Request to Responder**: The Initiator (I) sends a message to the Responder (R) including its identity, and a fresh nonce (Ni) generated by I. This message is encrypted with R's public key.\n    *   `I -> R: {Ni, I}PkR`\n\n2.  **Responder's Authentication & Challenge**: The Responder (R) decrypts the message, verifies Ni and I's identity. To establish its own freshness and challenge I, R then generates its own fresh nonce (Nr) and sends both nonces back to I, encrypted with I's public key.\n    *   `R -> I: {Ni, Nr}PkI`\n\n3.  **Initiator's Confirmation**: The Initiator (I) decrypts the message, verifies Ni (confirming R is indeed responding to its challenge). I then sends back R's nonce (Nr) to R, encrypted with R's public key, to confirm its own identity and freshness to R.\n    *   `I -> R: {Nr}PkR`\n\n#### Claims:\n-   Both parties assert that they have successfully authenticated each other and that the current session is fresh (i.e., not a replay of an old session), ensured by the exchange of nonces.\n-   The protocol establishes confidence that I and R are communicating with the intended partner.\n\n### Security Features:\n-   **Nonces**: Nonces (Ni, Nr) are crucial for ensuring the *freshness* of messages and helping prevent replay attacks.\n-   **Public Key Cryptography**: Ensures confidentiality and authentication between I and R, once their public keys are trusted.\n-   **Trusted Server (PKI)**: The involvement of a trusted server for public key distribution (e.g., providing signed certificates) is essential for authenticating the public keys themselves, preventing man-in-the-middle attacks where an attacker substitutes public keys.\n\n### Potential Vulnerabilities & Famous Attack:\nWhile robust in many aspects, the original Needham-Schroeder Public Key Protocol is famously vulnerable to a specific type of attack discovered by Gavin Lowe:\n\n*   **Reflection Attack (Lowe's Attack)**: The vulnerability lies in the final message (Step 3: `{Nr}PkR`). Because this message does not include the Initiator's identity (`I`), an attacker (A) can exploit this.\n    *   **Scenario:**\n        1.  `I -> A (posing as R): {Ni, I}PkA` (I initiates a session with A, thinking A is R)\n        2.  `A (as R) -> I: {Ni, Nr}PkI` (A responds to I, using a nonce Nr)\n        3.  `I -> A (as R): {Nr}PkR` (I sends Nr back, but this message is *not* bound to I's identity)\n        *   An attacker `A` can now take this message `{Nr}PkR` and reflect it back to a *real* Responder `R` in a *separate, legitimate* session that `A` initiates with `R`. `R` will believe `A` is `I` because `A` has successfully sent `R`'s challenge (`Nr`) back, even though `A` never decrypted `Nr` (it was decrypted by `I`). This tricks `R` into believing `A` is `I`.\n\n### Lowe's Fix for Needham-Schroeder Public Key:\nTo prevent Lowe's reflection attack, the final message (Step 3) is modified to include the Initiator's identity:\n\n*   `I -> R: {Nr, I}PkR`\n\nBy including `I`'s identity in the final message, the Responder `R` can confirm that the `Nr` it receives is indeed from the original Initiator `I`, and not an attacker reflecting a nonce from a different session.\n\n---"]], "SPDL-1/ns3-1.spdl": [[false, "Here's a summary of the Needham-Schroeder Protocol based on the provided description:\n\n### Needham-Schroeder Protocol Summary\n\nThe Needham-Schroeder protocol is an authentication mechanism designed for two parties, an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R), to establish a secure communication channel.

When `input` changes, the old `has-input` predicate is removed, and a new one with the updated value is added.\n    *   `message-in-transit`: Models a message being \"sent\" but not yet \"received.\"\n    *   `protocol-step-X-completed`: Boolean flags to enforce the sequential order of the protocol steps.\n    *   `secret-claimed`: Indicates that a specific agent has successfully claimed a piece of data as secret.\n5.  **`(:action ...)`**: Defines the possible actions (operators) that can be performed by agents. Each action has:\n    *   **`:parameters`**: The variables that the action operates on (e.g., `?agent`, `?initial-data`).\n    *   **`:precondition`**: A logical condition that must be true for the action to be executable. This includes state checks (`has-input`), sequential flags (`protocol-step-1-completed`), and ensuring actions aren't repeated (`not (secret-claimed)`).\n    *   **`:effect`**: The changes to the state of the world that occur when the action is executed. This involves adding (`predicate`) or deleting (`not (predicate)`) predicates.\n\n**How it models the protocol:**\n\n*   **`input` variable**: Represented by the `(has-input ?agent ?value)` predicate. When the `input` variable \"changes\" (as in `recv_!3`), the PDDL models this by deleting the old `has-input` predicate and adding a new one with the updated value.\n*   **Message Exchange**: `send_!2` creates a `message-in-transit` predicate, and `recv_!3` consumes it (removes it from the state), ensuring the message exists before it can be received.\n*   **Sequential Steps**: The `protocol-step-X-completed` predicates are crucial for enforcing the described sequence of actions (`recv_!1` -> `send_!2` -> `recv_!3` -> `claim_4`).\n*   **Claim**: The `claim-secret` action requires the `input` to be at its final state (`HalloString` in the example trace) and marks the `secret-claimed` predicate as true.\n\nThis PDDL representation allows an AI planner to find a sequence of actions from an initial state to a goal state, demonstrating the protocol's execution."]], "SPDL-1/otwayrees.spdl": [[false, "Below is the AVISPA HLPSL (High-Level Protocol Specification Language) description for the Otway-Rees protocol, based on the provided natural language description and common interpretations of the protocol.\n\nI've made a few clarifications and assumptions to align with standard Otway-Rees protocol formalizations:\n*   The \"message (M)\" in the description is typically an identifier for the session or purpose, often just the initiator/responder IDs.

This is crucial for `prepak` confidentiality.\n    *   `s_enc` / `s_dec`: Models symmetric encryption, though not used for actual data encryption in *this* protocol, it's there to properly type `prepak` as a `symmetric_key` for the `SKR` query.\n3.  **MS_Role Process**:\n    *   Generates `msrand` and `said`.\n    *   Sends `sign((msrand, said, id_ms), sk_ms)`.\n    *   Receives the BS's response (`m2_signed`).\n    *   Uses `get_msg` with `pk_bs` to verify the BS's signature and extract `(msrand_rec, bsrand, enc_prepak, id_ms_rec)`.\n    *   Crucially, it **verifies** `msrand_rec = msrand`. This check is vital for preventing replay attacks and ensuring liveness.\n    *   Uses `adec` with `sk_ms` to decrypt `enc_prepak` and obtain `prepak`.\n    *   Sets `ms_sk_established` and `ms_synched` events.\n    *   Sends the final acknowledgment `sign(bsrand, sk_ms)`.\n4.  **BS_Role Process**:\n    *   Receives the MS's initial message (`m1_signed`).\n    *   Uses `get_msg` with `pk_ms` to verify the MS's signature and extract `(msrand, said, id_ms_rec)`.\n    *   Sets `bs_agrees_said` event.\n    *   Generates `bsrand` and `prepak`.\n    *   **Encrypts `prepak` with `pk_ms` using `aenc`** for confidentiality.\n    *   Sends `sign((msrand, bsrand, enc_prepak, id_ms_rec), sk_bs)`.\n    *   Receives the MS's final acknowledgment (`m3_signed`).\n    *   Uses `get_msg` with `pk_ms` to verify MS's signature and extract `bsrand_rec`.\n    *   Crucially, it **verifies** `bsrand_rec = bsrand`.\n    *   Sets `bs_sk_established` and `bs_synched` events.\n5.  **Main Process**:\n    *   Initializes private and public keys (`sk_ms`, `pk_ms`, `sk_bs`, `pk_bs`) and identities (`id_ms`, `id_bs`).\n    *   Uses `!` to indicate that multiple instances of `MS_Role` and `BS_Role` can run concurrently, simulating an open network where an attacker can interleave messages.\n6.  **Claims (Queries)**:\n    *   **`Niagree`**: Checks if the MS and BS agree on the session parameters (`msrand`, `said`). `inj-fresh` ensures that each event corresponds to a unique run. If MS starts a unique session (`ms_init`), does BS agree (`bs_agrees_said`) to that *same unique* session? And vice-versa.\n    *   **`Nisynch`**: Checks if both MS and BS successfully complete the handshake and reach a synchronized state where they both believe the session is established and the nonces (`msrand`, `bsrand`) are synchronized. `inj-fresh` again ensures uniqueness.\n    *   **`SKR` (Session Key Revelation)**: `query attacker: prepak.` asks ProVerif if the attacker can ever learn the value of `prepak`. If the result is \"false\", it means `prepak` remains confidential.\n\nThis ProVerif model allows for a formal security analysis of PKMv2-RSA against an active attacker."]], "SPDL-1/pkmv2satek.spdl": [[true, "# Scyther Protocol Description Language\n# Protocol: PKMv2-SA-TEK\n# Description:\n# PKMv2-SA-TEK is a security protocol designed for establishing a secure\n# communication channel between a Mobile Station (MS) and a Base Station (BS).\n# The protocol is focused on the generation and distribution of temporary\n# encryption keys (TEKs) while ensuring mutual authentication and\n# synchronization between the parties involved.\n\n# User-defined types\nusertype nonce;

Let's analyze its effectiveness against its stated goals.\n\n### Analysis of Security Goals\n\n1.  **\"ensure that the nonce generated by the Initiator remains confidential\"**:\n    *   The message `{I, ni}pk(R)` is encrypted using the public key of the Responder (`pk(R)`).\n    *   Only the Responder, possessing the corresponding private key (`sk(R)`), can decrypt this message and learn `ni`.\n    *   An eavesdropping adversary who intercepts this message would not be able to decrypt it without `sk(R)`.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Yes, the protocol successfully ensures the confidentiality of `ni` from any external party (e.g., an eavesdropper).\n\n2.  **\"can only be correctly claimed by the Responder after it has been transmitted securely through encryption\"**:\n    *   The Responder claims `secret(ni)` *after* decrypting the message. This means the Responder has successfully learned `ni`.\n    *   Since decryption requires `sk(R)`, only the legitimate Responder (who holds `sk(R)`) can perform this decryption and thus correctly claim knowledge of `ni` based on receiving it via this encrypted channel.\n    *   Any other party attempting to claim `secret(ni)` based on intercepting the message `{I, ni}pk(R)` would fail because they cannot decrypt it.\n    *   **Conclusion:** Yes, the protocol ensures that `ni` can only be claimed (i.e., known) by the legitimate Responder after its secure transmission.\n\n### Additional Considerations and Potential Improvements (Beyond Stated Goals)\n\nWhile the protocol *strictly* achieves its stated secrecy goals, it's worth noting common security aspects that are often critical in real-world protocols but are not addressed here:\n\n1.  **Authentication of Initiator to Responder:**\n    *   The Responder receives `ni` and claims it secret. However, the Responder has no cryptographic assurance that the message `{I, ni}pk(R)` was *actually* sent by the legitimate Initiator `I`. The message contains `I`'s identity inside the encrypted part, but anyone knowing `R`'s public key could construct `{I, ni'}pk(R)` and send it to `R`. `R` would then decrypt `ni'` and believe it came from `I`.\n    *   This is an **authentication weakness**. If `R` needs to be sure that `I` is the actual sender, this protocol does not provide that guarantee. To address this, `I` would typically sign the message, e.g., `{I, ni}pk(R), Sig(I, {I, ni}pk(R))`.\n\n2.  **Freshness of `ni` from Responder's Perspective:**\n    *   `ni` is fresh when generated by `I`. However, there's no mechanism for `R` to verify the freshness of `ni` in the context of the current session or to detect replays if `R` needed to ensure `ni` was specific to this particular interaction. For a simple secrecy nonce, this might not be critical, but for session establishment or key exchange, it would be.\n\n3.  **Proof of Knowledge/Possession for `I`:**\n    *   The protocol does not provide `I` with a way to prove to `R` (or anyone else) that `I` is the legitimate generator of `ni` or that `I` still knows `ni` after sending it. A subsequent step would be needed for `I` to prove knowledge of `ni` to `R`.\n\n### Summary\n\nThe \"Secrecy Protocol Using Asymmetric Encryption\" effectively achieves its core security goals:\n*   It ensures that the nonce `ni` remains confidential from eavesdroppers.\n*   It guarantees that only the legitimate Responder can learn and therefore \"claim\" knowledge of `ni` through this protocol step.\n\nIt serves as a fundamental building block for confidentiality, but for complete secure communication, it would typically be augmented with authentication mechanisms."]], "SPDL-1/protocol1.spdl": [[false, "To model `protocol1` in ProVerif, we define the types, cryptographic primitives, communication channels, and the processes for the Initiator and Responder roles.

Let's break it down for a comprehensive analysis.\n\n### Analysis of SmartRight View-Only Protocol\n\n#### 1. Overview and Assumptions\n\n*   **Goal:** Secure communication (confidentiality, integrity) between Initiator (I) and Responder (R).\n*   **Core Mechanism:** Relies on symmetric key cryptography, specifically a pre-shared key `k(I,R)` between I and R for the initial handshake, and a session key `VoKey` established during the protocol for subsequent communication.\n*   **Implicit Assumption:** A secure channel for the initial key exchange of `k(I,R)` (or derivation) is assumed, as is common in such protocols.\n\n#### 2. Component Analysis\n\n*   **Key Types:**\n    *   `SessionKey`: `VoKey` is correctly used as a fresh session key for subsequent encryption, enhancing forward secrecy compared to relying solely on `k(I,R)`.\n    *   `XorKey`: `VoR` is a fresh XOR key, and `Vor` (constant XorKey) is mentioned but not explicitly used in the message flow as a separate entity from `VoR`. This is a bit confusing; it seems `Vor` is just a typo for `VoR` or a general term for that type of key. Assuming `VoR` is the specific instance used.\n*   **Fresh Variables:**\n    *   `VoKey` (I-generated): Good, ensures freshness for session encryption.\n    *   `VoR` (I-generated): Fresh, used to mask `CW`. Its handling is central to the protocol's weakness.\n    *   `CW` (Confidential Information): The data to be protected.\n    *   `VoRi` (R-generated Nonce): Good, ensures R's liveness and acts as a challenge to I.\n\n#### 3. Message Flow Analysis\n\n*   **Message 1 (I -> R): `E(k(I,R), {VoKey, CW XOR VoR})`**\n    *   **Confidentiality:** `VoKey` and `CW XOR VoR` are confidential due to encryption with the shared `k(I,R)`.\n    *   **Authentication/Integrity:** R can be assured that the message originated from I and has not been tampered with, assuming `k(I,R)` is strong and unique to I and R.\n    *   **Purpose:** I establishes `VoKey` with R and sends `CW` in a masked form.\n\n*   **Message 2 (R -> I): `VoRi`**\n    *   **Purpose:** R provides a fresh nonce (`VoRi`) to I. This acts as a challenge to I, requiring I to demonstrate knowledge of `VoRi` to prove its liveness and that it received R's response.\n    *   **Confidentiality/Integrity:** Sent in the clear. This is acceptable for a nonce unless its value is sensitive or needs to be authenticated.\n\n*   **Message 3 (I -> R): `VoR, E(VoKey, {hash(VoRi)})`**\n    *   **Purpose:** I sends back `VoR` (in the clear) and demonstrates knowledge of `VoRi` and `VoKey`.\n    *   **Integrity Check (for `VoRi` and `VoKey` knowledge):** R can decrypt `E(VoKey, {hash(VoRi)})` using the `VoKey` received in Message 1. R then computes `hash(VoRi)` from its own `VoRi` and compares. A match confirms I possesses `VoKey` and has processed R's `VoRi`, ensuring I's liveness and participation.\n    *   **`VoR` in clear:** This is the critical point of vulnerability, as identified in the description's security note.\n\n*   **Claim (R): `Nisynch`**\n    *   R claims synchronization. For R to make this claim, it must:\n        1.  Receive `VoKey` and `CW XOR VoR` securely from I (Msg 1).\n        2.  Send `VoRi` to I (Msg 2).\n        3.  Receive `VoR` and `E(VoKey, {hash(VoRi)})` from I (Msg 3).\n        4.  Successfully decrypt `E(VoKey, {hash(VoRi)})` using `VoKey` and verify `hash(VoRi)`.\n        5.  Recover `CW` by XORing `(CW XOR VoR)` (from Msg 1) with `VoR` (from Msg 3).\n\n#### 4. Security Considerations and Vulnerabilities\n\nThe description explicitly mentions a Scyther-found attack, which is very helpful.\n\n*   **Vulnerability: Integrity of `CW` due to `VoR` substitution**\n    *   **Mechanism:** In Message 3, `VoR` is sent in the clear. An active attacker (M) can intercept Message 3 and replace `VoR` with an arbitrary value `VoR_M` (where `VoR_M != VoR`). The attacker then forwards `VoR_M, E(VoKey, {hash(VoRi)})` to R.\n    *   **Impact:**\n        *   R receives `VoR_M` (the manipulated value).\n        *   R will correctly verify `hash(VoRi)` using `VoKey` (which was securely established in Message 1). This part of the message is protected by `VoKey`.\n        *   However, when R attempts to recover `CW`, R computes `CW_recovered = (CW XOR VoR) XOR VoR_M`.\n        *   Since `VoR_M != VoR`, the recovered `CW_recovered` will be different from the original `CW` (`CW_recovered = CW XOR (VoR XOR VoR_M)`).\n    *   **Result:** The attacker has successfully manipulated `CW` without R detecting the alteration. This is a severe integrity violation for `CW`.\n    *   **Root Cause:** `VoR` is not cryptographically bound to the session or authenticated in Message 3. Its integrity relies solely on being sent in the clear, which is inherently insecure against active attackers.\n\n*   **Ambiguity of \"View-Only\":** The protocol describes an active exchange where R sends a nonce (`VoRi`) and I uses it. If \"view-only\" means R only observes and does not respond, then Message 2 and 3 would not exist in this form, or R would not generate `VoRi`. As described, it's an active exchange, not merely passive viewing.\n\n#### 5. Strengths\n\n*   **Confidentiality:** Initial session key `VoKey` and `CW` (masked) are protected by the pre-shared `k(I,R)`. `hash(VoRi)` is protected by `VoKey`.\n*   **Freshness:** Use of fresh variables (`VoKey`, `VoR`, `CW`, `VoRi`) helps prevent replay attacks and ensures session uniqueness.\n*   **Liveness/Challenge-Response:** The `VoRi` nonce and its hashed encryption in Message 3 provide a basic challenge-response mechanism, ensuring both parties are live and have received previous messages.\n*   **Session Key Establishment:** `VoKey` is securely established for use in the session, which is good practice.\n\n#### 6. Proposed Improvements\n\nThe primary weakness is the integrity of `VoR` and thus `CW`.\n\n1.  **Protect `VoR` in Message 3:**\n    *   Instead of sending `VoR` in the clear, it should be included within the encrypted part of Message 3, using `VoKey`.\n    *   **Revised Message 3 (I -> R):** `E(VoKey, {VoR, hash(VoRi)})`\n    *   **Reasoning:** Since R already knows `VoKey` from Message 1, R can decrypt this message. Encrypting `VoR` with `VoKey` ensures that `VoR` cannot be tampered with by an attacker without breaking `VoKey` (which is assumed to be secure). This binds the `VoR` used to mask `CW` to the authenticated `VoKey` and `VoRi` response.\n\n2.  **Simplify `CW` Transfer (Alternative Design):**\n    *   The `CW XOR VoR` mechanism feels unnecessarily complex if `VoR`'s only purpose is to mask `CW` and then be revealed. If `CW` needs to be confidential and then revealed to R, consider:\n        *   **Option A (Direct `CW` transfer in Msg 1):**\n            *   **Message 1 (I -> R):** `E(k(I,R), {VoKey, CW})`\n            *   **Message 2 (R -> I):** `VoRi`\n            *   **Message 3 (I -> R):** `E(VoKey, {hash(VoRi)})`\n            *   **Benefit:** Simpler, and `CW`'s integrity is directly tied to the strong `k(I,R)`. No `VoR` needed for `CW`. `VoR` could be removed entirely unless it serves another, undefined purpose.\n        *   **Option B (Delayed `CW` transfer):** If `CW` should only be revealed after R's challenge:\n            *   **Message 1 (I -> R):** `E(k(I,R), {VoKey})`\n            *   **Message 2 (R -> I):** `VoRi`\n            *   **Message 3 (I -> R):** `E(VoKey, {CW, hash(VoRi)})`\n            *   **Benefit:** `CW` is protected by `VoKey` and only sent after the challenge, ensuring I's liveness.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nThe SmartRight View-Only protocol as described has good intentions for confidentiality and freshness. However, its primary vulnerability lies in the unauthenticated transmission of `VoR` in Message 3, which directly compromises the integrity of `CW`. Implementing the proposed improvement of encrypting `VoR` (along with `hash(VoRi)`) using the session key `VoKey` in Message 3 would effectively mitigate this specific attack and significantly strengthen the protocol's security against active adversaries. The ambiguity of \"view-only\" also suggests a need for clearer definition if it implies specific limitations on Responder actions."]], "SPDL-1/speedtest-1.spdl": [[false, "To formally specify the `ns3speedtest` protocol for security analysis, we will use a common notation inspired by Dolev-Yao models and process calculi (like ProVerif).\n\n---\n\n### Formal Specification: ns3speedtest Protocol\n\n**1.

Let's analyze its strengths, the validity of its claims, and identify potential vulnerabilities.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of spliceAS-HC Protocol\n\n#### Strengths\n\n1.  **Mutual Authentication (Partial):**\n    *   **S to I (Step 2):** S authenticates itself to I by signing the message with its secret key, including I's nonce (N1) to prevent replay.\n    *   **R to I (Step 6):** R authenticates itself to I by demonstrating knowledge of N2 (via `{N2}inc`), which was encrypted only for R in Step 3.\n    *   **S to R (Step 5):** S authenticates itself to R by signing the message with its secret key, including R's nonce (N3).\n2.  **Freshness and Replay Protection:**\n    *   The use of nonces (N1, N2, N3) helps in preventing replay attacks.\n    *   N1 ensures the freshness of S's response to I (Step 2).\n    *   N2 (and `{N2}inc`) ensures the freshness of R's response to I (Step 6).\n    *   N3 ensures the freshness of S's response to R (Step 5).\n3.  **Confidentiality (of Nonces):**\n    *   N2 is encrypted with R's public key (Step 3), ensuring only R can read it.\n    *   `{N2}inc` is encrypted with I's public key (Step 6), ensuring only I can read it.\n4.  **Role of the Server:** The server acts as a trusted third party, relaying public keys and authenticating certain steps in the communication flow.\n\n#### Analysis of Claims\n\nLet's evaluate each claim based on the protocol steps:\n\n*   **Claim 1: The initiator (I) can establish that it possesses a secret related to nonce (N2).**\n    *   **Validity:** This claim is trivially true. The initiator (I) *generates* N2 in Step 3. Therefore, I inherently \"possesses\" the secret related to N2. A more meaningful claim would be \"I can establish that *R* possesses a secret related to N2 (i.e., knowledge of N2)\".\n    *   **Refined Interpretation (and actual protocol achievement):** I can verify that R *received and decrypted* N2 because R returns `{N2}inc` encrypted for I. This confirms R's possession of N2.\n\n*   **Claim 2: The initiator (I) can affirm agreement on nonces (Niagree).**\n    *   **Validity:** Partially true.\n        *   **Agreement on N1:** I sends N1 in Step 1, and S returns N1 in Step 2 (signed by S). I can confirm S has N1. So, I and S agree on N1.\n        *   **Agreement on N2:** I sends N2 to R (encrypted) in Step 3. R returns `{N2}inc` (encrypted) in Step 6. I can verify R's knowledge of N2. So, I and R agree on N2.\n        *   **Agreement on N3:** I does *not* see N3 in any message. Therefore, I cannot affirm agreement on N3 with anyone.\n    *   **Conclusion:** I can affirm agreement on N1 (with S) and N2 (with R), but not N3.\n\n*   **Claim 3: The initiator (I) can verify synchronization (Nisynch).**\n    *   **Validity:** True.\n        *   The use of N1 (sent by I, returned by S) ensures I is synchronized with S regarding the current session attempt.\n        *   The use of N2 (sent by I, returned by R as `{N2}inc`) ensures I is synchronized with R regarding the current session.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The nonces provide sufficient freshness indicators for I to verify synchronization with both S and R within the context of their respective exchanges.\n\n*   **Claim 4: The responder (R) can establish that it possesses a secret related to nonce (N2).**\n    *   **Validity:** True. R receives `{N2}_PK_R` in Step 3, decrypts it to obtain N2. R then demonstrates this knowledge by sending `{N2}inc` in Step 6. This confirms R's possession of N2.\n\n*   **Claim 5: The responder (R) can affirm agreement on nonces (Niagree).**\n    *   **Validity:** Partially true.\n        *   **Agreement on N2:** R receives N2 from I (after decryption) and returns `{N2}inc` to I. R can confirm I sent N2. So, R and I agree on N2.\n        *   **Agreement on N3:** R sends N3 in Step 4, and S returns N3 (signed by S) in Step 5. R can confirm S has N3. So, R and S agree on N3.\n        *   **Agreement on N1:** R does *not* see N1 in any message. Therefore, R cannot affirm agreement on N1 with anyone.\n    *   **Conclusion:** R can affirm agreement on N2 (with I) and N3 (with S), but not N1.\n\n*   **Claim 6: The responder (R) can verify synchronization (Nisynch).**\n    *   **Validity:** True.\n        *   R receives a fresh N2 from I in Step 3, indicating I's intent.\n        *   R sends N3 to S in Step 4, and S returns N3 (signed) in Step 5, ensuring R is synchronized with S for that part of the exchange.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The nonces N2 and N3 provide R with sufficient freshness indicators to verify synchronization with I and S respectively.\n\n#### Identified Vulnerabilities and Weaknesses\n\n1.  **Lack of Authentication of I to R in Step 3:**\n    *   **Vulnerability:** In Step 3 (I to R): `I, R, {N2}_PK_R, T, L`. While N2 is encrypted for R, the identities `I` and `R`, plus `T` and `L`, are sent in plaintext. An attacker (M) could impersonate I by sending `I_M, R, {N2_M}_PK_R, T, L` to R. R would decrypt `N2_M` (as it's encrypted for R) and proceed with the protocol, believing it's communicating with the legitimate `I_M`.\n    *   **Consequence:** This allows an attacker to initiate a session with R, potentially leading to R engaging in communication with a malicious party while believing it's talking to the legitimate initiator. The responder has no cryptographic proof that the message came from the claimed initiator.\n    *   **Fix:** The entire message or at least the critical components (I, R, N2, T, L) in Step 3 should be signed by I using I's secret key, so R can verify I's authenticity. For example: `I, R, {N2}_PK_R, T, L, {Hash(I, R, N2, T, L)}_SK_I`.\n\n2.  **Weak Authentication of R to S in Step 4:**\n    *   **Vulnerability:** In Step 4 (R to S): `N3`. N3 is sent in plaintext without any authentication of R. An attacker (M) can intercept any N3 sent by R or simply send an arbitrary nonce (N3_M) to S, claiming to be R.\n    *   **Consequence:** S has no way to verify that N3 came from the legitimate R. This could allow an attacker to trick S into thinking R is requesting something, potentially causing S to send information to the wrong party (though S signs its response in Step 5, which helps R verify S, it doesn't help S verify R in Step 4).\n    *   **Fix:** Step 4 should include an authenticated identity of R, signed by R. For example: `{{R, N3}_SK_R}` or `R, {N3}_PK_S`.\n\n3.  **Ambiguous Use of TimeStamp (T) and LifeTime (L):**\n    *   **Vulnerability:** T and L are sent in Step 3, but the protocol description does not specify how R or I should use them. If R does not verify T against current time or L for validity, a stale message could potentially be accepted, although N2 provides freshness for the specific message.\n    *   **Consequence:** Without clear validation rules, T and L might be redundant or fail to provide their intended security benefits.\n    *   **Fix:** Explicitly state the verification rules for T and L. E.g., \"R must verify that T is within a reasonable timeframe (e.g., last 5 minutes) and that L defines a valid session duration, rejecting messages that fail these checks.\"\n\n4.  **\"Possession of Secret\" Claim Wording:** As noted under Claim 1, the wording is awkward. It should focus on *verification* of possession by the *other* party.\n\n#### Recommendations for Improvement\n\n1.  **Authenticate Initiator in Step 3:** Modify Step 3 to include a digital signature from I, allowing R to verify I's identity.\n    *   **Step 3 (I to R - Modified):** `I, R, T, L, {N2}_PK_R, {Hash(I, R, N2, T, L)}_SK_I`\n2.  **Authenticate Responder in Step 4:** Modify Step 4 to include a digital signature from R, allowing S to verify R's identity.\n    *   **Step 4 (R to S - Modified):** `R, {N3}_SK_R` or `R, {N3}_PK_S` (if S needs N3 to be confidential from others).\n3.  **Define T and L Usage:** Add explicit instructions for how R (and potentially I) should validate the TimeStamp (T) and LifeTime (L) values.\n4.  **Clarify Claim Wording:** Rephrase Claim 1 to reflect that I verifies R's knowledge of N2, rather than I's own trivial possession.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe `spliceAS-HC` protocol makes good use of nonces and public-key cryptography to establish freshness and partial authentication. However, it suffers from significant vulnerabilities due to a lack of proper authentication in two critical steps (I to R in Step 3, and R to S in Step 4). Without these fixes, an attacker could impersonate I to R, or impersonate R to S, undermining the protocol's integrity. The stated claims are largely achieved, though some are trivially true or partially fulfilled. Implementing the suggested improvements would significantly enhance the protocol's security by ensuring stronger mutual authentication and preventing impersonation attacks."]], "SPDL-1/SR3.spdl": [[false, "Let's analyze the SR3 protocol based on the provided description.\n\n---\n\n### Analysis of SR3 Protocol\n\n**1. Roles and Key Components Overview:**\n\n*   **V (Verifier):** Initiator of the communication, aims to authenticate itself to S and establish liveness.\n*   **S (Server):** Responder, aims to authenticate V and confirm reception.\n*   **Nv (Nonce):** Freshness value from V to prevent replay attacks on V's side.\n*   **D (Ticket):** A credential for V to prove its identity/authorization to S.\n*   **k(V,S) (Shared Key):** A symmetric key shared between V and S, used for encryption.\n*   **H (Hash Function):** Cryptographic hash for integrity (though its application here is questionable).\n\n**2. Protocol Flow Breakdown:**\n\n**Message 1: V -> S**\n`V, E_k(V,S) (D, Nv), H(Nv)`\n\n*   **V's Intent:** To prove knowledge of `k(V,S)` and possession of `D` and `Nv` to S. The encryption `E_k(V,S)` is meant to provide confidentiality and implicitly, if using authenticated encryption, integrity for `D` and `Nv`.\n*   **Analysis of `H(Nv)`:** Sending `H(Nv)` *outside* the encryption `E_k(V,S)(D, Nv)` is problematic and often redundant.\n    *   If `E_k(V,S)` is an authenticated encryption scheme (like AES-GCM), the integrity of `Nv` (and `D`) within the ciphertext is already guaranteed. `H(Nv)` is superfluous.\n    *   If `E_k(V,S)` is merely a confidentiality-only encryption (e.g., raw AES-CBC without HMAC), then `H(Nv)` outside the ciphertext does *not* ensure the integrity of `Nv` itself. An attacker could intercept `V, E_k(V,S)(D, Nv), H(Nv_original)`, and replace `H(Nv_original)` with `H(garbage)`. S would decrypt `Nv_original`, calculate `H(Nv_original)`, compare it to `H(garbage)`, and fail. While this prevents the attacker from arbitrarily forging a valid `H(Nv)`, it doesn't add a robustness that a proper MAC or authenticated encryption wouldn't already provide for the entire message. It's an awkward design choice.\n\n**Message 2: S -> V**\n`Nv, V` (assuming plaintext, as no encryption or hashing is specified)\n\n*   **S's Intent:** To confirm reception and processing of V's message by echoing `Nv` and `V` back.\n*   **Analysis:** This is the weakest point of the protocol. The response from S is sent in plaintext and provides no cryptographic proof that it actually originated from the legitimate server S. An attacker could simply capture V's initial message, forward it to S, wait for S's plaintext `Nv, V` reply, and then forward that reply back to V. V would then falsely believe it has successfully authenticated S.\n\n**3. Evaluation of Claims:**\n\nLet's assess if the claims are supported by the protocol flow, considering the identified weaknesses.\n\n**Verifier Claims (V):**\n\n*   **Claim V1 (V agrees with S):** **Weakly Supported.** V receives `Nv` back, which shows S processed its message. However, because S's response is unauthenticated, V doesn't know for sure it's S it's agreeing with.\n*   **Claim V2 (V has a secret associated with the ticket (D)):** **Supported.** V generates/uses `D` and sends it encrypted. This is a claim V makes about itself and proves it to S by successful encryption.\n*   **Claim V3 (V has a secret associated with the session key (k(V, S))):** **Supported.** V uses `k(V,S)` for encryption. If S successfully decrypts, it proves V knows `k(V,S)`.\n*   **Claim V4 (V is in sync with S):** **Partially Supported.** The `Nv` exchange helps with basic liveness and synchronization for the nonce, preventing simple replay of V's first message. However, the lack of authentication in S's response makes deeper synchronization vulnerable to manipulation.\n*   **Claim V5 (V has a secret associated with the nonce (Nv)):** **Supported.** V generates `Nv` itself, so it naturally has it. This is a self-claim.\n\n**Server Claims (S):**\n\n*   **Claim S1 (S agrees with V):** **Supported.** S receives V's message, processes it, and responds. This indicates S's agreement to participate in the session.\n*   **Claim S2 (S has a secret associated with the ticket (D)):** **Ambiguous/Weakly Supported.** S *receives* `D` from V. For S to claim a secret *associated* with `D`, S would typically need to validate `D` (e.g., check it against a database of valid tickets or derive a key from it). The description doesn't explicitly state S performs such validation. If S just decrypts and uses `D` without validation, then S doesn't necessarily \"have a secret associated with D\" in a meaningful sense beyond having received it.\n*   **Claim S3 (S has a secret associated with the session key (k(V, S))):** **Supported.** S uses `k(V,S)` to decrypt V's message. Successful decryption proves S knows `k(V,S)`.\n*   **Claim S4 (S is in sync with V):** **Partially Supported.** S receives the message, extracts `Nv` and `D`, and replies with `Nv`. This indicates S is following the protocol flow.\n*   **Claim S5 (S has a secret associated with the nonce (Nv)):** **Weakly Supported.** S *receives* `Nv` as part of the session. `Nv` is a fresh value generated by V, not a long-term secret for S. S \"knows\" Nv for the duration of the session, but it's not a secret S \"has\" in the same way it has `k(V,S)`.\n\n**4. Evaluation of Security Goals:**\n\n*   **Mutual Authentication:**\n    *   **V authenticates S:** **FAIL.** S's response `Nv, V` is unauthenticated. An attacker can easily impersonate S to V by forwarding messages or replaying previous unauthenticated `Nv, V` pairs. V has no cryptographic assurance that the `Nv, V` it received actually came from the legitimate S.\n    *   **S authenticates V:** **SUCCESS.** S receives `E_k(V,S)(D, Nv)`. If `k(V,S)` is genuinely a key shared *only* between V and S, and S can decrypt it, then S is assured that V is the legitimate party who knows `k(V,S)`. If S also validates `D` as a valid credential, this further strengthens S's authentication of V.\n\n*   **Protecting the integrity of the messages exchanged:**\n    *   **V -> S message:** The encrypted part `E_k(V,S)(D, Nv)` offers integrity if authenticated encryption is used. The `H(Nv)` outside is poorly placed and contributes little practical integrity beyond what authenticated encryption already provides.\n    *   **S -> V message:** **FAIL.** The message `Nv, V` is in plaintext and carries no integrity protection. It can be easily tampered with by an attacker.\n\n*   **Ensuring that both parties are synchronized:**\n    *   The nonce `Nv` helps V detect replays of its own message and ensures S is responsive. However, due to the lack of authentication and integrity of S's response, an attacker could desynchronize V by sending a forged `Nv, V` message.\n    *   **Conclusion:** **Weakly Supported.** Synchronization is vulnerable due to the lack of strong authentication and integrity in S's response.\n\n*   **Establishing shared secrets:**\n    *   The protocol *uses* a pre-existing shared key `k(V,S)`. It does not *establish* a new session key.\n    *   `D` is a credential, implying it's also a form of shared secret if S recognizes and validates it.\n    *   `Nv` becomes a shared piece of information for the session, but it's not a long-term secret.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The protocol relies on *pre-existing* shared secrets (`k(V,S)` and implicitly `D`). It doesn't establish new ones.\n\n**5. Identified Weaknesses and Vulnerabilities:**\n\n1.  **Lack of Server Authentication (Critical):** The most significant flaw. V has no way to cryptographically verify that it is communicating with the legitimate server S.\n2.  **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept all communications, forward V's message to S, receive S's unauthenticated response, and forward it to V. V will believe it has authenticated S, but all communication will be observable and potentially modifiable by the attacker.\n3.  **No Integrity on S's Response:** S's response `Nv, V` is sent in plaintext, allowing an attacker to alter or replay it.\n4.  **Redundant/Misplaced `H(Nv)`:** If `E_k(V,S)` is authenticated encryption, `H(Nv)` is unnecessary. If not, its placement outside the encryption is poor for full integrity protection of `Nv` itself.\n5.  **Ambiguity of \"Fresh Ticket (D)\":** The description states V generates a \"fresh ticket (D)\". This conflicts with \"A credential issued to the verifier.\" If D is a credential, it's typically long-lived and reused, not generated fresh per session. This impacts the meaning of \"secret associated with D.\" Assuming it means \"uses its existing ticket D in a fresh session.\"\n6.  **No explicit validation of D by S:** The protocol description doesn't state S *validates* `D` (e.g., checks if it's a valid, unexpired credential). Without this, an attacker might replay an old `D` if they somehow obtain it, or S might not truly gain assurance about V's legitimacy via `D`.\n\n**6. Suggested Improvements:**\n\nTo achieve mutual authentication and message integrity, the protocol needs significant changes:\n\n1.  **Server Authentication to V:** S *must* cryptographically prove its identity to V. This can be done by:\n    *   Encrypting its response with `k(V,S)`: `E_k(V,S) (Nv, V_id_from_S, /* other session info */)` or by\n    *   Signing its response with its private key (if asymmetric cryptography is used).\n2.  **Authenticated Encryption:** Ensure that `E_k(V,S)` refers to an authenticated encryption mode (e.g., AES-GCM or AES-CBC with HMAC-SHA256). This would remove the need for `H(Nv)`.\n3.  **Nonce from S:** For strong mutual authentication, S should also generate a fresh nonce (Ns) and send it to V within an authenticated message. V would then need to return Ns in a subsequent message, demonstrating S's liveness and that V is communicating with *that specific* S.\n4.  **Explicit Validation:** Clearly state that S decrypts and *validates* `D` (e.g., checking it against a database or cryptographic properties).\n\n**Example of an Improved Flow (incorporating a nonce from S):**\n\n1.  **V -> S:** `V, E_k(V,S) (D, Nv)` (using authenticated encryption)\n2.  **S (decrypts, validates D, generates Ns):**\n    `S -> V: E_k(V,S) (Nv, Ns)` (using authenticated encryption)\n3.  **V (decrypts, validates Nv, validates Ns):**\n    `V -> S: E_k(V,S) (Ns)` (using authenticated encryption)\n\nThis modified flow would provide much stronger mutual authentication and integrity.\n\n---\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe SR3 protocol, as described, successfully allows the Server (S) to authenticate the Verifier (V). However, it critically **fails to provide authentication of the Server (S) to the Verifier (V)**. This makes the protocol vulnerable to Man-in-the-Middle attacks and compromises message integrity for the server's response. The claims of mutual agreement and synchronization are therefore significantly weakened. The placement and purpose of `H(Nv)` also highlight a design inefficiency. For practical use, the protocol would require substantial modifications, particularly in the server's response mechanism."]], "SPDL-1/bkepk-ce-1.spdl": [[false, "```prolog\n% This is a SPAN/OFMC model for the Bilateral Key Exchange with Public Key (bkeCE) protocol.\n% It is based on the description provided.\n\n% --- SPAN/OFMC Directives ---\n% USE_SIMULATOR: yes\n% USE_A\u653b\u51fb\u8005NALYZE: yes\n\n% --- Types ---\ntypes: principal, nonce, key, iden, hash_val, message;\n\n% --- Constants ---\n% Principals Alice and Bob\nconst: A, B: principal;\n% Identifiers for Alice and Bob\nconst: idA, idB: iden;\n\n% --- Functions/Operators ---\n% Public key encryption: encrypt(message, public_key)\nfun: pub_encrypt/2;\n% Symmetric key encryption: encrypt(message, symmetric_key)\nfun: sym_encrypt/2;\n% Hashing: hash(value)\nfun: hash/1;\n% Tuple construction: tuple(item1, item2, ...)\nfun: tuple/2, tuple/3, tuple/4;\n\n% --- Inverse Functions for Decryption ---\n% Inverse for public key encryption: decrypt(ciphertext, private_key)\ninverse_fun: dec/2;\n% Inverse for symmetric key encryption: decrypt(ciphertext, symmetric_key)\ninverse_fun: sdec/2;\n\n% --- Equational Theory ---\n% Define how decryption works for public and symmetric keys\n% dec(pub_encrypt(m, k), inverse_key(k)) = m\n% sdec(sym_encrypt(m, k), k) = m\n% inverse_key(private_key) = public_key (defined implicitly by bind)\n% We need specific rules for tuple decryption if decryption is defined opaquely\nequ: dec(pub_encrypt(tuple(x1, x2), pk), sk) = tuple(dec(pub_encrypt(x1, pk), sk), dec(pub_encrypt(x2, pk), sk));

The key is to be very specific about how Scyther models these elements and to highlight any notation that might be unusual in a standard cryptographic sense.\n\n### Refined Description of the Protocol\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Name:** STS-MAC\n\n**Overview:**\nThe STS-MAC (Secure Ticketing System with Message Authentication Code) protocol aims to establish a shared secret session key and ensure mutual authentication between two parties, the Initiator (I) and the Responder (R). It appears to leverage principles of Diffie-Hellman key exchange for public key generation and utilizes Message Authentication Codes (MACs) and digital signatures for message integrity and authenticity. The protocol focuses on establishing a shared secret (`SKR`) and authenticating the exchange, rather than direct encrypted data communication.\n\n**Roles:**\n1.  **Initiator (I):** The party that initiates the communication.\n2.  **Responder (R):** The party that responds to the initiator.\n\n*Scyther-Specific Modeling Elements:*\n3.  **Oracle (O):** In Scyther, this often represents a trusted third party or a source for key registration/distribution. It's not a direct participant role like I or R in the message flow.\n4.  **Diffie-Hellman (DH):** This refers to the underlying Diffie-Hellman group and operations used for generating public/private key pairs and shared secrets. It's a cryptographic construct Scyther supports, not a distinct protocol role.\n5.  **SWAP:** A Scyther-specific construct that can signify a state change, a specific phase of the protocol, or an exchange of values, particularly related to derived keys or session setup. It's not a separate \"protocol.\"\n\n**Cryptographic Functions:**\n*   **`g`:** Used in expressions like `g(i)` and `g(r)`. While the overview suggests Diffie-Hellman (where `g` is a group generator and `g(x)` typically means `g^x`), the notation `g(x)` could imply a hash function over `x` if `g` is defined as such in the SPDL. For consistency with a DH-like exchange, we'll interpret `g(i)` as the Initiator's public Diffie-Hellman share (e.g., `Gi = g^i`) and `g(r)` (or `Gr`) as the Responder's public share (`Gr = g^r`), where `i` and `r` are their respective private exponents.\n*   **`h`:** A hash function used for deriving MAC keys.\n*   **`KDF`:** A Key Derivation Function, used to derive the final session key.\n*   **`MAC`:** A Message Authentication Code function, taking a key and the message to be authenticated.\n*   **`sign(Agent, Message)`:** Represents a digital signature by `Agent` over `Message`.\n\n**Messages:**\n*Note:* The original description uses `send_!2` and `recv_!3`. In Scyther, `!` typically denotes a private variable (e.g., `!i` for a nonce `i` that should remain private). If these were meant as literal message numbers, they should be simple integers. We will interpret them as sequential messages. `Gr` is assumed to be `g(r)`.\n\n1.  **Message 1 (From Initiator I to Responder R):**\n    *   Initiator `I` sends its Diffie-Hellman public share: `g(i)`\n    *   *Scyther Representation:* `I -> R: g(i)`\n\n2.  **Message 2 (From Responder R to Initiator I):**\n    *   Responder `R` sends its Diffie-Hellman public share: `g(r)` (referred to as `Gr` in the original description).\n    *   `R` sends a digital signature by `R` over a tuple containing `Gr` and `g(i)`.\n    *   `R` sends a MAC, using `h(Gr,i)` as the key, over a tuple containing `Gr` and `g(i)`.\n        *   **Note on `MAC` key:** The MAC key `h(Gr,i)` literally includes `i` (Initiator's private exponent). This is problematic for `R` to compute without knowing `i`. It is highly probable that `i` should instead be `g(i)` (Initiator's public key), or that the key derivation `h` should operate on the shared secret `g^(ir)` for proper mutual authentication. The description adheres to the literal input for recreation purposes, but flags this as a potential logical inconsistency in a real-world protocol.\n    *   *Scyther Representation:* `R -> I: Gr, sign(R, Gr, g(i)), mac(h(Gr,i), Gr, g(i))`\n\n3.  **Message 3 (From Initiator I to Responder R):**\n    *   Initiator `I` sends a digital signature by `I` over a tuple containing `g(i)` and `Gr`.\n    *   `I` sends a MAC, using `h(Gr,i)` as the key, over a tuple containing `g(i)` and `Gr`.\n        *   **Note on `MAC` key:** Similar to Message 2, the use of `h(Gr,i)` as the MAC key is consistent for the Initiator (who knows `i`). However, for the Responder to verify this MAC, they would also need to compute `h(Gr,i)`, which means they would need to know `i` (the Initiator's private exponent), or the key should be derived from the shared secret.\n    *   *Scyther Representation:* `I -> R: sign(I, g(i), Gr), mac(h(Gr,i), g(i), Gr)`\n\n**Claims:**\nBoth roles (I and R) make the following claims, which Scyther uses to verify security properties:\n\n*   **`claim(SKR, KDF(h(Gr,i)))`**: Both I and R claim to possess or agree on the shared secret key `SKR`, which is defined as `KDF(h(Gr,i))`.\n    *   **Note:** As with the MAC keys, if `i` is the private exponent, this specific key derivation `KDF(h(Gr,i))` is primarily computable by `I` (who knows `i`). For `R` to make this claim for a *shared* secret, `R` would also need `i`, which is not standard. This points to a potential misrepresentation in the original definition of the shared key, or `i` refers to a publicly exchanged value.\n*   **`claim(Alive)`**: A liveness claim, indicating that the other party is actively participating in the protocol run.\n*   **`claim(Weakagree)`**: A weak agreement claim, meaning that both parties have agreed on the same set of values for the session key and other key parameters, and that those values originated from the intended participants.\n\n---\n\nThis refined description clearly separates standard protocol elements from Scyther-specific modeling constructs and highlights areas where the described notation might deviate from typical cryptographic practices, which is crucial for accurate analysis and recreation."]], "SPDL-1/th-1seq2.spdl": [[false, "The `nsl3th3` protocol can be formally described and analyzed using the ProVerif tool.

So, Alice knows (`Ka`, `Kb`).\n        *   Bob generates `Kb` and sends it to Simon. He receives a notification but *never* receives `Ka` (or any other key material) from Simon or Alice. So, Bob only knows (`Kb`).\n        *   Simon knows both (`Ka`, `Kb`).\n    *   **Conclusion:** Alice and Bob *do not* end up with a shared secret. Alice knows `Kb`, but Bob does not know `Ka`. For them to communicate securely using a shared secret derived from these keys, Bob would need to possess `Ka`, or they would need to establish a *new* shared key based on `Ka` and `Kb` (which is not described).\n\n2.  **Incorrect Claims about Key Secrecy:**\n\n    *   **Claim by Alice:** \"Alice claims that `Ka` is a secret only known to her.\"\n        *   **Reality:** Alice generates `Ka`, sends it to Simon (`{Ka}pk(S)`), and Simon decrypts it. Therefore, `Ka` is known to **Alice and Simon**. This claim is false.\n    *   **Claim by Bob:** \"Bob claims that `Kb` is a secret only known to him.\"\n        *   **Reality:** Bob generates `Kb`, sends it to Simon (`{Kb}pk(S)`), and Simon decrypts it. Therefore, `Kb` is known to **Bob and Simon**. This claim is false.\n    *   **Claim by Simon:** \"Simon claims that `Ka` is a secret known only to him.\"\n        *   **Reality:** Simon receives `Ka` from Alice and uses it to encrypt `Kb` for Alice (`{Kb}Ka`). Alice then decrypts this. Therefore, `Ka` is known to **Alice and Simon**. This claim is false.\n\n    *   **Summary of Claims:** All \"only known to\" claims are incorrect because Simon always knows both `Ka` and `Kb`, and Alice knows `Ka`.\n\n3.  **Inaccurate Security Properties:**\n\n    *   **Property:** \"Only Alice and Bob can derive and access their respective keys.\"\n        *   **Reality:**\n            *   Alice can derive `Kb`.\n            *   Bob *cannot* derive `Ka`.\n            *   **Simon can derive and access *both* `Ka` and `Kb`.**\n        *   **Conclusion:** This property is false. Simon has full access to both keys.\n\n    *   **Property:** \"The communication between Alice and Bob is secured through Simon using public key encryption, which ensures confidentiality and integrity.\"\n        *   **Reality:**\n            *   **Confidentiality:** Messages sent to Simon (`{X}pk(S)`) are confidential against eavesdroppers. The message `S -> A: {Kb}Ka` is confidential against eavesdroppers. So, confidentiality *of the transmissions* seems okay for an attacker *not* Simon.\n            *   **Integrity/Authentication:**\n                *   Public key encryption *alone* (without digital signatures) does not guarantee integrity or sender authentication. Alice receives `{Kb}Ka` from Simon; she implicitly trusts Simon to deliver Bob's *actual* `Kb`. Bob receives a \"notification\" from Simon; he implicitly trusts Simon that it's genuinely from Alice. There's no direct cryptographic link or authentication *between Alice and Bob*. Simon is the central point of trust and authentication.\n                *   More critically, as noted, there is no \"communication between Alice and Bob\" that is secured by a *shared secret* because they don't have one established by this protocol. The protocol only facilitates a one-way transfer of `Kb` from Bob to Alice via Simon.\n\n#### Summary of Major Flaws:\n\n1.  **Failure to Establish a Shared Secret:** The most critical flaw is that Alice and Bob do not end up sharing the same secret key(s). Bob never receives `Ka`.\n2.  **Misleading Secrecy Claims:** The claims about who knows which key are incorrect. Simon knows both `Ka` and `Kb`, and Alice knows `Ka` (in addition to `Kb`).\n3.  **Simon as a Single Point of Failure:** Simon knows both keys. If Simon is compromised, the confidentiality of both `Ka` and `Kb` (and thus any communication using them) is lost.\n4.  **Incomplete Authentication/Integrity:** While confidentiality against eavesdroppers for individual messages is present, direct authentication between Alice and Bob is absent, relying entirely on Simon's trustworthiness. There are no explicit integrity checks (e.g., digital signatures) beyond the encryption itself.\n\n#### To make this a functional key exchange, substantial changes would be needed. For example, Simon would need to send `Ka` to Bob (encrypted with `Kb` for example) and `Kb` to Alice, so they both have both keys, or a derived shared key."]], "SPDL-1/unknown2.spdl": [[true, "// unknown2 Protocol Description\n// Participants: Initiator (I), Responder (R), Server (S)\n\n// Key Components:\n//   k_is: Shared symmetric key between I and S\n//   k_rs: Shared symmetric key between R and S\n//   kir: Session key (generated by S)\n// Nonces:\n//   ni: Nonce generated by I\n//   nr: Nonce generated by R\n\nprotocol unknown2 {\n\n  // Declare agents and key types\n  agent I, R, S;

While its name is somewhat whimsical, its design is based on solid cryptographic principles for its time.\n\nLet's break down the provided description and expand upon it, including crucial assumptions and detailed analysis.\n\n---\n\n## Wide Mouthed Frog Protocol Analysis\n\n### 1. Overview and Core Purpose\n\nThe Wide Mouthed Frog protocol aims to securely establish a symmetric session key (`Kir`) between an Initiator (I) and a Responder (R) with the help of a trusted Server (S). It ensures:\n*   **Secrecy:** `Kir` remains confidential.\n*   **Authentication:** I and R verify each other's (and the server's) authenticity.\n*   **Freshness:** Messages and the session key are recent, mitigating replay attacks.\n\nIt operates on the principle that both I and R already share a long-term symmetric secret key with the Server (S):\n*   `k(I,S)`: Shared symmetric key between Initiator and Server.\n*   `k(R,S)`: Shared symmetric key between Responder and Server.\n\n### 2. Participants\n\n*   **Initiator (I):** The party desiring to initiate a secure communication session. It generates the session key and its own timestamp.\n*   **Responder (R):** The party with whom the Initiator wishes to communicate. It generates its own timestamp as part of the response.\n*   **Server (S):** A trusted third party (Key Distribution Center - KDC) that facilitates the key exchange. It is privy to all session keys established through it.\n\n### 3. Detailed Message Flow (with assumed missing steps for completeness)\n\nThe provided description omits the explicit format for the messages sent *from the Server*. For the protocol to be secure and functional, these messages *must* also be encrypted using the pre-shared keys. The following detailed flow incorporates these necessary assumptions, which are standard for this protocol.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n*   **Trusted Server:** The server (S) is fully trusted by both I and R. A compromise of S would compromise the entire protocol.\n*   **Shared Symmetric Keys:** `k(I,S)` and `k(R,S)` are pre-distributed and known only to the respective parties and S.\n*   **Timestamps:** Timestamps (`Ti`, `Ts`) are used to provide freshness. Parties are assumed to have loosely synchronized clocks, or at least a mechanism to accept timestamps within a reasonable skew.\n\n---\n\n**Step 1: Initiator (I) to Server (S)**\n*   **Purpose:** I requests a session key for communication with R and provides its own freshness challenge.\n*   **I generates:**\n    *   `Kir`: A fresh, random session key.\n    *   `Ti`: A fresh timestamp.\n*   **Message:**\n    ```\n    I -> S: {I, Ti, R, Kir}k(I,S)\n    ```\n*   **Explanation:**\n    *   `I`: Initiator's identity. Included for S to verify that the sender matches the identity claimed *inside* the encrypted message, thus authenticating I to S.\n    *   `Ti`: Initiator's timestamp, proving the message is fresh from I's perspective.\n    *   `R`: Responder's identity, indicating I's desired communication partner.\n    *   `Kir`: The proposed session key I wants to use with R.\n    *   `k(I,S)`: Encrypted with the shared key between I and S, ensuring confidentiality and integrity from I to S, and authenticating I to S.\n\n---\n\n**Step 2: Server (S) to Responder (R)**\n*   **Purpose:** S, having decrypted I's request, securely forwards the necessary session information to R. This is a critical step often underspecified.\n*   **S processes:** Decrypts the message from I using `k(I,S)`, extracts `I`, `Ti`, `R`, `Kir`.\n*   **S generates:** No new data, just forwards relevant info.\n*   **Message (Assumed necessary format):**\n    ```\n    S -> R: {I, Kir, Ti}k(R,S)\n    ```\n*   **Explanation:**\n    *   `I`: Initiator's identity, so R knows who wants to communicate.\n    *   `Kir`: The proposed session key (as generated by I).\n    *   `Ti`: Initiator's timestamp, which R should check for freshness. This helps R determine if I's original request was fresh.\n    *   `k(R,S)`: Encrypted with the shared key between R and S, ensuring confidentiality and integrity from S to R, and authenticating S to R.\n    *   **Note:** The original description simply states \"Server... forwards the message to the responder (R) after decrypting it.\" Without encryption in this step, `Kir` would be sent in plaintext, compromising its secrecy. This assumed encrypted message is crucial for the protocol's security goals.\n\n---\n\n**Step 3: Responder (R) to Server (S)**\n*   **Purpose:** R acknowledges receipt of `Kir` and `Ti` from S, and sends its own freshness challenge to S.\n*   **R processes:** Decrypts the message from S using `k(R,S)`. R checks `Ti` against its current clock to ensure the message from S (and thus I's original request) is fresh. If `Ti` is too old, R rejects the message.\n*   **R generates:**\n    *   `Ts`: A fresh timestamp.\n*   **Message:**\n    ```\n    R -> S: {S, Ts, I, Kir}k(R,S)\n    ```\n*   **Explanation:**\n    *   `S`: Server's identity. Included for S to verify that R believes it's talking to S (similar to I's identity in step 1).\n    *   `Ts`: Responder's timestamp, proving the message is fresh from R's perspective.\n    *   `I`: Initiator's identity, to confirm R knows who the session is for.\n    *   `Kir`: The session key received from S, echoed back to confirm R processed it correctly.\n    *   `k(R,S)`: Encrypted with the shared key between R and S, ensuring confidentiality and integrity from R to S, and authenticating R to S.\n\n---\n\n**Step 4: Server (S) to Initiator (I)**\n*   **Purpose:** S forwards R's confirmation to I, allowing I to verify that R has received and accepted the session key.\n*   **S processes:** Decrypts the message from R using `k(R,S)`, extracts `S`, `Ts`, `I`, `Kir`. S checks `Kir` matches the `Kir` it received from I in Step 1.\n*   **S generates:** No new data.\n*   **Message (Assumed necessary format):**\n    ```\n    S -> I: {R, Kir, Ts}k(I,S)\n    ```\n*   **Explanation:**\n    *   `R`: Responder's identity, so I knows who responded.\n    *   `Kir`: The session key, confirming that R has accepted it.\n    *   `Ts`: Responder's timestamp. I should check `Ts` against its current clock to ensure R's response is fresh.\n    *   `k(I,S)`: Encrypted with the shared key between I and S, ensuring confidentiality and integrity from S to I, and authenticating S to I.\n    *   **I's Final Verification:** Upon receiving this, I decrypts it using `k(I,S)`. I then verifies that `Kir` matches the key it initially sent in Step 1. It also verifies that `Ts` is fresh. If all checks pass, I is confident that R has the correct `Kir` and has accepted it, and that R's message is fresh.\n\n---\n\n### 4. Claims Analysis\n\nThe claims are statements of security properties from the perspective of each participant.\n\n*   **Claim I1: The initiator (I) can claim that `Kir` is a secret.**\n    *   **Validity:** This holds true *if* the server (S) is trusted and `k(I,S)` and `k(R,S)` are secure. `Kir` is only transmitted encrypted with these keys. However, it's crucial to note that `Kir` is *known by the server*. So, it's a secret *between I and R*, but *not* from S.\n\n*   **Claim I2: The initiator also claims that `(Fresh, Kir)` holds true.**\n    *   **Validity:** I *generates* `Kir` and `Ti` freshly. When I receives `Ts` in Step 4, and `Ts` is fresh, I has a strong indication that R has processed the *current* `Kir`. So, from I's perspective, `Kir` is indeed fresh as it was just used in a fresh exchange.\n\n*   **Claim R1: The responder (R) can claim that `Kir` is a secret.**\n    *   **Validity:** Similar to I1, `Kir` is a secret between R and I, but *not* from S. S has full knowledge of `Kir`.\n\n*   **Claim R2: The responder claims non-synchronization (Nisynch).**\n    *   **Validity:** This claim typically refers to the fact that strict clock synchronization between I and R is not required. The use of separate timestamps (`Ti` from I, `Ts` from R), each checked locally for freshness (i.e., not being too old), allows for a reasonable clock skew. This claim is valid.\n\n*   **Claim R3: The responder asserts that `(Fresh, Kir)` holds true.**\n    *   **Validity:** R receives `Kir` along with `Ti` in Step 2. If R validates `Ti` as fresh (i.e., within its acceptable time window), then R accepts that the `Kir` it received is part of a fresh request initiated by I. So, this claim is valid based on R's local freshness check of `Ti`.\n\n### 5. Security Properties Achieved\n\n*   **Authentication:**\n    *   **I authenticates S:** By successfully decrypting S's message in Step 4 using `k(I,S)`.\n    *   **S authenticates I:** By successfully decrypting I's message in Step 1 using `k(I,S)`.\n    *   **R authenticates S:** By successfully decrypting S's message in Step 2 using `k(R,S)`.\n    *   **S authenticates R:** By successfully decrypting R's message in Step 3 using `k(R,S)`.\n    *   **I authenticates R:** Indirectly. I knows S received R's message with `Ts` and `Kir`, and S confirmed `Kir`. I's acceptance of `Ts` as fresh confirms R's participation.\n    *   **R authenticates I:** Indirectly. R knows S received I's message with `Ti` and `Kir`, and S forwarded it. R's acceptance of `Ti` as fresh confirms I's initiation.\n    *   **Note:** Direct end-to-end authentication between I and R is mediated by S. I and R trust S to accurately represent the other party.\n\n*   **Freshness:**\n    *   **Replay Attacks:** The inclusion of fresh timestamps (`Ti` and `Ts`) in each direction significantly mitigates replay attacks. If an attacker replays an old message, the timestamp check will fail, and the message will be rejected.\n    *   `Kir` freshness: `Kir` is generated by I. `Ti` and `Ts` ensure that the exchange is fresh.\n\n*   **Secrecy:**\n    *   The session key `Kir` is kept confidential from eavesdroppers because it is always transmitted inside encrypted messages.\n    *   **Crucial Limitation:** The server (S) *knows* `Kir`. This is a defining characteristic of this protocol family (often called a \"trusted third party\" protocol). If S is compromised, all session keys it helped establish are compromised. This makes it unsuitable for scenarios where I and R require a key *unknown to S*.\n\n### 6. Strengths\n\n*   **Simplicity:** Relatively straightforward message flow.\n*   **Efficiency:** Uses symmetric key cryptography, which is computationally faster than asymmetric methods.\n*   **Centralized Key Management:** Useful in environments where a trusted KDC is acceptable and simplifies key distribution.\n*   **Replay Protection:** Effective use of timestamps.\n\n### 7. Weaknesses and Limitations\n\n*   **Trusted Third Party (TTP) / Single Point of Failure:** The server (S) is a full TTP and a single point of failure. If S is compromised, all session keys managed by it are compromised, and impersonation attacks become possible.\n*   **Server Knows the Session Key:** This is the most significant limitation. The session key `Kir` is known to S, which means it's not truly end-to-end secret between I and R only.\n*   **Clock Synchronization:** Relies on reasonably synchronized clocks between I, R, and S for timestamp validation. Significant clock skew could lead to legitimate messages being rejected or old messages being accepted.\n*   **No Explicit Key Confirmation (between I and R):** While I and R can verify the freshness of the *exchange*, they don't explicitly prove to each other that they *both know the correct `Kir`* without S's mediation. There's no direct \"challenge-response\" *between I and R* using `Kir` within the protocol messages.\n*   **Vague Forwarding Steps:** As noted, the original description's lack of explicit encryption for S->R and S->I messages makes the protocol insecure as described. A secure implementation *must* include these encryptions.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe Wide Mouthed Frog protocol is a foundational example of a KDC-based key exchange. It provides good authentication and freshness properties within a trusted third-party model. However, its primary limitation\u2014the server's knowledge of the session key\u2014means it's not suitable for applications requiring perfect forward secrecy or strict end-to-end secrecy from the key distribution mechanism itself. It's often studied as a precursor to more complex protocols that address this TTP knowledge issue, such as those employing Diffie-Hellman key exchange."]], "SPDL-1/woo-lam.spdl": [[false, "The provided description of the \"Woo and Lam Mutual Authentication Protocol\" contains several significant inconsistencies, contradictions, and potential flaws that make the protocol, as presented, unworkable and not truly \"mutual authentication.\"\n\nHere's a detailed critique:\n\n### Major Inconsistencies and Contradictions\n\nThe most striking issues are the frequent mismatches between the textual description of who sends what to whom, and the provided `send_X`/`recv_X` notation.\n\n1.  **Step 2 (Response):**\n    *   **Description:** \"The responder (R) generates its own nonce (N2) and sends it back to I, along with its identity.\"\n    *   **Notation:** `recv_2(R, I, R, N2);`\n    *   **Contradiction:** `recv_2(R, I, ...)` means R *receives* a message *from I*. However, the description states R *sends* the message. This should logically be `send_2(R, I, R, N2);`.\n\n2.  **Step 3 (Session Key Request):**\n    *   **Description:** \"The initiator sends a message... to the server.\"\n    *   **Notation:** `send_3(I, R, {I, R, N1, N2}k(I, S));`\n    *   **Contradiction:** `send_3(I, R, ...)` indicates I sends to R. The description explicitly states I sends *to the server (S)*. This should logically be `send_3(I, S, {I, R, N1, N2}k(I, S));`.\n\n3.  **Step 4 (Ticket Generation):** This is the most problematic step.\n    *   **Description:** \"The server generates a session key (Kir) and sends a message to R, which includes the responder's identity, both nonces, and the session key, encrypted with `k(R, S)`.\"\n    *   **Notation:** `recv_6(R, I, {R, N1, N2, Kir}k(I, S), {N1, N2}Kir);`\n    *   **Multiple Contradictions/Flaws:**\n        *   `recv_6(R, I, ...)` means R *receives* from I. The description says the *Server (S) sends to R*. This is a fundamental error. It should be `send_4(S, R, ...)` if S sends directly to R, or more commonly `send_4(S, I, ...)` and then I forwards part of it to R.\n        *   The description says \"encrypted with `k(R, S)`\". The notation shows the first part encrypted with `k(I, S)`. This is a direct contradiction.\n        *   **Logical Flaw in Notation:** If S sends `{R, N1, N2, Kir}k(I, S)` to R, R *cannot decrypt* this message because it's encrypted with `k(I, S)` (I's key with S), which R does not possess. This means the protocol as written is unworkable.\n        *   **Typical Kerberos-like flow:** In such protocols, the server `S` typically sends *two* encrypted parts back to the initiator `I`:\n            1.  A part encrypted with `k(I, S)` for `I` to decrypt (containing `Kir`, `R`, `N2`, and the ticket for R).\n            2.  A \"ticket\" for `R`, encrypted with `k(R, S)`, which `I` then forwards to `R` (containing `Kir`, `I`, `N1`, etc.).\n            *   The current Step 4 notation seems to conflate these or misrepresent them. The second part ` {N1, N2}Kir` appears to be a challenge from S, but encrypted with `Kir` which R has just supposedly received. The first part is completely misdirected.\n\n4.  **Step 5 (Final Response):**\n    *   **Description:** \"The responder (R) sends the nonce N2 back to I, encrypted with the session key (Kir).\"\n    *   **Notation:** `send_7(I, R, {N2}Kir);`\n    *   **Contradiction:** `send_7(I, R, ...)` indicates I sends to R. The description states R *sends* to I. This should logically be `send_5(R, I, {N2}Kir);`. (Also, the step number `7` is arbitrary given the previous steps are 1, 2, 3, 6, which are inconsistent themselves).\n\n### Protocol Design Flaws\n\n1.  **Missing Mutual Authentication:**\n    *   The protocol description claims \"mutual authentication.\" However, in Step 5, only R sends `{N2}Kir` to I. This proves to I that R possesses `Kir` and is fresh (by using N2).\n    *   There is no corresponding step where I sends something like `{N1}Kir` to R. Without this, I does not prove its possession of `Kir` to R, meaning `R` has not authenticated `I`. Therefore, as described, this is **not a mutual authentication protocol**, but rather a unilateral authentication where R authenticates to I.\n\n2.  **Ambiguous \"Session Key\" `k(I, S)` / `k(R, S)`:**\n    *   The description refers to `k(I, S)` as a \"session key.\" In the context of server-assisted protocols like Kerberos, `k(I, S)` (and `k(R, S)`) are typically long-term, pre-shared symmetric keys between the principal and the server, not \"session keys.\" Session keys (`Kir`) are temporary keys established for a specific communication session between `I` and `R`. This terminology is confusing.\n\n3.  **Unclear \"Ticket\" Concept:**\n    *   The \"Key Concepts\" section mentions \"Ticket,\" but the protocol steps, particularly Step 4, do not clearly demonstrate the generation and use of a \"ticket\" in the conventional sense (i.e., an encrypted blob for a third party to decrypt and use). The ` {R, N1, N2, Kir}k(I, S)` part in Step 4 could be *intended* as a ticket for R, but it's incorrectly encrypted and sent to the wrong party (according to the notation).\n\n### Claims Analysis\n\nThe claims are generic and would hold *if* the protocol were correctly implemented and free of the logical flaws mentioned:\n\n*   **Claim I1/R1 (Established Secret Session Key):** This is the primary goal. If the protocol worked, this would be true.\n*   **Claim I2/R2 (No Synchronization Issue):** The use of nonces (N1, N2) helps prevent replay attacks and ensures freshness, contributing to synchronization.\n*   **Claim I3/R3 (Session Key Fresh and Not Compromised):** Nonces ensure freshness. \"Not compromised\" depends on the strength of the keys, cryptographic algorithms, and the trustworthiness of the server.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe provided description of the Woo and Lam Mutual Authentication Protocol is severely flawed due to:\n\n1.  **Numerous contradictions** between the textual description and the formal `send_X`/`recv_X` notation regarding message direction.\n2.  **Logical errors** in Step 4, where the server attempts to send a message encrypted with a key that the recipient (R) cannot possess, rendering that step unworkable.\n3.  **A critical missing step** for mutual authentication, as the initiator (I) never proves its knowledge of the session key (`Kir`) to the responder (R).\n4.  **Confusing terminology** regarding \"session keys\" for long-term secrets.\n\nAs described, the protocol is broken and does not achieve its stated goal of mutual authentication.

The Yahalom protocol is indeed a three-party key exchange protocol, often analyzed using BAN logic, but its message structure is precise.\n\nHere's a corrected and more accurate description of the Yahalom Protocol, which is likely what the prompt intended by \"Yahalom-BAN protocol\":\n\n---\n\n### Description of the Yahalom Protocol\n\n#### Overview\nThe Yahalom protocol is a three-party key distribution and authentication protocol designed for secure communication between an initiator (I) and a responder (R), facilitated by a trusted server (S). Its primary goal is to establish a shared, fresh session key between I and R, while ensuring mutual authentication and protection against replay attacks using nonces and encrypted messages. It builds on the principles of Kerberos but addresses some of its limitations, particularly regarding freshness checks.\n\n#### Participants\n1.  **Initiator (I)**: The party that wishes to establish a secure session with the responder.\n2.  **Responder (R)**: The party that responds to the initiator's request and participates in the key exchange.\n3.  **Server (S)**: A trusted third party (Key Distribution Center - KDC) that shares long-term secret keys with both I and R, and issues session keys.\n\n#### Assumptions\n*   **Shared Long-Term Keys**:\n    *   `Kis`: A secret long-term key shared only between Initiator (I) and Server (S).\n    *   `Krs`: A secret long-term key shared only between Responder (R) and Server (S).\n\n#### Roles and Messages (Protocol Flow)\n\nThe protocol consists of four messages:\n\n**1. Initiator (I) to Responder (R):**\n   *   **I -> R : `I, Ni`**\n   *   **Role of I**: Generates a fresh nonce `Ni` (Nonce for Initiator) to prove the freshness of its own message. Sends its identity `I` and `Ni` to `R`.\n   *   **Role of R**: Receives `I, Ni`. It knows `I` wishes to communicate.\n\n**2. Responder (R) to Server (S):**\n   *   **R -> S : `R, Nr, I, Ni`**\n   *   **Role of R**: Generates its own fresh nonce `Nr` (Nonce for Responder). Forwards `I` and `Ni` (received from I) along with its own identity `R` and `Nr` to the Server `S`. This tells `S` that `R` wants a key with `I` and verifies `I`'s identity from `Ni`.\n   *   **Role of S**: Receives `R, Nr, I, Ni`. `S` knows `R` wants a session key with `I`. `Ni` is included to link this request back to `I`'s initial message.\n\n**3. Server (S) to Initiator (I):**\n   *   **S -> I : `E_Kis(Kir, R, Nr), E_Krs(Kir, I)`**\n   *   **Role of S**:\n     *   Generates a fresh session key `Kir` for communication between `I` and `R`.\n     *   Constructs two encrypted blocks:\n       *   `E_Kis(Kir, R, Nr)`: Encrypts the session key `Kir`, Responder's identity `R`, and Responder's nonce `Nr` with `Kis` (I's shared key with `S`). This block is for `I`.\n       *   `E_Krs(Kir, I)`: Encrypts the session key `Kir` and Initiator's identity `I` with `Krs` (R's shared key with `S`). This block is commonly referred to as the **ticket** for `R`.\n     *   Sends both encrypted blocks to `I`.\n   *   **Role of I**:\n     *   Receives the message from `S`.\n     *   Decrypts `E_Kis(Kir, R, Nr)` using `Kis` to obtain `Kir`, `R`, and `Nr`.\n     *   `I` now possesses the session key `Kir`. `I` verifies the freshness of `Nr` (which `S` links to `I`'s `Ni`).\n     *   `I` still needs to forward the ticket to `R` and prove its knowledge of `Kir` to `R`.\n\n**4. Initiator (I) to Responder (R):**\n   *   **I -> R : `E_Krs(Kir, I), E_Kir(Nr)`**\n   *   **Role of I**:\n     *   Forwards the \"ticket\" `E_Krs(Kir, I)` to `R`. `R` needs this to decrypt `Kir`.\n     *   Encrypts `Nr` (received in Msg 3) with the newly established session key `Kir` and sends it to `R`. This serves as a freshness proof and a confirmation to `R` that `I` has successfully decrypted the key and is alive.\n   *   **Role of R**:\n     *   Receives the message from `I`.\n     *   Decrypts `E_Krs(Kir, I)` using `Krs` to obtain `Kir` and `I`. `R` now possesses the session key `Kir`.\n     *   Decrypts `E_Kir(Nr)` using the newly obtained `Kir`.\n     *   Compares the decrypted `Nr` with its own `Nr` (generated in Msg 2). If they match, `R` is assured that `I` is alive, has the correct session key, and that the entire exchange is fresh.\n\n#### Security Claims\n\nUpon successful completion of the protocol:\n\n*   **Confidentiality**: The session key `Kir` is known only to `I`, `R`, and `S`.\n*   **Mutual Authentication**: `I` and `R` mutually authenticate each other through the exchange of nonces and the use of the session key.\n*   **Key Freshness**: Both `I` and `R` are assured that `Kir` is fresh, largely due to the nonces `Ni` and `Nr` which ensure the timeliness of the messages and the session key itself.\n*   **Replay Protection**: The use of fresh nonces prevents an adversary from replaying old messages to establish a session with a compromised key.\n*   **Source Authentication**: Both parties can verify that the messages originated from the claimed sender.\n\n#### Conclusion\nThe Yahalom protocol provides a robust mechanism for secure key exchange and mutual authentication. Its reliance on fresh nonces and the trusted third party (Server) ensures that the communication remains confidential, integrity-protected, and resilient against various attacks, making it suitable for establishing secure channels between participants in a network."]], "SPDL-1/yahalom.spdl": [[false, "The provided description of the Yahalom protocol has a good high-level overview and correctly identifies the participants, general variables, and overall security goals. However, there are significant inaccuracies and missing details in the *protocol steps* and the description of the `Ticket (T)` that fundamentally misrepresent how the Yahalom protocol operates.\n\nHere's a breakdown of the issues:\n\n### General Accuracy and Clarity:\n\n**Strengths:**\n*   Clear identification of Initiator (I), Responder (R), and Server (S).\n*   Correctly lists nonces (`Ni`, `Nr`) and session key (`Kir`) as variables.\n*   Correctly identifies security goals (mutual authentication, confidentiality, replay resistance).\n*   The first message `I -> R : (I, Ni)` is correct.\n\n**Weaknesses / Inaccuracies:**\n\n1.  **Session Key Generation (`Kir`):**\n    *   **Major Error:** The description incorrectly states that the responder \"creates a ticket `T`\" and sends the session key `Kir` to the server in **Message 2**. In the standard Yahalom protocol, the **Server (S)** is responsible for generating the shared session key `Kir`. The responder merely requests a key for `I` and `R`.\n\n2.  **Ticket (`T`) Handling and Contents:**\n    *   **Inconsistent:** The description says the responder \"creates a ticket `T`\" in Message 2's description, but then the server \"sends back a response containing... a ticket `T`\" in Message 3. This is contradictory. The server typically *creates* the ticket (or at least the encrypted part for the responder to forward).\n    *   **Missing Information:** The *contents* of the ticket `T` are never specified. This is crucial for understanding its purpose and how it facilitates authentication and key distribution. A typical Yahalom ticket sent from S to R is something like `{Kir, I}k(R,S)` (a key for I from S, encrypted for R) or part of a larger encrypted block.\n\n3.  **Message 2: `R -> S : (R, {I, Ni, Nr}k(R, S))`**\n    *   As noted, `Kir` should *not* be in this message. The responder is asking the server to *establish* a key, not providing one. This message should typically contain `R, I, Ni, Nr` (either plaintext `R, I` and encrypted `Ni, Nr` or just `R, I, Ni, Nr` with no additional encryption over the whole message, only `Ni` and `Nr` might be encrypted with `k(R,S)` if they are part of a request the server needs to decrypt). A common representation is `R, I, Ni, Nr` with the expectation that S knows how to process this request.\n\n4.  **Message 3: `S -> R : {R, Kir, Ni, Nr}k(I, S), T`**\n    *   **Encryption Key Confusion:** The text description says \"encrypted with the same shared key\" but Message 2 used `k(R, S)` while this message uses `k(I, S)`. These are *not* the same. `k(I, S)` implies this block is intended for `I`, but it's sent to `R`. This is typical of Yahalom (S sends a part for I *via* R).\n    *   **Structure:** The standard Yahalom Message 3 typically has two main encrypted parts: one for R and one for I, both containing the session key `Kir` and nonces to prove freshness and authentication.\n        *   A common form is `S -> R : {Kir, I, Ni}k(R,S), {Kir, R, Ni}k(I,S)`.\n        *   The description's `{R, Kir, Ni, Nr}k(I, S)` is problematic. `R` inside an `k(I,S)` block doesn't make sense as something I would need to process, especially if it's for `I`. The `Nr` from R is usually confirmed back to R in the first part, and `Ni` is sent to I in the second part.\n    *   **Ticket `T`:** Still no clear definition of `T`. If `T` is `{Kir, I}k(R,S)`, it should be explicit.\n\n5.  **Message 4: `R -> I : {I, Kir}k(R, S), {Nr}Kir`**\n    *   **First Block:** `{I, Kir}k(R, S)`: This looks like it's supposed to be the \"ticket\" (`T`) from Message 3 that R forwards to I. However, if it's encrypted with `k(R,S)`, then `I` cannot decrypt it (unless `k(R,S)` is public, which it isn't). This block should be the part from Message 3 that was encrypted with `k(I,S)` so that `I` can decrypt it (e.g., `{Kir, R, Ni}k(I,S)`). The description makes it seem like R is creating this block or decrypting/re-encrypting it, which is not how Yahalom works.\n    *   **Second Block:** `{Nr}Kir`: This part is correct. It's R's proof of possession of `Kir` and confirmation of its freshness using `Nr`, sent to I.\n\n6.  **Claims:**\n    *   \"Server (S): Claims that both nonces `Ni` and `Nr` are secret.\" While S knows the nonces and contributes to their secrecy from outsiders, the phrasing \"claims they are secret\" is less precise. S ensures their confidentiality for the participants and uses them for freshness. The primary secrecy claim usually relates to the session key `Kir` between I and R.\n\n### Revised/Standard Yahalom Protocol Representation (for comparison):\n\nTo illustrate the differences, here's a more standard representation:\n\n**Keys:**\n*   `K_is`: Shared long-term key between I and S.\n*   `K_rs`: Shared long-term key between R and S.\n\n**Protocol Steps (Standard Yahalom):**\n\n1.  **`I -> R : I, Ni`**\n    *   (I sends its ID and a nonce `Ni` to R)\n\n2.  **`R -> S : R, I, Ni, Nr`**\n    *   (R sends its ID, I's ID, Ni, and its own nonce `Nr` to S. R is requesting a session key from S for I and R. Note: no `Kir` here!)\n\n3.  **`S -> R : {K_ir, I, Ni}K_rs, {K_ir, R, Ni}K_is`**\n    *   (S generates `K_ir`.)\n    *   The first block `{{K_ir, I, Ni}K_rs}` is for R. R can decrypt it using `K_rs` to get `K_ir`, `I`, and `Ni`. `Ni` confirms to R that S knows `Ni` and is responding to *this* specific request.\n    *   The second block `{{K_ir, R, Ni}K_is}` is the \"ticket\" for I, encrypted with I's shared key `K_is`. S sends it *via* R.\n\n4.  **`R -> I : {K_ir, R, Ni}K_is, {Nr}K_ir`**\n    *   (R forwards the \"ticket\" to I. I decrypts it using `K_is` to get `K_ir`, `R`, and `Ni`. This authenticates R to I, and `Ni` confirms freshness.)\n    *   R also sends `{Nr}K_ir`. I decrypts this using `K_ir` (which I just obtained). This authenticates R (by demonstrating knowledge of `K_ir`) and confirms freshness (by reflecting `Nr`).\n\n### Conclusion on the Provided Description:\n\nThe description provides a high-level understanding but contains critical errors regarding the generation and distribution of the session key (`Kir`) and the precise structure and purpose of the encrypted messages, particularly the ticket. These inaccuracies would lead to a misunderstanding of how Yahalom achieves its security goals. It would be beneficial to revise the protocol steps to accurately reflect the server's role in key generation and the specific contents and encryption of each message, especially the ticket."]]}
