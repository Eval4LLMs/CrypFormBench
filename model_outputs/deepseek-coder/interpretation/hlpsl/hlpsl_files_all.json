Server Response Phase:\n   - Bob receives Alice's message and responds with:\n     * Nb: Server nonce\n     * Sid: Same session ID\n     * Pa: Echoed client parameters\n     * {B.Kb}_(inv(Ks)): Server's certificate (signed by CA)\n\n3.

Secrecy of `sec_1` (the shared secret `N`)\n2. Secrecy of `sec_2` (though not explicitly used in the protocol)\n\n**Intruder Knowledge**:\n- The intruder initially knows the identities `a`, `b`, and the generator `f`\n\n**Session Composition**:\n- The protocol runs in a session where `role_A` and `role_B` communicate through channels\n\n**Notes**:\n- The protocol combines Diffie-Hellman key exchange with subsequent secret transmission\n- The shared Diffie-Hellman key (g^XY mod p) is used to encrypt the secret `N`\n- The protocol assumes perfect cryptography (no weaknesses in the encryption)\n\nThis description contains all the necessary information to reconstruct the original HLPSL file while making the protocol's operation clear.

Normal access request\n2. Exceptional access request\n\nParticipants:\n- Badge reader (B): Initiates the protocol by sending access requests\n- Server (S): Validates access requests and responds\n- Intruder (i): Potential malicious actor in the environment\n\nProtocol Flow:\n1. Initialization:\n   - Both badge reader and server start in State 0\n\n2. Access Request Phase:\n   - Badge reader receives 'start' signal (State 0 \u2192 State 1)\n   - Badge reader sends encrypted message: {IdEmploye.IdBadgeuse}_PKs\n     - IdEmploye: Employee identification\n     - IdBadgeuse: Badge reader identification\n     - Encrypted with server's public key (PKs)\n   - This information is marked as secret between {B,S}\n\n3. Server Validation Phase:\n   - Server receives and decrypts the message (State 0 \u2192 State 1)\n   - Server responds with {ok}_PKb (encrypted with badge reader's public key)\n\n4. Acknowledgment Phase:\n   - Badge reader receives server's response (State 1 \u2192 State 2)\n   - Badge reader sends acknowledgment: {ok}_PKs (encrypted with server's public key)\n\nSecurity Features:\n- Asymmetric encryption using public keys (PKb, PKs)\n- Secrecy protection for employee ID (idemploye)\n- Protection against man-in-the-middle through mutual authentication\n\nEnvironment Setup:\n- Includes two sessions:\n  1. Legitimate session between badge reader (b) and server (s)\n  2. Potential attack session between badge reader (b) and intruder (i)\n- Intruder knowledge includes public keys and its own private key\n\nSecurity Goal:\n- Maintain secrecy of the employee identification (idemploye)\n\nThis description captures all essential elements needed to reconstruct the HLPSL file, including:\n- Role definitions (badgeuse, serveur)\n- State transitions\n- Message formats and encryption\n- Environment configuration\n- Security goals\n\nThe protocol appears to be a simple access control mechanism with basic authentication through public key cryptography, focusing primarily on protecting the confidentiality of employee identification during the access request process."]]}, "HLPSL-1/EKE.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: EKE: Encrypted Key Exchange\n%% VARIANT: basic\n%% PURPOSE: Encrypted key exchange\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\url{http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/bellovin92encrypted.html}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%%   \\item Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n%%   \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%% A -> B : {Ea}_Kab        |    Key exchange part\n%% B -> A : {{K}_Ea}_Kab    |\n%% A -> B : {Ca}_K          |\n%% B -> A : {Ca,Cb}_K       |    Challenge/Response\n%% A -> B : {Cb}_K          |    Authentication part\n%% \\end{verbatim}\n%%\n%% LIMITATIONS: None\n%%\n%% PROBLEMS: 3\n%%\n%% CLASSIFICATION: G2 G12\n%%\n%% ATTACKS: \n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%% i -> (a,3): start\n%% (a,3) -> i: {Ea(1)}_kab\n%% i -> (a,6): {Ea(1)}_kab\n%% (a,6) -> i: {{K(2)}_Ea(1)}_kab \n%% i -> (a,3): {{K(2)}_Ea(1)}_kab\n%% (a,3) -> i: {Na(3)}_K(2) witness(a,b,na,Na(3))\n%% i -> (a,6): {Na(3)}_K(2)\n%% (a,6) -> i: {Na(3),Nb(4)}_K(2) witness(a,b,nb,Nb(4))\n%% i -> (a,3): {Na(3),Nb(4)}_K(2)\n%% (a,3) -> i: {Nb(4)}_K(2)  request(a,b,nb,Nb(4))\n%% \\end{verbatim}\n%%\n%% Parallel session attack, man-in-the-middle\n%% between A as initiator and A as responder, attacker\n%% masquerades as B, but no secret nonces are exposed.\n%%\n%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%HLPSL:\n\n/* \n * Role: eke_Init\n * Description: Initiator role in the Encrypted Key Exchange protocol\n * Parameters:\n *   A, B: agents (participants in the protocol)\n *   Kab: symmetric key shared between A and B\n *   Snd, Rcv: communication channels\n */\nrole eke_Init (A,B: agent,\n               Kab: symmetric_key,\n               Snd,Rcv: channel(dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n\n  local State   : nat,        /* Current state of the protocol */\n        Ea      : public_key, /* Ephemeral public key generated by A */\n        Na,Nb,K : text        /* Nonces and session key */\n\n  const sec_k1 : protocol_id  /* Protocol identifier for secrecy goals */\n\n  init  State := 0  /* Initial state */\n\n  transition\n\n   /* Transition 1: Start of protocol, generate ephemeral key */\n   1.

It provides both key exchange and mutual authentication.\n\nProtocol Flow:\n1. Key Exchange Phase:\n   - A \u2192 B: {Ea}_Kab (A sends its ephemeral public key Ea encrypted with the shared key Kab)\n   - B \u2192 A: {{K}_Ea}_Kab (B generates session key K, encrypts it with Ea, then encrypts the result with Kab)\n\n2. Authentication Phase:\n   - A \u2192 B: {Na}_K (A sends a fresh nonce Na encrypted with the new session key K)\n   - B \u2192 A: {Na,Nb}_K (B responds with both nonces encrypted with K)\n   - A \u2192 B: {Nb}_K (A confirms receipt of B's nonce)\n\nRoles:\n1. Initiator (A):\n   - Generates ephemeral public key Ea\n   - Initiates the protocol with encrypted Ea\n   - Verifies the session key K from B\n   - Generates challenge Na\n   - Verifies B's response containing Nb\n\n2. Responder (B):\n   - Receives and decrypts A's ephemeral key\n   - Generates session key K and sends it doubly encrypted\n   - Responds to A's challenge Na with fresh nonce Nb\n   - Verifies A's confirmation of Nb\n\nSecurity Properties:\n1. Confidentiality:\n   - sec_k1, sec_k2: Secrecy of the established session key K\n2. Authentication:\n   - Authentication of B to A on nonce Nb\n   - Authentication of A to B on nonce Na\n\nKnown Attacks:\nThe protocol is vulnerable to a parallel session attack where an attacker can:\n1. Intercept messages between two sessions of A (one as initiator, one as responder)\n2. Act as a man-in-the-middle without exposing secret nonces\n3. Complete both sessions successfully while masquerading as B\n\nImplementation Notes:\n- Uses symmetric encryption ({ }_Kab) for initial key exchange\n- Uses public-key encryption ({ }_Ea) for session key transport\n- Uses symmetric encryption with session key ({ }_K) for authentication\n- Nonces (Na, Nb) provide freshness and mutual authentication\n\nThis description contains all the necessary information to reconstruct the HLPSL specification, including:\n- Protocol message flow\n- Role definitions and transitions\n- Security goals\n- Cryptographic operations\n- Attack scenarios\n\nThe protocol follows the classic EKE pattern described by Bellovin and Merritt, providing both key establishment and entity authentication through challenge-response exchanges."]]}, "HLPSL-1/h.530.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: H.530: Symmetric security procedures for H.323 mobility in H.510\n%% VARIANT: Original version\n%% PURPOSE: Establish an authenticated (Diffie-Hellman) shared-key\n%% between a mobile terminal (MT) and a visited gate-keeper (VGK), who do not\n%% know each other in advance, but who have a \"mutual friend\", an \n%% authentication facility (AuF) in the home domain of MT. \n%%\n%% REFERENCE: \\url{http://www.itu.int/rec/recommendation.asp?type=folders&lang=e&parent=T-REC-H.530} \\\\\n%% (original version without \"corrigendum\")\n%% MODELER: Sebastian M\\\"odersheim, ETH Z\\\"urich, 2004\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%%  Macros\n%%  M1 = MT,VGK,NIL,CH1,exp(G,X)\n%%  M2 = M1,F(ZZ,M1),VGK,exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y)\n%%  M3 = VGK,MT,F(ZZ,VGK),F(ZZ,exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y))\n%%  M4 = VGK,MT,CH1,CH2,exp(G,Y),F(ZZ,exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y)),F(ZZ,VGK)\n%%  M5 = MT,VGK,CH2,CH3\n%%  M6 = VGK,MT,CH3,CH4\n%%-------------------------------------------------------------------\n%%  1.

Each of the hops shares a symmetric key with its\n%% neighbouring hops and forwards messages in the chain decrypting and\n%% re-encrypting them accordingly. All the hops and AuF have to be\n%% honest, since if one of them modifies messages or inserts new ones,\n%% the protocol trivially cannot provide authentication. In our\n%% formalisation we have modelled no intermediate hops (so VGK and AuF\n%% directly share a key) and a simple reduction proof shows that all\n%% attacks possible in a setting with an arbitrary number of intermediate\n%% hops can be simulated in our model with no intermediate hops. Note,\n%% however, that it is not possible to take this idea further and \"merge\" an\n%% honest VGK with AuF, as demonstrated by the attacks we have discovered\n%% where the intruder eavesdrops and replays messages (that he cannot\n%% decrypt) exchanged between VGK and AuF.\n%%\n%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \t\n%%  HLPSL:\n\n/* \n * Role: mobileTerminal\n * Description: Represents the Mobile Terminal (MT) in the protocol\n * Parameters:\n *   MT, VGK, AuF: Agents representing Mobile Terminal, Visited Gate Keeper, and Authentication Facility\n *   SND, RCV: Communication channels\n *   F: Hash function\n *   ZZ: Symmetric key shared between MT and AuF\n *   NIL, G: Constants used in the protocol\n */\nrole mobileTerminal (\n    MT,VGK,AuF : agent,\n    SND,RCV    : channel(dy),\n    F          : hash_func,\n    ZZ\t       : symmetric_key,\n    NIL,G      : text)\nplayed_by MT def=\n\n  local\n    State       : nat,        /* Current state of the protocol execution */\n    X,CH1,CH3   : text,       /* Diffie-Hellman exponent and challenge values */\n    CH2,CH4     : text,       /* Challenge values received from VGK */\n    GY,Key      : message     /* Received DH public value and computed session key */\n\n  const sec_m_Key : protocol_id  /* Identifier for the session key secrecy property */\n    \n  init  State := 0  /* Initial state */\n\n  transition\n\n  /* Transition 1: Initiate protocol by sending first message */\n  1.

The \n%%   attack works by first observing a session between honest agents and\n%%   then replaying messages from this session to $VGK$, posing both as\n%%   $MT$ and $AuF$. Use option sessco to find this attack with OFMC.\n%%   Another attack recently discovered with OFMC is based on the fact that\n%%   $VGK$ cannot distinguish messages (2) and (3). \n%%\n%% NOTES:\n%%\n%% The fixed version, also included in this library, is not vulnerable to\n%% the attacks. \n%%\n%% In the original protocol description there is a chain of intermediate\n%% hops between VGK and AuF, where the length of this chain depends on\n%% the concrete setting. Each of the hops shares a symmetric key with its\n%% neighbouring hops and forwards messages in the chain decrypting and\n%% re-encrypting them accordingly. All the hops and AuF have to be\n%% honest, since if one of them modifies messages or inserts new ones,\n%% the protocol trivially cannot provide authentication. In our\n%% formalisation we have modelled no intermediate hops (so VGK and AuF\n%% directly share a key) and a simple reduction proof shows that all\n%% attacks possible in a setting with an arbitrary number of intermediate\n%% hops can be simulated in our model with no intermediate hops. Note,\n%% however, that it is not possible to take this idea further and \"merge\" an\n%% honest VGK with AuF, as demonstrated by the attacks we have discovered\n%% where the intruder eavesdrops and replays messages (that he cannot\n%% decrypt) exchanged between VGK and AuF.\n%%\n%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \t\n%%  HLPSL:\n\n/* \n * Role: mobileTerminal\n * Description: Represents the Mobile Terminal (MT) in the protocol\n * Parameters:\n *   MT, VGK, AuF: Agents representing Mobile Terminal, Visited Gate Keeper, and Authentication Facility\n *   SND, RCV: Communication channels\n *   F: Hash function\n *   ZZ: Symmetric key shared between MT and AuF\n *   NIL, G: Constants used in the protocol\n */\nrole mobileTerminal (\n    MT,VGK,AuF : agent,\n    SND,RCV    : channel(dy),\n    F          : hash_func,\n    ZZ\t       : symmetric_key,\n    NIL,G      : text)\nplayed_by MT def=\n\n  local\n    State       : nat,        /* Current state of the protocol execution */\n    X,CH1,CH3   : text,       /* Diffie-Hellman exponent and challenge values */\n    CH2,CH4     : text,       /* Challenge values received from VGK */\n    GY,Key      : message     /* Received DH public value and computed session key */\n\n  const sec_m_Key : protocol_id  /* Identifier for the session key secrecy property */\n    \n  init  State := 0  /* Initial state */\n\n  transition\n\n  /* Transition 1: Initiate protocol by sending first message */\n  1.

They rely on a trusted third party, an Authentication Facility (AuF), in the MT's home domain.\n\n**Participants**:\n1. **Mobile Terminal (MT)**: The mobile device seeking authentication.\n2. **Visited Gate-Keeper (VGK)**: The local gatekeeper in the visited domain.\n3. **Authentication Facility (AuF)**: The trusted third party in the MT's home domain that facilitates authentication.\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- MT and AuF share a symmetric key `ZZ`.\n- VGK and AuF share a symmetric key `ZZ_VA`.\n- The intruder may know some symmetric keys (`zz_i_auf`) but not `ZZ` or `ZZ_VA`.\n\n**Protocol Steps**:\n\n1. **MT \u2192 VGK**:  \n   - MT sends: `MT, VGK, NIL, CH1, exp(G, X), F(ZZ, MT.VGK.NIL.CH1.exp(G,X))`  \n   - This includes a nonce `CH1`, a Diffie-Hellman public value `exp(G, X)`, and a MAC using `ZZ`.\n\n2. **VGK \u2192 AuF**:  \n   - VGK forwards the message from MT and adds its own DH public value `exp(G, Y)`:  \n     `MT.VGK.NIL.CH1.exp(G,X).F(ZZ, MT.VGK.NIL.CH1.exp(G,X)).VGK.(exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y))`  \n   - VGK also includes a MAC using `ZZ_VA`.\n\n3. **AuF \u2192 VGK**:  \n   - AuF verifies the MACs and replies with:  \n     `VGK, MT, F(ZZ, VGK), F(ZZ, exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y))`  \n   - This is MAC'd with `ZZ_VA`.\n\n4. **VGK \u2192 MT**:  \n   - VGK sends:  \n     `VGK, MT, CH1, CH2, exp(G,Y), F(ZZ, exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y)), F(ZZ, VGK)`  \n   - Includes a new nonce `CH2` and a MAC using the derived key `exp(exp(G,X), Y)`.\n\n5. **MT \u2192 VGK**:  \n   - MT verifies the MACs and replies with:  \n     `MT, VGK, CH2, CH3, F(Key, MT.VGK.CH2.CH3)`  \n   - `Key = exp(exp(G,Y), X)` (same as VGK's `Key` due to DH property).\n\n6. **VGK \u2192 MT**:  \n   - VGK confirms with:  \n     `VGK, MT, CH3, CH4, F(Key, VGK.MT.CH3.CH4)`  \n\n**Security Goals**:\n1. **Authentication**:  \n   - `authentication_on key`: MT and VGK authenticate each other via the derived key.\n   - `authentication_on key1`: Additional authentication step.\n\n2. **Secrecy**:  \n   - `secrecy_of sec_m_Key, sec_v_Key`: The derived key `Key` is kept secret from the intruder.\n\n**Vulnerabilities**:\n1. **Replay Attack**:  \n   - The protocol is vulnerable to replay attacks because AuF's reply does not contain enough information for VGK to verify freshness. An intruder can replay old messages to impersonate MT or AuF.\n\n2. **Message Distinction**:  \n   - VGK cannot distinguish between messages (2) and (3), which may lead to confusion and potential attacks.\n\n**Notes**:\n- The protocol assumes all intermediate hops (if any) between VGK and AuF are honest. In the model, these are omitted for simplicity.\n- A fixed version of the protocol exists that addresses these vulnerabilities.\n\n**HLPSL Features**:\n- Uses Diffie-Hellman (`exp(G, X)`) for key derivation.\n- Employs symmetric-key MACs (`F(ZZ, ...)`) for authentication.\n- Models intruder knowledge explicitly (`zz_i_auf`).\n\nThis description captures the protocol's structure, security goals, and known issues, enabling recreation of the HLPSL file for Avispa analysis."]]}, "HLPSL-1/IKEv2-DS.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: IKEv2: Internet Key Exchange, version 2\n%% VARIANT: authentication based on digital signatures\n%% PURPOSE:\n%% IKE is designed to perform mutual authentication and key\n%% exchange prior to setting up an IPsec connection.\n%%\n%% IKEv2 exists in several variants, the defining difference\n%% being the authentication method used.  \n%%\n%% This variant, which we call IKEv2-DS, uses digital signatures.\n%%\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\cite{ipsec-ikev2}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%% \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\item Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% IKEv2-DS proceeds in two so-called exchanges.

The protocol establishes mutual authentication and key exchange prior to setting up an IPsec connection.\n\n## Protocol Phases\nThe protocol operates in two exchanges:\n\n### 1. IKE_SA_INIT Exchange\nPurpose: Establishes initial security parameters and performs Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\nMessage Flow:\n1. Initiator (A) \u2192 Responder (B): \n   - SAa1 (security association offer)\n   - KEa = g^DHX (Diffie-Hellman half-key)\n   - Na (nonce)\n\n2. Responder (B) \u2192 Initiator (A):\n   - SAb1 (security association response, same as SAa1 in model)\n   - KEb = g^DHY (Diffie-Hellman half-key)\n   - Nb (nonce)\n\n### 2. IKE_AUTH Exchange\nPurpose: Authenticates previous messages and establishes first child security association.\n\nMessage Flow:\n3. Initiator (A) \u2192 Responder (B):\n   - Encrypted with session key K:\n     * Identity A\n     * AUTHa = {SAa1, g^DHX, Na, Nb} signed with A's private key\n     * SAa2 (child security association offer)\n\n4. Responder (B) \u2192 Initiator (A):\n   - Encrypted with session key K:\n     * Identity B\n     * AUTHb = {SAb1, g^DHY, Na, Nb} signed with B's private key\n     * SAb2 (child security association response)\n\n## Key Derivation\nThe session key K is derived as:\nK = H(Na || Nb || SA1 || g^(DHX*DHY))\n\n## Roles Specification\n\n### Alice (Initiator) Role\n1. Initial State (0):\n   - Receives start signal\n   - Generates new SA1, DHX, and Ni\n   - Sends first message\n\n2. State 2:\n   - Receives response from Bob\n   - Verifies SA1 matches\n   - Computes session key\n   - Sends authenticated message with digital signature\n\n3. State 4:\n   - Receives final message from Bob\n   - Verifies authentication\n   - Establishes session key secrecy\n\n### Bob (Responder) Role\n1. Initial State (1):\n   - Receives initiator's first message\n   - Generates new DHY and Nr\n   - Sends response\n   - Computes session key\n\n2. State 3:\n   - Receives authenticated message from Alice\n   - Verifies signature\n   - Sends final authenticated message\n   - Establishes session key secrecy\n\n## Security Goals\n1. Secrecy of session keys (sec_a_SK, sec_b_SK)\n2. Mutual authentication:\n   - Alice authenticates Bob on sk1\n   - Bob authenticates Alice on sk2\n\n## Environment Setup\n- Includes three parallel sessions:\n  1. Honest session between Alice and Bob\n  2. Session between Alice and Intruder\n  3. Session between Intruder and Bob\n- Intruder knowledge includes all public keys and its own private key\n\n## Limitations Modeled\n1. Simplified cryptographic negotiation (single offer/accept)\n2. No identity hiding\n3. No certificate exchange\n4. No traffic selectors\n\n## Attack Consideration\nThe model includes a known man-in-the-middle attack where the intruder can relay messages between different sessions, though with limited practical impact as the intruder doesn't learn the actual session key.\n\nThis description provides all necessary information to reconstruct the HLPSL specification while maintaining the protocol's security properties and analysis capabilities."]]}, "HLPSL-1/NSPK_2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%Alice - Bob Protocol\n%\n% Protocol Description:\n%   1.

The protocol establishes a session key Kab between Alice and Bob with mutual authentication.\n\n### Protocol Roles\n\n1. **Alice (A)**\n   - Shares a long-term symmetric key Kas with the Server\n   - Initiates the protocol by sending a nonce to Bob\n   - Verifies Bob's identity through the Server\n   - Establishes a session key Kab with Bob\n\n2. **Bob (B)**\n   - Shares a long-term symmetric key Kbs with the Server\n   - Responds to Alice's initiation with his own nonce\n   - Relies on the Server to authenticate Alice\n   - Establishes a session key Kab with Alice\n\n3. **Server (S)**\n   - Shares Kas with Alice and Kbs with Bob\n   - Acts as a trusted third party\n   - Generates and distributes the session key Kab\n   - Verifies the authenticity of both parties\n\n### Protocol Steps\n\n1. **Initialization Phase**\n   - Alice generates nonce Na and sends it to Bob: A.Na\n\n2. **Response Phase**\n   - Bob generates nonce Nb and responds: B.Nb\n\n3. **Authentication Request**\n   - Alice sends encrypted message to Bob: {A.B.Na.Nb}_Kas\n   - Bob forwards this to Server along with his own encrypted message: {A.B.Na.Nb}_Kbs\n\n4. **Key Distribution**\n   - Server verifies both messages and generates session key Kab\n   - Server sends to Alice: {B.Na.Nb.Kab}_Kas\n   - Server sends to Bob: {A.Na.Nb.Kab}_Kbs\n\n5. **Confirmation Phase**\n   - Alice and Bob exchange confirmation messages encrypted with Kab to verify the session key\n\n### Security Properties\n- **Mutual Authentication**: Both Alice and Bob are authenticated to each other through the Server\n- **Session Key Establishment**: A fresh session key Kab is established between Alice and Bob\n- **Secrecy**: The session key Kab remains secret from eavesdroppers\n- **Freshness**: Nonces Na and Nb ensure the session key is fresh\n\n### Intruder Knowledge\nThe intruder (i) initially knows:\n- All agent identities (a, b, s, i)\n- Can intercept and modify messages in the network\n\n### Verification Goals\nThe protocol aims to achieve authentication on the session key Kab (kab_id).\n\nThis description provides all the necessary information to reconstruct the HLPSL specification while maintaining the protocol's security properties and message flows.

Mutual authentication between Alice and Bob using a shared secret (S).\n2. Verification of message origin (Bob authenticates to Alice using the shared secret).\n\n**Assumptions**:\n- Alice and Bob share a secret text `S` (kept confidential between them).\n- The intruder knows the identities of Alice and Bob but not the shared secret `S`.\n\n### Protocol Steps\n\n#### Role A (Alice):\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Starts in state 0.\n   - Upon receiving a `start` signal, Alice:\n     - Generates a fresh nonce `Na` (using `new()`).\n     - Sends `Na` to Bob.\n     - Transitions to state 1.\n\n2. **Authentication**:\n   - In state 1, Alice waits to receive a message from Bob.\n   - The expected message is `xor(Na, S)` (i.e., the nonce `Na` XORed with the shared secret `S`).\n   - If Alice receives the correct XORed value, she:\n     - Transitions to state 2.\n     - Records an authentication request (`request(A, B, auth_1, Na)`) to verify that Bob is the originator of the nonce.\n\n#### Role B (Bob):\n1. **Initialization**:\n   - Starts in state 0.\n   - Waits to receive a nonce `Na'` from Alice.\n\n2. **Response**:\n   - Upon receiving `Na'`, Bob:\n     - Computes `xor(Na', S)` (XOR of the received nonce with the shared secret `S`).\n     - Sends this value back to Alice.\n     - Transitions to state 1.\n   - Records a `witness(B, A, auth_1, Na')` to assert that Bob is the originator of the nonce.\n\n### Security Goals\n1. **Secrecy**:\n   - `sec_1`: The shared secret `S` must remain confidential (known only to Alice and Bob).\n   - `sec_2`: (Not explicitly used in the protocol, but included in the goals.)\n\n2. **Authentication**:\n   - `auth_1`: Alice must verify that Bob is the originator of the nonce (weak authentication).\n\n### Session Composition\n- The protocol is composed of two parallel sessions between Alice and Bob using the same shared secret `s1`.\n- The environment includes Alice, Bob, and the intruder (who knows their identities but not `s1`).\n\n### Intruder Capabilities\n- The intruder can intercept, modify, and replay messages (DY model).\n- The intruder does not initially know the shared secret `S`.\n\n### Notes\n- The protocol uses XOR-based authentication, which may be vulnerable if the shared secret is reused or if the XOR operation is not implemented securely.\n- The two parallel sessions in the environment suggest a check for replay attacks (though the protocol does not explicitly prevent them).\n\n### HLPSL File Generation\nThis description can be used to regenerate the HLPSL file, as it captures:\n1. The roles of Alice and Bob.\n2. The message exchanges and transitions.\n3. The security goals (secrecy and authentication).\n4. The intruder model and session composition.\n\nWould you like me to generate the HLPSL file from this description?"]]}, "HLPSL-1/Anonymous_E2E_authenticated_key_exchange_scheme.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "/*\nProtocol description:\nThis protocol appears to be a mutual authentication and key exchange protocol\nbetween a User (U), Server (S), and Foreign server (F).

Environment:\n- Models three legitimate sessions and three intruder-involved sessions\n- Intruder has knowledge of public keys and inverse of its own private key\n- Follows Dolev-Yao attacker model\n\nThis protocol implements a three-party authentication scheme with:\n1. Secure registration using symmetric encryption\n2. Mutual authentication using public-key cryptography\n3. Key exchange using elliptic curve operations (Mul function)\n4. Protection against replay attacks through nonces (Nfp, Nfp1)\n5.

Client Initiation:\n   - A \u2192 B: A (client identifier)\n\n2. Server Challenge:\n   - B \u2192 A: Nb (server-generated nonce)\n\n3. Client Response:\n   - A \u2192 B: Na, H(Kab, (Na, Nb, A))\n     - Where Na is client-generated nonce\n     - H is a hash function\n     - The hash includes both nonces and client identifier\n\n4. Server Verification:\n   - B \u2192 A: H(Kab, Na)\n\nSecurity Properties:\n1. Secrecy:\n   - The shared secret Kab must remain confidential (sec_kab1, sec_kab2)\n   \n2. Authentication:\n   - Mutual authentication through nonce verification:\n     - Client authenticates server via nb (Nb)\n     - Server authenticates client via na (Na)\n\n3. Goals:\n   - G1, G2: Authentication properties\n   - G12: Secrecy of the shared key\n\nRoles:\n1. chap_Init (Client):\n   - Generates client nonce Na\n   - Verifies server's response using H(Kab, Na)\n   - Maintains state (0-3) to track protocol progress\n   - Uses witness/request for authentication proofs\n\n2. chap_Resp (Server):\n   - Generates server nonce Nb\n   - Verifies client's response using H(Kab, (Na, Nb, A))\n   - Maintains state (0-2) to track protocol progress\n   - Uses witness/request for authentication proofs\n\nEnvironment:\n- Models three agents: client (a), server (b), and intruder (i)\n- Includes three sessions:\n  1. Legitimate a-b session with correct key kab\n  2. a-i session with key kai\n  3. b-i session with key kbi\n- Intruder initially knows agent identities, hash function, and its own keys\n\nAssumptions:\n- Client and server share a symmetric key Kab in advance\n- Nonces (Na, Nb) are freshly generated for each session\n- Hash function H is secure\n\nLimitations Abstracted:\n- Concrete message structure details (bit lengths, etc.)\n- Protocol redundancies in Dolev-Yao model\n- Focuses on core data dependencies\n\nSecurity Classification:\n- G1, G2 (Authentication properties)\n- G12 (Secrecy properties)\n\nThis description captures all the essential elements needed to reconstruct the HLPSL specification while maintaining the protocol's security properties and behavior.

Protocol Overview:\n- This protocol implements delayed entity and message authentication for DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) as specified in RFC 3118.\n- It provides a mechanism for clients to authenticate DHCP servers using a pre-shared key.\n- The protocol uses HMAC-based authentication with replay protection.\n\n2. Protocol Roles:\n- Client (C): Initiates the authentication process by sending a request\n- Server (S): Responds to authentication requests and proves its identity\n\n3. Protocol Flow:\n1) Client \u2192 Server: C, delayedAuthReq, Time1\n   - Client sends authentication request with a fresh nonce (Time1)\n   \n2) Server \u2192 Client: S, delayedAuthReq, succ(Time1), KeyID(K), H(S, delayedAuthReq, succ(Time1), K)\n   - Server responds with:\n     * Its identity (S)\n     * Successor of the client's nonce (succ(Time1))\n     * Key identifier (KeyID(K))\n     * HMAC of the response using the shared key K\n\n4. Security Features:\n- Replay protection through monotonically increasing counter (modeled as succ(Time1))\n- HMAC-based message authentication\n- Delayed authentication mechanism\n- Pre-shared key between client and server\n\n5. Cryptographic Components:\n- Shared secret key (K) between client and server\n- Hash function (H) for HMAC computation\n- Key identifier function (KeyID)\n- Successor function (succ) for counter increment\n\n6. Security Goals:\n- Secrecy of the shared key (sec_k)\n- Authentication of the server to the client (sig)\n   * G1: Entity authentication\n   * G2: Message authentication\n   * G3: Key confirmation\n   * G12: Secrecy of the shared key\n\n7. Limitations Modeled:\n- Simplified message structure (abstracting away length fields)\n- Nonce used instead of timestamp for replay protection\n- Fixed algorithm selection (HMAC)\n- Single authentication method (delayed auth)\n\n8. Intruder Knowledge:\n- The intruder knows:\n  * Agent identities (a, b)\n  * Some compromised keys (k2, k3)\n  * Protocol constants (delayedAuthReq, keyid, h, succ)\n  * Its own identity (i)\n\n9. Composition:\n- Three parallel sessions modeled:\n  1) Honest client and server (using key k1)\n  2) Honest client with intruder (using key k2)\n  3) Intruder with honest server (using key k3)\n\nThis description captures all the essential elements needed to reconstruct the HLPSL specification while maintaining the protocol's security properties and verification goals. The protocol provides delayed authentication with replay protection while ensuring the secrecy of the shared key."]]}, "HLPSL-1/Three-factor_fast_authentication_scheme_for_e-health_systems_in_5G_wireless_sensor_network.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "role user (U, S: agent, Kus, SKij: symmetric_key, Ks: public_key, H, H1, H2, H6, H7, H14, H16: hash_func, SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by U def=\n\n  local State: nat,\n        IDi, IDinew, IDj, Nj, PWi, Bi, E, Ej, Xj, V, N, N1, BBi, W, Yij, Tu, Ts, T1, T2, A, As, B, Bs, SKijNew: text, K, Q, Ay, By: message\n\n  init State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n% Registration phase\n% U \u2192 S: {IDi, W, BBi}Kus\n% where W = H(H(PWi||E)\u2295h(xor(IDi,IDj))||E)\n% and BBi = H(PWi||Bi)\n\n\t1.

Clear separation between different protocol phases\n\nAll original HLPSL code remains unchanged, and the annotations are semantically correct based on the protocol operations. The file can still be processed by AVISPA as the annotations are in comment format."]], "logic": [[true, "Here is a detailed description of the protocol based on the provided HLPSL file:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\nThis protocol is a mutual authentication and key agreement scheme between a user (U) and a server (S) with three phases: Registration, Login & Initial Authentication, and Fast Authentication. The protocol uses symmetric and public-key cryptography along with multiple hash functions for security.\n\n#### Roles:\n1. **User (U)**: The client who wants to authenticate with the server.\n2. **Server (S)**: The authentication server that verifies the user's credentials.\n\n#### Cryptographic Primitives:\n- Symmetric keys: `Kus` (shared between U and S), `SKij` (session key)\n- Public key: `Ks` (server's public key)\n- Hash functions: `H, H1, H2, H6, H7, H14, H16`\n\n#### Phases:\n\n1. **Registration Phase**:\n   - User sends `{IDi, W, BBi}` encrypted with `Kus` to the server, where:\n     - `W = H(H(PWi.E) XOR h(xor(IDi,IDj), E))`\n     - `BBi = H(PWi.Bi)`\n   - Server responds with `{IDi, Nj, Yij}` encrypted with `Kus`, where:\n     - `Yij = {H(Xj).IDj.IDi.W.BBi}_Xj` (Xj is server's secret)\n   - User computes `Ej = E XOR {H(Xj).IDj.IDi.W.BBi}_Xj` and stores it.\n\n2. **Login & Initial Authentication Phase**:\n   - User generates fresh values `V` and `Tu`, computes:\n     - `N = H(H(H(V)))`\n     - `A = BBi XOR W XOR Tu`\n     - Sends `{IDi, IDj, Yij, N, A, Tu}` encrypted with `Ks`\n   - Server verifies `Tu`, decrypts `Yij` using `Xj`, checks IDs and computes:\n     - `B = H(N) XOR Ts` (fresh `Ts`)\n     - Generates new IDs and timestamps `T1, T2`\n     - Computes session key `SKij = H(N XOR Yij)`\n     - Sends `{B, IDinew, ATa, ATb, Ts}` encrypted with `SKij` along with `T1, T2`\n\n3. **Fast Authentication Phase**:\n   - User sends `Ay = H(H1(ATa)).H(H2(ATb))`\n   - Server verifies `Ay` and responds with `{H(Ay XOR IDinew)}_SKij`\n\n#### Security Properties:\n- **Secrecy**: \n  - `g1`: User's secret `E`\n  - `g2`: User's identity `IDi`\n  - `g3`: User's password `PWi`\n  - `g4`: User's biometric `Bi`\n  - `g5`: Server's secret `Xj`\n  - `g6`: Server's secret `As`\n  - `g7`: Server's secret `Bs`\n- **Authentication**:\n  - `u_s_v`: User authenticates to server on `V`\n  - `u_s_tu`: User authenticates to server on `Tu`\n  - `s_u_ts`: Server authenticates to user on `Ts`\n\n#### Intruder Knowledge:\nThe intruder knows public identities (`u, s`), public keys (`ks, ki`), and the private key `inv(ki)`.\n\n### How to Generate HLPSL File:\nTo recreate this HLPSL file, you would:\n1. Define the roles (`user`, `server`, `session`, `environment`) with their respective parameters.\n2. Specify the transitions for each phase with the exact message computations.\n3. Declare all cryptographic primitives and channels.\n4. Set up the composition of roles in the environment.\n5. Define the security goals (secrecy and authentication).\n\nThis description captures all the essential elements needed to reconstruct the HLPSL specification for AVISPA analysis. The protocol appears to be a biometric-based authentication scheme with session key establishment and mutual authentication properties."]]}, "HLPSL-1/SPEKE.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL*: SPEKE\n%% VARIANT: SPEKE (with strong password-only authentication)\n%% PURPOSE: Strong Password-Only Authenticated Key Exchange\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\url{http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/jablon96strong.html}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%%  \\item Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n%%  \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%% A -> B : exp(S(A,B), Na)     |    key exchange part\n%% B -> A : exp(S(A,B), Nb)     |\n%%\n%%               both A and B compute\n%%               K = exp(exp(S(A,B),Na), Nb) = exp(exp(S(A,B),Nb), Na)\n%%\n%% A -> B : {Ca}_K              |\n%% B -> A : {Cb,Ca}_K           |    challenge/response\n%% A -> B : {Cb}_K              |    authentication part\n%%\n%% S(A,B): password (shared key)\n%% \\end{verbatim}\n%%\n%% LIMITATIONS: None\n%%\n%% PROBLEMS: 3\n%%\n%% CLASSIFICATION: G2 G12\n%%\n%% ATTACKS: None\n%% NOTES: None\n%%\t\n%%HLPSL:\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nrole speke_Init (A,B: agent,\n                 Kab: symmetric_key,\n                 Snd,Rcv: channel(dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n                 \n  local  State: nat,             % Current state of the initiator\n         Na,Ca: text,            % Nonce and challenge generated by A\n         Cb   : text,            % Challenge received from B\n         X,K  : message          % Temporary variables for received message and computed key\n\n  const  sec_i_Ca, sec_i_Cb : protocol_id  % Protocol identifiers for secrecy properties\n\n  init   State := 0              % Initial state\n\n  transition\n\n   % Transition 1: Initiate protocol by sending exp(Kab, Na)\n   1.

Honest session between A and B with shared key kab\n  2. Session between A and intruder with key kai\n  3. Session between intruder and B with key kbi\n- The intruder initially knows the identities and the keys it shares with A and B (kai, kbi)\n\n**Security Classification**:\n- The protocol provides both secrecy (G12) and authentication (G2) properties\n\nThis description captures all the essential elements needed to understand and potentially recreate the HLPSL specification for the SPEKE protocol. The protocol follows a clear challenge-response pattern after establishing a shared key through password-based exponential key exchange."]]}, "HLPSL-1/ISO2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL*: ISO2 Public Key Unilateral Authentication Protocol\n%% VARIANT: two-pass unilateral authentication\n%% PURPOSE: Authentication of a client to a server.

The file remains fully executable by AVISPA\n\nThe notations provide a clear understanding of the Kerberos protocol implementation in HLPSL while preserving all original functionality."]], "logic": [[true, "Here's a comprehensive description of the Kerberos V5 protocol based on the provided HLPSL file:\n\n### Protocol Description: Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)\n\n#### Overview\nKerberos is a distributed authentication service that enables secure authentication between clients and servers in a network environment. The protocol uses symmetric key cryptography and ticket-based authentication to verify identities without transmitting passwords over the network.\n\n#### Protocol Roles\n1. **Client (C)**: The entity requesting authentication and service access\n2. **Authentication Server (AS/A)**: Issues Ticket Granting Tickets (TGTs)\n3. **Ticket Granting Server (TGS/G)**: Issues service tickets\n4. **Server (S)**: The service the client wants to access\n\n#### Key Components\n- **Tickets**: Encrypted credentials containing session keys and authentication data\n- **Session Keys**: Temporary symmetric keys established during protocol execution\n- **Timestamps**: Used for freshness and to prevent replay attacks\n\n#### Protocol Phases\n\n##### 1. Authentication Service Exchange\n1. Client \u2192 AS: `C, G, Lifetime_1, N1`\n   - Requests Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)\n2. AS \u2192 Client: `C, Ticket_1, {G, K_CG, Tstart, Texpire, N1}K_CA`\n   - Returns encrypted TGT and session key for TGS\n\n##### 2. Ticket Granting Service Exchange\n3. Client \u2192 TGS: `S, Lifetime_2, N2, Ticket_1, {C, T}K_CG`\n   - Requests service ticket using TGT\n4. TGS \u2192 Client: `C, Ticket_2, {S, K_CS, Tstart2, Texpire2, N2}K_CG`\n   - Returns service ticket and session key for server\n\n##### 3. Client/Server Authentication Exchange\n5. Client \u2192 Server: `Ticket_2, {C, T2}K_CS`\n   - Presents service ticket for authentication\n6. Server \u2192 Client: `{T2}K_CS`\n   - Optional mutual authentication\n\n#### Security Properties\n- **Secrecy**: Session keys (K_CG, K_CS) must remain secret\n- **Authentication**:\n  - Weak authentication between Client and AS on K_CG\n  - Weak authentication between Client and TGS on K_CS\n  - Weak authentication between Client and Server on timestamps\n- **Key Establishment**: Secure session key distribution between parties\n\n#### Protocol Limitations\n- No ticket caching implemented (weak authentication only)\n- Timestamps are simplified as fresh text in the model\n\n#### Intruder Capabilities\nThe model includes an intruder (i) with knowledge of:\n- All agent identities\n- Its own long-term key (kia)\n- Standard Dolev-Yao capabilities\n\n#### Verification Goals\nThe model checks for:\n1. Secrecy of all session keys\n2. Weak authentication properties between all parties\n3. Proper key establishment and usage\n\nThis description captures all essential elements of the Kerberos V5 protocol as modeled in the HLPSL file, including the message flows, security properties, and verification goals. The protocol follows the standard Kerberos architecture while making appropriate simplifications for formal modeling."]]}}
