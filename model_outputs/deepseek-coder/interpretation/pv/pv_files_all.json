Decrypt messages if they have the private key\n2. Generate public keys from private keys\n3. Encrypt messages with known keys\n4. Extract messages from signatures\n5. Create signatures with known keys\n6. Perform symmetric encryption/decryption\n\n## Protocol Steps\n\n### 1. Server Registration\nWhen the server knows about two hosts (s1 and s2):\n- It generates and signs certificates containing:\n  - The host identity (host(s1) or host(s2))\n  - The host's public key (pk(s1) or pk(s2))\n- These certificates are signed with the server's private key (sS[])\n\n### 2. Client A's Message\nWhen Client A has:\n- Its own certificate (signed by server)\n- Another party's certificate (signed by server)\nIt will:\n1. Send both certificates\n2. Generate a session key k for the other party's public key (pkx)\n3. Sign this session key with its own private key (sA[])\n4. Encrypt the signed session key with the other party's public key\n\n### 3. Client B's Message\nWhen Client B receives:\n- A certificate claiming to be from Client A (but possibly forged)\n- Its own certificate\n- An encrypted signed session key\nIt will:\n1. Accept the session key if the signature verifies\n2. Use this key to symmetrically encrypt a secret (secret[])\n\n## Security Property\nThe protocol aims to keep \"secret[]\" confidential (query c:secret[]).\n\n## Expected Result\nThe verifier should determine that the secret can be compromised (reachable by attacker).\n\nThis description contains all the necessary information to reconstruct the original Horn file for ProVerif, including the protocol logic, cryptographic operations, and security properties to verify."]]}, "PV-1/DH.pv": {"code": [[true, "(* Channel declaration *)\nfree c : channel.\n\n(* Secret objective that we want to protect *)\nfree objective : bitstring [private].\n\n(* Cryptographic functions for Diffie-Hellman key exchange *)\nfun exp(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.

Cryptographic Primitives:\n- Asymmetric encryption/decryption (aenc/adec)\n- Digital signatures (sign/checksign)\n- Public key derivation (pkey)\n- Symmetric encryption/decryption (enc/dec) - defined but not used\n- Key storage table (keys)\n\n3. Protocol Flow:\n\nInitial Setup:\n- The server S initializes with A and B's public keys stored in its key table\n- Public keys pkA, pkB, and pkS are published on public channel c\n\nKey Registration Server:\n- Accepts registrations from hosts (except A and B)\n- Stores host-public key pairs in the keys table\n\nKey Retrieval Server:\n- Responds to key lookup requests by signing and returning the requested public key\n- Verifies requests using its private key skS\n\nClient A (Initiator):\n1. Requests public key of I from server S\n2. Receives and verifies signed response from S\n3. Sends message 1: aenc((Na, A), pkI)\n4. Receives message 2: aenc((Na, Ni), pkA)\n5.

Sends message 2: aenc((Na, Nb), pkA)\n5. Receives message 3: aenc(Nb, pkB)\n6. If verification succeeds, outputs secret objective\n\n4. Security Properties:\n- The main security query checks if the attacker can learn the secret 'objective'\n- The protocol aims to establish authenticated communication between A and B\n- Uses server-signed public keys to prevent MITM attacks\n- Nonces (Na, Nb) are used for freshness\n\n5.

Protocol Overview:\nThe Otway-Rees protocol is a key distribution protocol that allows two parties (A and B) to establish a shared secret key through a trusted server (S). The protocol uses symmetric cryptography and nonces to ensure freshness.\n\n2. Cryptographic Primitives:\n- Symmetric encryption: encrypt(plaintext, key)\n- Symmetric decryption: decrypt(ciphertext, key)\n- Key types: key (shared keys), nonce (fresh values)\n- Host types: host (participant identities)\n\n3. Participants:\n- Two honest hosts: A and B\n- A trusted server S\n- Each host shares a long-term key with the server:\n  - A shares Kas with S\n  - B shares Kbs with S\n\n4. Protocol Messages:\n1. A \u2192 B: (C, A, B, {Na, C, A, B}_Kas)\n   - A initiates with a fresh nonce C\n   - Includes identities A and B\n   - Encrypts Na and other info with Kas\n\n2. B \u2192 S: (C, A, B, {Na, C, A, B}_Kas, {Nb, C, A, B}_Kbs)\n   - B adds its own nonce Nb\n   - Encrypts Nb and other info with Kbs\n\n3. S \u2192 B: (C, {Na, Kab}_Kas, {Nb, Kab}_Kbs)\n   - Server generates fresh session key Kab\n   - Returns encrypted messages for both parties\n\n4. B \u2192 A: (C, {Na, Kab}_Kas)\n   - B forwards A's portion\n\n5. Security Properties:\n- Secrecy of secretA and secretB (verified by noninterf queries)\n- Authentication through nonce verification\n- Key freshness through nonces\n\n6.

It combines public-key cryptography with Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\nProtocol Components:\n1. Cryptographic Primitives:\n   - Public-key encryption: pk/1, encrypt/2, decrypt/2\n   - Hash functions: hash/1, keyhash/2\n   - Diffie-Hellman functions: f/2, g/1\n   - Symmetric encryption: sencrypt/2, sdecrypt/2\n\n2. Participants:\n   - Initiator (A)\n   - Responder (B)\n\n3. Protocol Steps:\n\n   Initial Setup:\n   - Both parties generate their public/private key pairs:\n     * A generates skA and publishes pkA = pk(skA)\n     * B generates skB and publishes pkB = pk(skB)\n\n   Protocol Execution:\n   1. A \u2192 B: (encrypt((pkA, Ka), pkB), g(x))\n      - A generates fresh nonces x and Ka\n      - A sends its public key and Ka encrypted with B's public key, along with g(x)\n\n   2. B \u2192 A: (encrypt(Kb, pkA), g(y), keyhash((g(x), g(y), pkB, pkA), K0))\n      - B decrypts the first message to get (pkA, Ka)\n      - B generates fresh nonces y and Kb\n      - B computes K0 = hash(Ka, Kb)\n      - B computes the session key sh = hash(f(y, g(x)))\n      - B sends Kb encrypted with A's public key, g(y), and a keyed hash\n\n   3. A \u2192 B: keyhash((g(y), g(x), pkA, pkB), K0)\n      - A decrypts Kb from the first part\n      - A computes K0 = hash(Ka, Kb)\n      - A verifies the keyed hash from B\n      - A computes the session key sh = hash(f(x, g(y)))\n      - A sends a confirmation keyed hash\n\nSecurity Properties:\n- The protocol aims to establish a shared secret (sh) between A and B\n- The protocol provides mutual authentication through the keyed hashes\n- Forward secrecy is provided through the Diffie-Hellman exchange\n- The model checks for non-interference of secrets secretA and secretB\n\nExpected Results:\n- Non-interference between secretA and secretB cannot be proved (they might be related)\n- Non-interference for secretA alone holds\n- Non-interference for secretB alone holds\n\nThis description contains all the necessary information to reconstruct the ProVerif pi file, including:\n- All cryptographic primitives and their equations\n- The exact message flows between participants\n- The internal computations performed by each party\n- The security properties being verified"]]}, "PV-1/piwoolam.pi": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Cryptographic Primitives:\n   - Symmetric encryption: encrypt(m,k) where m is message and k is key\n   - Decryption: decrypt(encrypt(m,k),k) = m\n   - Host/key mapping: host(x) represents a host with key x\n   - Key retrieval: getkey(host(x)) = x (private function)\n\n4. Protocol Flow:\n   a) A \u2192 B: A (initiator's identity)\n   b) B \u2192 A: N (fresh nonce)\n   c) A \u2192 B: {A,B,N}_kAS (triple encrypted with A's shared key with S)\n   d) B \u2192 S: {A,B,{A,B,N}_kAS}_kBS (forwarded message encrypted with B's shared key with S)\n   e) S \u2192 B: {A,B,N}_kBS (response encrypted with B's shared key with S)\n   f) B verifies the received message matches expected format\n\n5. Security Properties:\n   - Authentication: Verified through queries checking correspondence between begin/end events\n   - Secrecy assumptions: kBS and kAS are declared as private (not known to attacker)\n\n6. Process Definitions:\n   - processA: Initiator's behavior\n   - processB: Responder's behavior\n   - processS: Trusted server's behavior\n\n7. Main Process:\n   - Creates fresh keys kAS and kBS\n   - Creates host identities hostA and hostB\n   - Runs multiple instances of A, B, and S in parallel\n\n8. Security Queries:\n   - Checks injective correspondence for parameters (endBparam \u21d2 beginBparam)\n   - Checks injective correspondence for full session (endBfull \u21d2 beginBfull)\n\n9.

Protocol Participants:\n   - Two honest principals: A and B\n   - A trusted server S\n   - An attacker who may control other hosts\n\n2. Cryptographic Primitives:\n   - Public/private key pairs (pk/sk)\n   - Digital signatures (sign/checksign)\n   - Nonces for freshness\n\n3. Protocol Flow:\n\n   A \u2192 B: A\n   B \u2192 A: N (fresh nonce)\n   A \u2192 B: {N}_skA (signature of N with A's private key)\n   B \u2192 S: A\n   S \u2192 B: (A, {A, pkA}_skS) (certificate from server)\n\n4. Process Definitions:\n\n   a) Initiator (A):\n      - Receives identities (xA, xB0) from attacker\n      - Verifies xA is honest (A or B)\n      - Sends identity xA\n      - Receives nonce n\n      - Signs the nonce and sends back signature\n\n   b) Responder (B):\n      - Receives identity xB from attacker\n      - Verifies xB is honest\n      - Receives claimed identity xA0\n      - Generates fresh nonce n\n      - Receives signature of n\n      - Requests certificate from server\n      - Verifies signature against certified public key\n\n   c) Server (S):\n      - Receives identity request\n      - Looks up public key in key table\n      - Returns signed certificate\n\n   d) Key Registration:\n      - Allows registration of new (host, key) pairs\n      - Rejects registration for honest hosts A and B\n\n5.

Protocol Overview:\nThe Yahalom protocol is a key distribution protocol that establishes a session key between two parties (A and B) with the help of a trusted server (S). The protocol uses symmetric cryptography and nonces to ensure freshness and authentication.\n\n2. Participants:\n- Two honest hosts: A and B\n- A trusted server S\n- An optional key registration process for other hosts\n\n3. Cryptographic Primitives:\n- Symmetric encryption: encrypt(plaintext, key)\n- Symmetric decryption: decrypt(ciphertext, key)\n- Nonce generation\n- Type conversions (nonce_to_bitstring)\n\n4. Key Assumptions:\n- Kas: Pre-shared key between A and S\n- Kbs: Pre-shared key between B and S\n- Kab: Session key generated by S for A and B\n- The attacker cannot obtain Kas or Kbs (not attacker(new Kas/Kbs))\n\n5. Protocol Messages:\n\nMessage 1 (A \u2192 B):\n- A sends to B: (A, Na)\n  Where Na is a fresh nonce generated by A\n\nMessage 2 (B \u2192 S):\n- B sends to S: (B, encrypt((A, Na, Nb), Kbs))\n  Where Nb is a fresh nonce generated by B\n\nMessage 3 (S \u2192 A):\n- S sends to A: \n  (encrypt((B, Kab, Na, Nb), Kas), encrypt((A, Kab), Kbs))\n  Where Kab is a fresh session key generated by S\n\nMessage 4 (A \u2192 B):\n- A sends to B:\n  (encrypt((A, Kab), Kbs), encrypt(Nb, Kab))\n\n6. Protocol Roles:\n\na) Initiator (A):\n1. Receives identity xA (must be A or B)\n2. Retrieves corresponding key kas from key table\n3. Generates fresh nonce Na\n4. Sends (xA, Na)\n5. Receives two certificates\n6. Decrypts first certificate to verify B, Kab, Na, Nb\n7. Sends second certificate and encrypted Nb\n8. If verification passes, outputs secretA encrypted with Kab\n\nb) Responder (B):\n1. Receives identity xB (must be A or B)\n2. Retrieves corresponding key kbs from key table\n3. Receives (a, na)\n4. Generates fresh nonce Nb\n5. Sends (xB, encrypt((a, na, Nb), kbs))\n6. Receives two messages\n7. Decrypts second certificate to verify A and Kab\n8. Verifies Nb using Kab\n9. If verification passes, outputs secretB encrypted with Kab\n\nc) Server (S):\n1. Receives (h2, encrypted_message)\n2. Retrieves k2 (key for h2)\n3. Decrypts message to get (h1, n1, n2)\n4. Retrieves k1 (key for h1)\n5. Generates fresh session key k\n6. Sends two encrypted messages:\n   - encrypt((h2, k, n1, n2), k1)\n   - encrypt((h1, k), k2)\n\nd) Key Registration:\n- Allows registration of new host-key pairs\n- Only accepts keys for hosts other than A and B\n\n7. Security Properties:\n- Non-interference for secretA (holds)\n- Non-interference for secretB (holds)\n- Non-interference for both secretA and secretB together (does not hold)\n\n8. Process Composition:\nThe protocol runs with:\n- Unbounded instances of initiator, responder, and server\n- Key registration process\n- Initial setup of keys for A and B\n\nThis description provides all the necessary details to reconstruct the ProVerif file while maintaining the protocol's security properties and behavior.

The protocol provides authentication and key distribution.\n\n## Protocol Roles\n1. **Initiator (A)**: Starts the protocol to establish a session with B\n2. **Responder (B)**: Participates in the protocol to establish a session with A\n3. **Server (S)**: Trusted third party that generates and distributes session keys\n\n## Cryptographic Primitives\n- Symmetric encryption: `encrypt(plaintext, key)`\n- Decryption: `decrypt(ciphertext, key)`\n- Hostname-key mapping: `host(key)` and `getkey(hostname)`\n\n## Protocol Messages\nThe protocol proceeds in four message exchanges:\n\n1. **A \u2192 B**: `A, N_A`\n   - A sends its identity and a fresh nonce to B\n\n2. **B \u2192 S**: `B, N_B, {A, N_A}_Kbs`\n   - B forwards A's message (encrypted with B's key shared with S) along with its own identity and fresh nonce\n\n3. **S \u2192 A**: `N_B, {B, K_ab, N_A}_Kas, {A, K_ab, N_B}_Kbs`\n   - Server generates fresh session key K_ab\n   - Returns:\n     - B's nonce\n     - Message for A (encrypted with A's key shared with S)\n     - Message for B (encrypted with B's key shared with S)\n\n4. **A \u2192 B**: `{A, K_ab, N_B}_Kbs, {N_B}_Kab`\n   - A forwards B's message and adds an encrypted nonce to prove it knows K_ab\n\n## Security Properties\nThe protocol is designed to provide:\n1. **Secrecy**: The session key K_ab and secrets (secretA, secretB) should remain confidential\n2. **Authentication**:\n   - Agreement on N_B between A and B\n   - Agreement on the session key K_ab\n   - Event correspondence properties to verify authentication\n\n## ProVerif Verification Goals\n1. Secrecy of `secretA` and `secretB`\n2. Authentication properties:\n   - `endAparam(x) ==> beginAparam(x)`\n   - `endBparam(x) ==> beginBparam(x)`\n   - `endBkey(x,y,z,t) ==> beginBkey(x,y,z,t)`\n\n## Process Definitions\n1. **Process A**:\n   - Generates nonce N_A\n   - Initiates protocol with B\n   - Verifies server's response\n   - Completes protocol by sending final message\n\n2. **Process B**:\n   - Receives initiation from A\n   - Generates nonce N_B\n   - Contacts server for session key\n   - Verifies final message from A\n\n3. **Process S**:\n   - Receives request from B\n   - Generates fresh session key K_ab\n   - Prepares encrypted messages for both parties\n\n## Initial Setup\nThe system initializes with:\n- Two long-term keys: `kas` (A's key with S) and `kbs` (B's key with S)\n- Parallel composition of replicated processes for A, B, and S\n\nThis description contains all the necessary information to reconstruct the original ProVerif pi file, including the protocol flow, cryptographic operations, security properties, and process definitions."]]}, "PV-1/denning-sacco-orig.horntype": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

It's a password-authenticated key exchange protocol where two parties establish a shared secret key using a pre-shared password.\n\n## Protocol Entities\n- Two hosts: A and B\n- Each host can act as both initiator (processA) and responder (processB)\n\n## Cryptographic Primitives\n1. **Symmetric Encryption (weak)**: Used with passwords\n   - `enc(m, pwd)`/`dec(m, pwd)`: Encryption/decryption where decryption success is not verifiable\n   - Equations ensure proper encryption/decryption behavior\n\n2. **Symmetric Encryption (strong)**: Used with established keys\n   - `senc(m, key)`/`sdec(m, key)`: Encryption/decryption where decryption success is verifiable\n\n3. **Public Key Cryptography**\n   - `penc(m, pk)`/`pdec(m, sk)`: Public key encryption/decryption\n   - `pk(sk)`: Derives public key from private key\n\n4. **Type Converters**\n   - `nonce_to_bitstring(nonce)`: Converts nonces to bitstrings\n   - `pkey_to_bitstring(pkey)`: Converts public keys to bitstrings\n\n## Protocol Messages\n\n### Initiator (processA) Steps:\n1. Generates a new private key `sEA` and derives public key `EA`\n2. Sends: `(hostA, enc(pkey_to_bitstring(EA), P))`\n3. Receives response `m2`\n4. Decrypts `m2` with password `P` then decrypts result with `sEA` to get `R`\n5. Generates challenge `challengeA`\n6. Sends: `senc(nonce_to_bitstring(challengeA), R)`\n7. Receives response `m4`\n8. Decrypts `m4` with `R` to get `(challengeA, challengeB)`\n9. Verifies challenge and sends: `senc(nonce_to_bitstring(challengeB), R)`\n\n### Responder (processB) Steps:\n1. Receives initiator's message `(hostX, m)`\n2. Decrypts `m` with password `P` to get `EA`\n3. Generates new session key `R`\n4. Sends: `enc(penc(R, EA), P)`\n5. Receives challenge `m3`\n6. Decrypts `m3` with `R` to get `challengeA`\n7. Generates `challengeB`\n8. Sends: `senc((challengeA, challengeB), R)`\n9. Receives final message and verifies `challengeB`\n\n## Password Setup\n- Three private passwords defined:\n  - `PAB`: Shared between A and B\n  - `PAA`: Used when A communicates with itself\n  - `PBB`: Used when B communicates with itself\n\n## Security Property\nThe protocol includes a test for password secrecy using observational equivalence:\n- In phase 1, the adversary is given either the real password `PAB` or a fresh random password `w`\n- The \"RESULT Observational equivalence is true\" indicates the password remains secret\n\n## Process Composition\nThe complete system consists of multiple parallel processes:\n- A and B communicating with themselves (using PAA/PBB)\n- A and B communicating with each other (using PAB)\n- The password secrecy test process\n\nThis description provides all the necessary information to reconstruct the ProVerif file, including:\n- All cryptographic operations and their properties\n- The complete message flow\n- The process structure and composition\n- The security property being verified"]]}, "PV-1/needham.horn": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Declaring the cryptographic primitives\n2. Modeling the protocol steps as processes\n3. Specifying the attacker capabilities\n4. Defining the security queries\n\nThe protocol appears to be a variant of a public-key based authentication protocol, possibly inspired by Needham-Schroeder or similar protocols, though with some unusual elements (like the self-encryption)."]]}, "PV-1/NeedhamSchroederSK.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Cryptographic Primitives:\n- Symmetric encryption/decryption (encrypt/decrypt functions)\n- Shared keys between hosts and server\n- Nonces for freshness\n- Tags (c0, c1) for message identification\n\n3. Protocol Roles:\n\nA. Initiator (processInitiator):\n1. Receives identity (xA) and partner host (h) from environment\n2. Verifies xA is honest (A or B) and retrieves shared key kas\n3. Generates fresh nonce Na\n4. Sends (xA, h, Na) to partner\n5. Receives encrypted response, decrypts with kas to get (Na, h, k, m)\n6. Verifies nonce matches and forwards m to partner\n7. Receives challenge, responds with confirmation\n8. If partner is honest, completes protocol and sends encrypted secret\n\nB. Responder (processResponder):\n1.

Sends encrypted response containing:\n   - Original nonce n\n   - Partner identity h2\n   - New session key k\n   - Encrypted message for h2 containing (k, h1)\n\nD. Key Registration (processK):\n- Allows registration of new host-key pairs\n- Only accepts keys for hosts other than A and B\n\n4.

Participants:\n- Two clients: A and B\n- A key server (S)\n- Potentially other participants (I represents an initiator)\n\n2. Cryptographic Primitives:\n- Asymmetric encryption (aenc/adec)\n- Digital signatures (sign/checksign)\n- Public/private key pairs (pkey)\n- Symmetric encryption (enc/dec) - though not used in main protocol\n\n3. Key Infrastructure:\n- The server maintains a table of public keys (keys table)\n- Clients can register their public keys with the server (if not A or B)\n- Clients can retrieve others' public keys through authenticated responses from the server\n\n4. Protocol Flow:\n\nClient A (Initiator):\n1. Retrieves I's public key from server:\n   - Sends (A, I) to server\n   - Receives signed (I, pkI) from server\n   - Verifies signature using server's public key\n\n2. Sends message 1: aenc((Na, A), pkI)\n   - Na is a fresh nonce\n   - Encrypted with I's public key\n\n3. Receives message 2: aenc((Na, Ni, I), skA)\n   - Decrypts with own private key\n   - Verifies Na matches sent nonce\n   - Extracts Ni (I's nonce) and I's identity\n\n4. Sends message 3: aenc(Ni, pkI)\n   - Encrypts I's nonce with I's public key\n\nClient B (Responder):\n1. Retrieves A's public key from server:\n   - Sends (B, A) to server\n   - Receives signed (A, pkA) from server\n   - Verifies signature using server's public key\n\n2. Receives message 1: aenc((Na, A), skB)\n   - Decrypts with own private key\n   - Extracts Na and verifies A's identity\n\n3. Sends message 2: aenc((Na, Nb, B), pkA)\n   - Nb is a fresh nonce\n   - Encrypted with A's public key\n\n4. Receives message 3: aenc(Nb, skB)\n   - Decrypts with own private key\n   - Verifies Nb matches sent nonce\n   - If successful, outputs the secret objective\n\nKey Server Operations:\n1. Key Retrieval:\n   - Receives (src, dst) pair\n   - Looks up dst's public key in table\n   - Returns signed (dst, pkDst) using server's private key\n\n2. Key Registration:\n   - Receives (host, pk) pair\n   - If host is neither A nor B, adds to keys table\n\nSecurity Property:\n- The query \"attacker(objective)\" checks whether the attacker can learn the secret objective value\n\nThis protocol appears to be a modified version of a public-key based authentication protocol, possibly inspired by Needham-Schroeder, where clients authenticate each other through nonce exchange with the help of a trusted key server. The server provides authenticated public keys to clients, who then use these keys to establish secure communication.\n\nFrom this description, one could reconstruct the original ProVerif file as it contains all the essential elements:\n- Cryptographic primitives and equations\n- Process definitions for all participants\n- The main process composition\n- Key infrastructure management\n- Security query"]]}, "PV-1/piwoolampk.pi": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Initialization:\n   - Generate private keys skA, skB, skS for A, B, and S respectively\n   - Compute corresponding public keys pkA, pkB, pkS\n   - Create host identities hostA and hostB bound to their public keys\n   - Publish public keys and host identities on public channel c\n\n2. Process A (Initiator):\n   a. Receives hostB0 (intended responder)\n   b. Begins protocol by sending its identity hostA\n   c. Receives nonce challenge n from B\n   d. Signs the tuple (hostA, hostB0, n) with its private key skA\n   e. Sends the signature to B\n\n3. Process B (Responder):\n   a. Receives claimed identity hostA0 from initiator\n   b. Generates fresh nonce n and sends it to A\n   c. Receives signature m from A\n   d. Contacts trusted server S to verify A's public key:\n      - Sends hostA0 to S\n      - Receives (hostA0, sign((hostA0, pkA2), skS)) from S\n   e. Verifies:\n      - Signature from S is valid\n      - Signature from A is valid and contains correct identities and nonce\n   f. If verification succeeds, records successful authentication via events\n\n4. Process S (Trusted Server):\n   a. Receives host identity request\n   b. Responds with the host identity and its signed public key certificate\n\nSecurity Properties Verified:\n1. Correspondence between endBparam and beginBparam events\n2. Correspondence between endBfull and beginBfull events\n   (These verify authentication properties showing that if B completes the protocol, A must have initiated it with the claimed parameters)\n\nAssumptions:\n- Private keys skA, skB, skS are never compromised\n- Public keys are correctly bound to host identities\n- Trusted server S is honest\n\nThis description maintains all the essential elements of the protocol as specified in the ProVerif file and could be used to regenerate an equivalent pi file that would run in ProVerif.

The protocol ensures that only the intended recipient can decrypt the final message `s`.\n\n**Cryptographic Primitives:**\n1. **Digital Signatures:**\n   - `sign(m, k)` - Signs message `m` with private key `k`\n   - `pk(k)` - Derives public key from private key `k`\n   - `checksign(sig, pk)` - Verifies signature with public key\n   - Properties: Correctness of signature verification\n\n2. **Symmetric Encryption:**\n   - `enc(x, y)` - Encrypts message `x` with key `y`\n   - `dec(c, y)` - Decrypts ciphertext `c` with key `y`\n   - Property: Correct decryption with matching key\n\n3. **Diffie-Hellman:**\n   - Base element `g` of type `G`\n   - `exp(g, n)` - Exponentiation operation\n   - Commutativity property: `exp(exp(g, x), y) = exp(exp(g, y), x)`\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Both parties generate their key pairs (`skA`, `pkA`) and (`skB`, `pkB`)\n   - Public keys are published on channel `c`\n\n2. **Party A's Role:**\n   - Receives a public key `pkX` (expected to be `pkB`)\n   - Generates fresh exponent `n0`\n   - Sends signed DH component: `sign(exp(g, n0), skA)` and `pkA`\n   - Receives signed response from B\n   - Verifies the signature and computes shared key `k = exp(x1, n0)`\n   - If the public key matches `pkB`, sends encrypted secret `s` using key `k`\n\n3. **Party B's Role:**\n   - Receives signed message and public key from A\n   - Verifies signature using received public key\n   - Generates fresh exponent `n1`\n   - Computes shared key `k = exp(x0, n1)`\n   - Sends back signed DH component: `sign(exp(g, n1), skB)`\n   - Receives and decrypts the final message using key `k`\n\n**Security Property:**\nThe protocol aims to keep the secret `s` confidential, verified by the query `query attacker(s)` which checks whether `s` can be obtained by the attacker.\n\n**Process Composition:**\nThe main process creates key pairs for both parties, publishes their public keys, and runs multiple instances of both roles in parallel (`!p0 | !p1`).\n\n**Expected Result:**\nThe verification should confirm that `attacker(s)` is false, meaning the secret `s` remains confidential against active attackers.\n\nThis description contains all the necessary information to reconstruct the ProVerif file, including:\n- All cryptographic primitives and their properties\n- The exact protocol flow between parties\n- The process composition\n- The security property being verified\n- The expected verification result\n\nThe protocol implements proper authentication through signatures and provides forward secrecy through ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exponents, while ensuring the confidentiality of the final transmitted secret."]]}, "PV-1/WooLamSK.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Initiator (A)\n2. Responder (B)\n3. Server (S)\n\nThe protocol aims to authenticate A to B using pre-shared symmetric keys (kAS between A and S, kBS between B and S).\n\n## Protocol Messages\nThe message flow consists of:\n1. A \u2192 B: A (initiator's identity)\n2. B \u2192 A: N (fresh nonce)\n3. A \u2192 B: {A,B,N}_kAS (encrypted tuple with kAS)\n4. B \u2192 S: {A,B,{A,B,N}_kAS}_kBS (double encrypted message)\n5. S \u2192 B: {A,B,N}_kBS (server's response)\n6. B verifies the final message matches expectations\n\n## Cryptographic Primitives\n- Symmetric encryption: `encrypt(plaintext, key)`\n- Symmetric decryption: `decrypt(ciphertext, key)`\n- Properties: `decrypt(encrypt(x,y),y) = x` (correct decryption)\n\n## Participants and Setup\n- Two honest hosts: A and B\n- Each has a shared key with server S:\n  - A's key: Kas (shared with S)\n  - B's key: Kbs (shared with S)\n- Key table maintained via `keys(host, key)` facts\n\n## Protocol Roles\n\n### Initiator (A)\n1. Receives (xA, xB2) to start session\n2. Verifies xA is honest (A or B)\n3. Retrieves xA's shared key kas from key table\n4. Outputs xA to start protocol\n5. Receives nonce N from responder\n6. Encrypts (xA, xB2, N) with kas and sends it\n\n### Responder (B)\n1. Receives identity xB to start session\n2. Verifies xB is honest (A or B)\n3. Retrieves xB's shared key kbs from key table\n4. Receives initiator's identity xA2\n5. Generates fresh nonce N and sends it\n6. Receives encrypted message and forwards to server\n7. Verifies server's response matches expectations\n\n### Server (S)\n1. Receives encrypted message from B\n2. Decrypts outer layer with kbs\n3. Retrieves A's key kas\n4. Decrypts inner layer with kas\n5. Re-encrypts (A,B,N) with kbs and sends to B\n\n## Security Properties\nThe protocol verifies two authentication properties:\n1. Weak authentication (`beginBparam/endBparam`):\n   - If B completes a session with A, then A must have started a session with B\n2. Strong authentication (`beginBfull/endBfull`):\n   - If B completes a session with A using nonce N, then A must have started a session with B with that nonce\n\n## Additional Components\n- Key registration process allows registering keys for other hosts\n- Main process initializes keys for A and B and spawns all roles\n\n## Expected Results\nThe protocol should satisfy both authentication properties when types are respected (no type confusion attacks).\n\nThis description contains all the necessary information to reconstruct the ProVerif file, including:\n- Protocol message flow\n- Cryptographic operations\n- Participant roles\n- Security properties\n- Initial setup\n- Expected behavior"]]}}
