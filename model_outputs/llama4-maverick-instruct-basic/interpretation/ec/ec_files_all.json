The scheme is defined in the `CramerShoup` module, which consists of three procedures: `kg`, `enc`, and `dec`.\n\n*   `kg`: The key generation procedure generates a public key `pk` and a secret key `sk`. The public key consists of a group element `g`, a group element `g_` (where `g_` is `g` raised to a random power `w`), and three group elements `e`, `f`, and `h` (`h` is used for masking the plaintext). The secret key consists of the exponents `x1`, `x2`, `y1`, `y2`, `z1`, and `z2` used to compute `e`, `f`, and `h`, respectively.\n*   `enc`: The encryption procedure takes a plaintext message `m` and the public key `pk` as input and produces a ciphertext `c`. The ciphertext consists of four group elements: `a`, `a_` (where `a_` is `a` raised to the power `w`), `c` (which is the masked plaintext), and `d` (which is a tag computed using `a`, `a_`, and `c`).\n*   `dec`: The decryption procedure takes a ciphertext `c` and the secret key `sk` as input and produces the original plaintext message `m` if the ciphertext is valid.\n\n**Security Proof:**\n\nThe security of the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme is proven in the `Security` section. The proof is based on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption and the Target Collision Resistance (TCR) of the hash function used in the scheme.\n\nThe proof involves a series of games, where an adversary `A` is given access to an oracle that implements the encryption and decryption procedures. The goal of the adversary is to distinguish between encryptions of two different plaintexts.\n\nThe proof shows that the advantage of the adversary in distinguishing between the two plaintexts is bounded by the advantage of the adversary in breaking the DDH assumption, the TCR of the hash function, and some additional terms that depend on the number of decryption queries made by the adversary.\n\nThe final result is a bound on the advantage of the adversary in breaking the CCA security of the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme.\n\nTo recreate the ec file, one would need to define the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme and its security proof using the EasyCrypt tool. The protocol and its security proof involve complex cryptographic concepts, such as the DDH assumption and TCR, which are modeled using various modules and lemmas in the ec file.\n\n**Modules and Lemmas:**\n\nThe ec file consists of several modules and lemmas that are used to define the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme and its security proof. Some of the key modules and lemmas include:\n\n*   `CramerShoup`: The module that defines the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme.\n*   `DDH_ex`: A module that defines the DDH experiment.\n*   `B_DDH`: A module that defines a reduction from the CCA security of the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme to the DDH assumption.\n*   `B_TCR`: A module that defines a reduction from the CCA security of the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme to the TCR of the hash function.\n*   `aux1` and `aux2`: Lemmas that bound the advantage of the adversary in breaking the CCA security of the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme.\n*   `conclusion`: The final lemma that states the security result for the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme.\n\nBy understanding the definitions and proofs in the ec file, one can recreate the file and verify the security of the Cramer-Shoup encryption scheme using the EasyCrypt tool."]]}, "EC-1/GuessGame.ec": {"code": [[false, "To add notation to the given EasyCrypt file without changing the original code and ensuring that the added notations are semantically correct, we'll follow the guidelines and syntax provided by EasyCrypt for adding notations.

PIR is a cryptographic primitive that allows a client to retrieve a specific element from a database without revealing which element it is interested in.\n\n**Protocol Components**\n\n1. **Database**: The database is represented by a function `a` that maps integers to words (bit-vectors). The database contains `N` elements, where `N` is a positive integer.\n\n2. **Client**: The client is implemented by the `PIR` module. The client has two procedures: `query` and `main`.\n\n   *   **`query` procedure**: This procedure takes a list of integers `s` as input and returns the XOR of the elements in the database corresponding to the indices in `s`.\n   *   **`main` procedure**: This procedure takes an integer `i` as input, representing the index of the element the client wants to retrieve. It generates two lists `s` and `s'` based on random coin tosses and the input `i`. The lists are constructed such that their symmetric difference is `{i}`. The client then queries the database with `s` and `s'` using the `query` procedure and returns the XOR of the two results.\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe code proves two main security properties:\n\n1.  **Correctness**: The protocol is correct, meaning that the output of the `main` procedure is the element in the database corresponding to the input index `i`. This is proven by the `PIR_correct` lemma.\n\n2.  **Security**: The protocol is secure, meaning that the distribution of the lists `s` and `s'` generated by the client is independent of the input index `i`. This is proven by the `PIR_secuity_s_bypr` and `PIR_secuity_s'_bypr` lemmas, which show that the probability distributions of `s` and `s'` are uniform and identical for any input index.\n\n**Alternative Proof**\n\nThe code also provides an alternative proof of the security property using a different approach.

They take a plaintext message `p` and a key `k` as inputs.\n\n1. **Mac-then-Encrypt (MtE)**: \n   - The MtE scheme first generates a tag `t` for the plaintext message `p` using a MAC scheme with key `mk`.\n   - It then encrypts the pair `(p, t)` using an SKE scheme with key `ek`.\n   - The final ciphertext is the result of the encryption.\n\n2. **Encrypt-then-MAC (EtM)**: \n   - The EtM scheme first encrypts the plaintext message `p` using an SKE scheme with key `ek`.\n   - It then generates a tag `t` for the ciphertext `c` using a MAC scheme with key `mk`.\n   - The final ciphertext is the pair `(c, t)`.\n\n**Security Proof**\n\nThe security proof involves two main parts: \n\n1. **IND$-CPA Security**: \n   - The proof shows that if the underlying SKE scheme is IND$-CPA secure, then both MtE and EtM are IND$-CPA secure.\n   - For MtE, this involves showing that an adversary's ability to break the IND$-CPA security of MtE can be reduced to their ability to break the IND$-CPA security of the underlying SKE scheme.\n   - For EtM, a similar reduction is made.\n\n2. **INT-PTXT/INT-CTXT Security**: \n   - The proof shows that if the underlying MAC scheme is SUF-CMA (strongly unforgeable under chosen-message attacks) secure, then MtE is INT-PTXT (plaintext integrity) secure and EtM is INT-CTXT (ciphertext integrity) secure.\n   - For MtE, this involves showing that an adversary's ability to break the INT-PTXT security of MtE can be reduced to their ability to break the SUF-CMA security of the underlying MAC scheme.\n   - For EtM, a similar reduction is made to show INT-CTXT security.\n\nThe EasyCrypt file formalizes these reductions using game-based security proofs. It defines the MtE and EtM schemes, the security notions (IND$-CPA, INT-PTXT, INT-CTXT, SUF-CMA), and then proves the security reductions.\n\n**Key Takeaway**\n\nThe MtE and EtM schemes provide authenticated encryption by combining SKE and MAC schemes.

The scheme consists of three main procedures:\n\n1. **Key Generation (`kg`)**: Generates a public key (`pkey`) and a secret key (`skey`). The secret key `sk` is sampled uniformly from the field `F`, and the public key is computed as `g ^ sk`, where `g` is a generator of the group.\n\n2. **Encryption (`enc`)**: Takes a public key (`pk`) and a plaintext (`m`) as input. It samples a random `y` from the field `F`, computes `g ^ y` and `pk ^ y * m`, and returns the ciphertext `(g ^ y, pk ^ y * m)`.\n\n3. **Decryption (`dec`)**: Takes a secret key (`sk`) and a ciphertext (`c`) as input. It decrypts the ciphertext by computing `gm * gy^(-sk)`, where `(gy, gm)` is the ciphertext `c`, and returns the decrypted plaintext.\n\n**Security Proof**\n\nThe security proof is based on the IND-CPA (Indistinguishability under Chosen-Plaintext Attack) security notion, which is a standard security requirement for public-key encryption schemes.\n\nThe proof involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Defining the Adversary and Security Game**: An adversary `A` is defined, which is assumed to be able to interact with the encryption scheme in a CPA game. The CPA game involves the adversary choosing two plaintexts (`m0` and `m1`), receiving an encryption of one of them under the public key, and then guessing which plaintext was encrypted.\n\n2. **Reduction to DDH**: A reduction is defined from the CPA game to the DDH game. Specifically, a DDH adversary (`DDHAdv(A)`) is constructed from the CPA adversary `A`. The DDH adversary receives a DDH triple (`gx`, `gy`, `gz`) and uses it to simulate the CPA game for `A`.\n\n3. **Proving Equivalence**: The probability of `A` winning the CPA game is related to the probability of `DDHAdv(A)` winning the DDH game. Two intermediate lemmas (`cpa_ddh0` and `ddh1_gb`) are used to establish this relation. These lemmas show that the probability of `A` winning the CPA game is equal to the probability of `DDHAdv(A)` winning the DDH game when the input is a DDH triple with `z = xy` (i.e., `DDH0` game), and that the probability of `DDHAdv(A)` winning the DDH game when `z` is random (i.e., `DDH1` game) is equivalent to a game (`Gb`) where the adversary's guess is compared to a random bit.\n\n4. **Concluding the Proof**: The final lemma (`conclusion`) combines the results of the previous lemmas to show that the advantage of `A` in the CPA game is equal to the advantage of `DDHAdv(A)` in the DDH game. This establishes that if the DDH assumption holds, then the Hashed ElGamal encryption scheme is IND-CPA secure.\n\nThis description should be sufficient to regenerate the corresponding EasyCrypt file."]]}, "EC-1/hashed_elgamal_std.ec": {"code": [[true, "and", "To add notation to the given EasyCrypt code without changing the original code and ensuring the added notations are semantically correct, we need to understand the existing code structure and identify where notations can be appropriately added.\n\nThe given code is a cryptographic proof for the Hashed ElGamal encryption scheme, involving various modules and lemmas to prove its security under certain assumptions.\n\nHere's the modified code with added notation, enclosed within ```ec and ```:\n\n```ec\n(* -------------------------------------------------------------------- *)\nrequire import AllCore Int Real Distr DBool.\nrequire (*--*) DiffieHellman BitWord PKE_CPA.\n\n(* Notation for distributions *)\nnotation \"`$`"]], "logic": [[true, "Here is a description of the protocol based on the provided EasyCrypt file:\n\n**Protocol: Hashed ElGamal Public-Key Encryption Scheme**\n\nThe Hashed ElGamal public-key encryption scheme is a cryptographic protocol that provides secure encryption and decryption of messages.
