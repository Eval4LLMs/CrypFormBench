The **Encryptor** (processE): responsible for encrypting messages.\n2. The **Key Generator** (process): generates the public key and interacts with the Encryptor.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. **Key Generation**: The Key Generator generates a secret key `x` and computes the corresponding public key `alpha = exp(gamma, x)`, where `gamma` is a uniform generator. The public key is sent to the Encryptor over the channel `cPK`.\n2. **Encryption**: The Encryptor receives two messages `m0` and `m1` and randomly selects a bit `b`. It then computes the ciphertext `(beta, zeta)` as follows:\n\t* `beta = exp(gamma, y)`, where `y` is a random exponent.\n\t* `delta = exp(alpha, y)`.\n\t* `zeta = dot(delta, m_b)`, where `m_b` is the message corresponding to the selected bit `b`.\n\tThe ciphertext is sent to the Key Generator over the channel `cEret`.\n3. **Interaction**: The Key Generator initiates the protocol by sending a start signal over the channel `start`. The Encryptor receives the public key over `cPK` and sends the ciphertext over `cEret` after receiving the messages `m0` and `m1` over `cE`.\n\n**Security Assumptions**\n\nThe protocol's security relies on the Decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH) assumption, which states that it is computationally infeasible to distinguish between the distributions `(exp(gamma, x), exp(gamma, y), exp(gamma, xy))` and `(exp(gamma, x), exp(gamma, y), exp(gamma, z))`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are random exponents.\n\nThe CV file models this assumption using the `equiv` statement, which proves that the two distributions are computationally indistinguishable under the DDH assumption.\n\n**Security Property**\n\nThe protocol is designed to ensure the secrecy of the bit `b` used to select the message `m_b`. The `query` statement in the CV file checks that the bit `b` remains secret.\n\nOverall, the ElGamal encryption scheme is a simple and efficient public-key encryption scheme that is secure under the DDH assumption.

The security claim is formalized using the `equiv` statement, which states that the real-world execution of the protocol is computationally indistinguishable from an ideal-world execution.\n\nIn the real-world execution, the protocol generates a `keyseed` `k`, a public key `pkgen(k)`, and a secret key `skgen(k)`. It then executes `N` encryption queries using the `enc` function with random `enc_seed`s, and `N2` decryption queries using the `dec` function with the secret key.\n\nIn the ideal-world execution, the protocol simulates the encryption queries by generating ciphertexts using the `enc` function with a zero-knowledge plaintext (`Z(m)`), and stores the plaintext-ciphertext pairs in a table `cipher`. The decryption queries are simulated by looking up the ciphertext in the `cipher` table and returning the corresponding plaintext if found, or decrypting the ciphertext using the secret key otherwise.\n\nThe security claim states that the probability of distinguishing between the real-world and ideal-world executions is bounded by `N * Penc(time + (N-1) * time(enc, maxlength(m)), N2)`, where `Penc` is a probability term that depends on the time complexity of the encryption function and the maximum length of the plaintext.\n\n**Process**\n\nThe protocol defines a process that executes the real-world execution of the protocol.\n\nThis description should be sufficient to regenerate the corresponding CV file.

The signer then computes the signature `s` by applying the `mf` function to the secret key `sk` and the hash of the message `m` concatenated with the random seed `sr`.\n3. **Signature Verification**: The verifier receives the message `m2`, the random seed `sr`, and the signature `s`. The verifier checks if the signature `s` is valid by verifying that `f(pk, s)` equals the hash of `m2` concatenated with `sr`.

Otherwise, the verifier triggers the `bad` event.\n\n**Security Property**\n\nThe protocol aims to ensure that the `bad` event is not triggered.

A random bit `secb` is generated, which determines whether the protocol will test the correctness of the decapsulation or not.\n3. A KEM key pair is generated using `cca_gen` with `hk2` and a random key seed `r`.\n4. The public key `pk` and secret key `sk` are extracted from the KEM key pair.\n5. A random key seed `k` is generated, and the encapsulation `KEMEncaps(c, K)` is computed using `cca_encaps` with `hk`, `hk2`, `hk3`, `pk`, and `k`.\n6. The protocol then runs three oracle processes: `hashoracleKDF(hk)`, `hashoracleH(hk2)`, and `hashoracleG1(hk3)`.\n7. The protocol outputs the result of the decapsulation `cca_decap(hk, hk2, hk3, ct, sk)` if `secb` is true, or the result of checking whether the ciphertext `ct` is equal to `c` and the public key `pk'` is equal to `pk` if `secb` is false.\n\n**Security Property**\n\nThe protocol is designed to prove the IND-CCA2 security of the KEM scheme.

These hash functions are used to provide randomness and to mask the plaintext data.\n3. **XOR Operations**: The protocol uses XOR operations to combine the plaintext data with the output of the hash functions.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Key Generation**: The protocol generates a public key `pk` and a secret key `sk` using a key generation algorithm `pkgen` and `skgen`, respectively.\n2. **Encryption**: The protocol takes two plaintext messages `m1` and `m2` as input and randomly selects a bit `b1`. It then computes the ciphertext using the following steps:\n\t* Computes `menc = test(b1, m1, m2)`, where `test` is a function that returns `m1` if `b1` is true and `m2` otherwise.\n\t* Generates a random seed `r` and computes `s = xorDow(concatm(menc, zero), G(hkg,r))`, where `G` is a hash function and `hkg` is a hash key.\n\t* Computes `t = xorDr(r, H(hkh,s))`, where `H` is another hash function and `hkh` is a hash key.\n\t* Computes the ciphertext `f(pk, concat(s,t))`, where `f` is the trapdoor permutation function.\n3. **Output**: The protocol outputs the ciphertext on a public channel `c2`.\n\n**Security Property:**\n\nThe protocol is designed to prove the CPA security of the OAEP scheme. The security property is defined as the secrecy of the bit `b1`, which is used to select between the two plaintext messages `m1` and `m2`. The protocol is secure if an adversary cannot distinguish between the two plaintext messages with a non-negligible advantage.\n\n**Random Oracles:**\n\nThe protocol uses two random oracles, `G` and `H`, to model the hash functions.

The proof involves a sequence of games, where each game represents a different scenario.

Here is a possible description:\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\nThe protocol is a cryptographic protocol that involves two honest peers, A and B, and a public key infrastructure (PKI). The protocol uses a combination of Diffie-Hellman key exchange, digital signatures, and a hash function modeled as a random oracle.\n\n**Protocol Participants**\n\n* Two honest peers, A and B, with identities represented by the type `host`.\n* A PKI that manages the public keys of the participants.\n\n**Protocol Setup**\n\n1. The protocol starts with the generation of key pairs for A and B using the `keygen` function, which produces a secret key and a corresponding public key.\n2. The public keys of A and B are made available through the PKI.\n\n**Protocol Execution**\n\n1. The protocol involves two processes, `processA` and `processB`, which represent the actions taken by A and B, respectively.\n2. The processes use a hash function, `hf`, which is modeled as a random oracle.\n3. The processes also use the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism, which is based on a finite group `G` and a field of exponents `Z`.\n4. The protocol uses digital signatures, which are generated using the `sign` function and verified using the `verify` function.\n\n**Security Assumptions**\n\n1. The protocol relies on the security of the Diffie-Hellman key exchange, which is based on the hardness of the Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) problem.\n2. The protocol also relies on the security of the digital signature scheme, which is based on the Unforgeability under Chosen Message Attack (UF-CMA) property.\n3. The hash function is modeled as a random oracle, which means that it is assumed to be collision-resistant and preimage-resistant.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\n1. The protocol aims to achieve secrecy and authentication goals, although the specific queries and events are not defined in the provided ocv file.\n\n**Probabilistic Assumptions**\n\n1. The protocol uses several probabilistic assumptions, including:\n\t* `PCollKey1` and `PCollKey2`, which bound the probability of certain events related to the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\t* `pCDH`, which bounds the probability of breaking the CDH assumption.\n\t* `Psign` and `Psigncoll`, which bound the probability of breaking the UF-CMA property of the digital signature scheme.\n\nUsing this description, it should be possible to generate a corresponding ocv file that can be run by Cryptoverif.

It involves a client and a server that initially share a random traffic secret.\n\n**Key Components**\n\n1. **Key Derivation**: The protocol uses a key derivation function (HKDF) to derive three keys from the initial traffic secret: an updated traffic secret (`traffic_secret_Nplus1`), a key (`k`) for authenticated encryption, and an initialization vector (`iv`) for nonce generation.\n2. **Authenticated Encryption**: The protocol uses an authenticated encryption scheme (AEAD) with empty additional data to encrypt and decrypt messages. The AEAD scheme is assumed to be IND-CPA and INT-CTXT secure, provided the nonce is distinct for each encryption.\n3. **Nonce Generation**: The protocol generates nonces using the `xor` function, which takes the initialization vector (`iv`) and a sequence number (`count`) as inputs.\n4. **Sequence Number Management**: The protocol uses two tables to record previously used sequence numbers: `table_count_send` and `table_count_recv`. These tables ensure that sequence numbers are not reused.\n\n**Protocol Flow**\n\n1. The client and server initially share a random traffic secret (`traffic_secret_N`).\n2. The client derives the updated traffic secret (`traffic_secret_Nplus1`), key (`k`), and initialization vector (`iv`) using HKDF.\n3.

The client then outputs the ciphertext.\n\t* The server (`receive` process) receives input from the environment, checks that the sequence number (`count`) has not been used before in the current session, and decrypts the received ciphertext using AEAD with the derived key (`k`) and nonce (`xor(iv, count)`).\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe CV file proves the following security properties:\n\n1. **Secrecy of Plaintexts**: The protocol ensures the secrecy of the plaintexts being transmitted.\n2. **Message Authenticity**: The protocol ensures that received messages were indeed sent by the client.\n3. **Secrecy of Updated Key**: The protocol ensures the secrecy of the updated traffic secret (`traffic_secret_Nplus1`).\n\nOverall, this protocol appears to be a secure communication protocol that protects the confidentiality and authenticity of transmitted data."]]}, "CV-1/woolampkcorrSimp.cv": {"code": [[false, "To add notation to the given CV file without modifying the original code and ensuring that the final CV code file can be run by CryptoVerif, I'll provide the annotated version of the code.

It involves two parties, A and B, where B initiates the protocol by sending a nonce and its identity to A.

It then runs multiple instances of `processA` and `processB` in parallel.\n\nThis description should be sufficient to generate a corresponding CV file that can be run by Cryptoverif."]]}}
