The protocol aims to establish a shared session key between the two parties and ensure the secrecy and freshness of the exchanged data.\n\n**Protocol Participants**\n\n* Initiator (I)\n* Responder (R)\n\n**Protocol Messages**\n\n1. `I -> R: I, ni` - The initiator sends its identity and a fresh nonce `ni` to the responder.\n2. `R -> I: {ni, kir, R}k(I, R)` - The responder responds with a message encrypted under the shared key `k(I, R)` between the initiator and responder. The message contains the initiator's nonce `ni`, a fresh session key `kir`, and the responder's identity `R`.\n3. `I -> R: {ni}kir` - The initiator sends a message encrypted under the session key `kir`, containing its original nonce `ni`.\n4. `R -> I: nr` - The responder sends a fresh nonce `nr` to the initiator.\n\n**Security Claims**\n\nThe protocol makes the following security claims:\n\n* `claim_I1(I, Nisynch)` and `claim_R1(R, Nisynch)`: The initiator and responder claim that the protocol is synchronized, ensuring that the messages are exchanged in the correct order.\n* `claim_I2(I, Secret, kir)` and `claim_R2(R, Secret, kir)`: Both parties claim that the session key `kir` is secret and shared only between them.\n* `claim_I3(I, Empty, (Fresh, kir))` and `claim_R3(R, Empty, (Fresh, kir))`: The parties claim that the session key `kir` is fresh, meaning it has not been used before.\n\n**Notes**\n\n* The shared key `k(I, R)` between the initiator and responder is modelled as a symmetric key, but the protocol does not explicitly state that `k(I, R) = k(R, I)`. This might limit the detection of certain attacks that rely on this property.\n* The order of the messages has been adjusted to prevent trivial synchronization attacks.\n\n**Known Attacks**\n\nAccording to the SPORE library, there are no known attacks on this modified version of the Andrew Secure RPC protocol.\n\nThis description should be sufficient to regenerate the provided SPDL file, which can be used to analyze the protocol's security properties using the Scyther tool."]]}, "SPDL-1/tls-BM-1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/*\n * This is a model of a version of the TLS protocol as modeled in\n * Boyd, Mathuria \"Protocols for Authentication and key establishment\"\n *\n * It's a very simplified form.\n */\n\n/* below is just Scyther input and no further macro definitions */\n\nconst pk,hash: Function;\nsecret sk,unhash: Function;\ninversekeys(pk,sk);\ninversekeys(hash,unhash);\n\nconst Alice, Bob, Eve: Agent;\nconst Terence: Agent;\n\n/* TLS-BM-1 Protocol Definition */\nprotocol tls-bm-1(A,B)\n{\n\t/* Role A (Initiator) */\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\t/* Fresh nonces generated by A */\n\t\tfresh na: Nonce;\n\t\tfresh pmk: Nonce;\n\t\tvar nb: Nonce; /* Nonce received from B */\n\n\t\t/* Send nonce na to B */\n\t\tsend_1( A,B, na );\n\t\t/* Receive nonce nb from B */\n\t\trecv_2( B,A, nb );\n\t\t\n\t\t/* Send encrypted pmk, signed hash of na, nb, and {pmk}pk(B), \n\t\t   and a hashed confirmation using pmk, na, and nb */\n\t\tsend_3( A,B, { pmk }pk(B),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A)) }hash(pmk,na,nb) );\n\t\t\n\t\t/* Receive confirmation from B */\n\t\trecv_4( B,A, { na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A)) }hash(pmk,na,nb) }hash(pmk,na,nb) );\n\n\t\t/* Claim that hash(pmk,na,nb) is a secret */\n\t\tclaim_A1( A, Secret, hash(pmk,na,nb) );\n\t\t/* Claim that A is in synchronization (Nisynch) with B */\n\t\tclaim_A2( A, Nisynch );\n\t\t/* Additional notation: Alive and Weakagree claims for A */\n\t\tclaim_A3( A, Alive );\n\t\tclaim_A4( A, Weakagree );\n\t}\t\n\t\n\t/* Role B (Responder) */\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\tvar na: Nonce; /* Nonce received from A */\n\t\tvar pmk: Nonce; /* pmk received from A */\n\t\tfresh nb: Nonce; /* Fresh nonce generated by B */\n\n\t\t/* Receive nonce na from A */\n\t\trecv_1( A,B, na );\n\t\t/* Send nonce nb to A */\n\t\tsend_2( B,A, nb );\n\t\t\n\t\t/* Receive encrypted pmk, signed hash, and hashed confirmation from A */\n\t\trecv_3( A,B, { pmk }pk(B),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A)) }hash(pmk,na,nb) );\n\t\t\n\t\t/* Send confirmation to A */\n\t\tsend_4( B,A, { na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B),{ hash(na,nb,{ pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A)) }hash(pmk,na,nb) }hash(pmk,na,nb) );\n\n\t\t/* Claim that hash(pmk,na,nb) is a secret */\n\t\tclaim_B1( B, Secret, hash(pmk,na,nb) );\n\t\t/* Claim that B is in synchronization (Nisynch) with A */\n\t\tclaim_B2( B, Nisynch );\n\t\t/* Additional notation: Alive and Weakagree claims for B */\n\t\tclaim_B3( B, Alive );\n\t\tclaim_B4( B, Weakagree );\n\t}\n}", "The given SPDL file models a simplified version of the TLS protocol.

Description**\n================================\n\nThe TMN (Tahoe, Meadows, and Neuman) protocol is a three-party key exchange protocol that involves two parties, traditionally referred to as Alice (A) and Bob (B), and a trusted server, Simon (S). The primary goal of this protocol is to establish a shared secret key between Alice and Bob with the assistance of Simon.\n\n**Protocol Overview**\n--------------------\n\n1. **Key Generation and Distribution**: The protocol begins with Alice generating a fresh key, `Ka`, and Bob generating another fresh key, `Kb`. Both keys are intended to be used as shared secrets.\n   \n2. **Message Flow**:\n   - **Step 1**: Alice encrypts her key `Ka` with Simon's public key `pk(S)` and sends it to Simon, indicating her intention to communicate with Bob.\n   - **Step 2**: Simon receives Alice's message and sends a notification to Bob, indicating that Alice wishes to establish a connection.\n   - **Step 3**: Bob encrypts his key `Kb` with Simon's public key and sends it to Simon.\n   - **Step 4**: Simon decrypts both `Ka` and `Kb`, re-encrypts `Kb` with `Ka`, and sends it to Alice.\n\n3. **Key Establishment**: By the end of the protocol, both Alice and Bob possess a shared secret key. Alice receives `Kb` encrypted with `Ka` from Simon and decrypts it to obtain `Kb`. Thus, both Alice and Bob know `Kb`, achieving their goal of establishing a shared secret.\n\n**Security Claims**\n-------------------\n\nThe protocol includes several security claims:\n- **Alice Claims**:\n  - `claim_5(A, Secret, Ka)`: Alice claims that `Ka` remains a secret.\n  - `claim_8(A, Secret, Kb)`: After receiving and decrypting the message from Simon, Alice also claims that `Kb` is a secret.\n- **Bob Claims**:\n  - `claim_6(B, Secret, Kb)`: Bob claims that his generated key `Kb` remains secret.\n- **Simon Claims**:\n  - `claim_7(S, Secret, Ka)`: Simon claims that he has kept `Ka` secret.\n\n**Analysis with Scyther**\n-------------------------\n\nThe provided SPDL file models this protocol for analysis with the Scyther tool. Scyther is used for the formal verification of security protocols, checking for potential vulnerabilities such as man-in-the-middle attacks or key compromises.\n\nThe SPDL file accurately models the roles of Alice, Bob, and Simon, detailing the messages exchanged and the security claims made by each participant. It defines the cryptographic primitives used, such as public-key encryption with `pk(S)` and the corresponding secret key `sk(S)`, and specifies that `pk` and `sk` are inverse keys.\n\nTo recreate this SPDL file based on the description, one would:\n1. Define the types and constants used (e.g., `Key`, `pk`, `sk`, and the agents involved).\n2. Specify the protocol's roles and their respective actions (sending and receiving messages, generating fresh keys).\n3. Include the security claims relevant to each role.\n\nBy following these steps and accurately modeling the TMN protocol, one can generate an SPDL file that can be analyzed using Scyther to verify the protocol's security properties."]]}, "SPDL-1/woo-lam.spdl": {"code": [[false, "To add the notation to the given SPDL file without changing the original code and ensuring it remains semantically correct and runnable by Scyther, we will focus on adding comments and possibly additional claims or variables if necessary for notation purposes.

It includes several helper protocols (`@publickeys`, `@exponentiation`, `@addmult`, `@keyswap`) that are used to simulate certain properties or actions within the main protocol (`HMQV-twopass`).\n\n2. **Identify Claimed Properties**: The main protocol (`HMQV-twopass`) includes `claim` statements for a property named `SKR`. This suggests that the protocol is claiming some security property related to the session key (`SKR`).\n\n3. **Add Notation for Claimed Properties**: To add notation, we can include additional `claim` statements for other relevant security properties such as `Secret`, `Alive`, `Weakagree`, or `Nisynch` if applicable. For key agreement protocols like HMQV, we are typically interested in the secrecy of the derived session key and possibly authentication properties.\n\n4. **Modify the Protocol**: We will add `claim` statements for `Secret` to verify that the session key remains secret. We will also add claims for authentication properties if necessary.\n\nHere's how you can modify the `HMQV-twopass` protocol to include additional notation for claimed properties:\n\n```spdl\n/* \n * HMQV two pass version\n *\n */\n\n// Hash functions\nhashfunction h1,h2,gexp,exp,KDF,H;\n\n// Addition, multiplication\n// For now, simply hashes\nhashfunction mult,add;\n\n/*\n * Hack to simulate public knowledge of public keys.\n */\nprotocol @publickeys(PK)\n{\n\trole PK\n\t{\n\t\tsend_!1(PK,PK, gexp(sk(PK)));\n\t}\n}\n\t\t\n/*\n * Hack to simulate g^ab = g^ba inside terms.\n * '@' prefix of protocol name denotes helper protocol, which is used by\n * Scyther for displaying, and such protocols are ignored in\n * auto-generation of protocol modifiers.\n */\nprotocol @exponentiation(RA,RB,RC)\n{\n\trole RA\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!1(RA,RA, h2(\n\t\t  exp(gexp(X),Y),\n\t\t  T1, T2, RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t\tsend_!2(RA,RA, h2(\n\t\t  exp(gexp(Y),X),\n\t\t  T1, T2, RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t}\n\trole RB\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!3(RB,RB, h2(\n\t\t  T1,\n\t\t  exp(gexp(X),Y),\n\t\t  T2, RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t\tsend_!4(RB,RB, h2(\n\t\t  T1,\n\t\t  exp(gexp(Y),X),\n\t\t  T2, RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t}\n\trole RC\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!5(RC,RC, h2(\n\t\t  T1, T2,\n\t\t  exp(gexp(X),Y),\n\t\t  RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t\tsend_!6(RC,RC, h2(\n\t\t  T1, T2,\n\t\t  exp(gexp(Y),X),\n\t\t  RA,RB\n\t\t  ));\n\t}\n}\n\nprotocol @addmult(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!1(I,I, add(X,Y) );\n\t\tsend_!2(I,I, add(Y,X) );\n\t}\n\trole R\n\t{\n\t\tvar X,Y: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_!3(R,R, mult(X,Y) );\n\t\tsend_!4(R,R, mult(Y,X) );\n\t}\n}\n\nprotocol @keyswap(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tvar x,y: Nonce;\n\t\trecv_!1(I,I, KDF(exp(mult(gexp(y),exp(gexp(sk(R)),H(gexp(y),I))),add(x,mult(H(gexp(x),R),sk(I))))) );\n\t\tsend_!2(I,I, KDF(exp(mult(gexp(x),exp(gexp(sk(I)),H(gexp(x),R))),add(y,mult(H(gexp(y),I),sk(R))))) );\n\t}\n}\n\n// The protocol description\n\nsymmetric-role protocol HMQV-twopass(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tfresh x: Nonce;\n\t\tvar Y: Ticket;\n\t\tvar SessKey: Ticket;\n\n\t\tsend_1(I,R, gexp(x) );\n\t\trecv_2(R,I, Y );\n\n\t\tSessKey := KDF(exp(mult(Y,exp(gexp(sk(R)),H(Y,I))),add(x,mult(H(gexp(x),R),sk(I)))));\n\t\tclaim(I,SKR, SessKey );\n\t\tclaim(I,Secret,SessKey);\n\t\tclaim(I,Alive);\n\t}\t\n\t\n\trole R\n\t{\n\t\tfresh y: Nonce;\n\t\tvar X: Ticket;\n\t\tvar SessKey: Ticket;\n\n\t\trecv_1(I,R, X );\n\t\tsend_2(R,I, gexp(y) );\n\n\t\tSessKey := KDF(exp(mult(X,exp(gexp(sk(I)),H(X,R))),add(y,mult(H(gexp(y),I),sk(R)))));\n\t\tclaim(R,SKR, SessKey );\n\t\tclaim(R,Secret,SessKey);\n\t\tclaim(R,Alive);\n\t}\n}\n```\n\nThe modifications include:\n- Adding a `SessKey` variable in both roles to explicitly store the computed session key.\n- Adding a `claim` for `Secret` to check if the session key remains secret.\n- Adding a `claim` for `Alive` to check for aliveness, which is a basic authentication property.\n\nThis modification is semantically correct as it directly relates to the properties one would typically verify in a key agreement protocol.

The initiator generates a fresh nonce `x` and sends the value `g^x` to the responder. The responder generates a fresh nonce `y` and sends the value `g^y` to the initiator.\n\n**Key Derivation**\n\nUpon receiving the other's public value, each party computes a shared secret key using the HMQV key derivation function. The key derivation function involves the following steps:\n\n1. Compute `\u03c3 = (g^y)^((x + H(g^x, R) \\* sk(I))` (for the initiator) or `\u03c3 = (g^x)^((y + H(g^y, I) \\* sk(R))` (for the responder), where `sk(I)` and `sk(R)` are the private keys of the initiator and responder, respectively.\n2. Compute the shared secret key `K = KDF(\u03c3)`, where `KDF` is a key derivation function.\n\n**Claims**\n\nThe protocol includes two claims:\n\n1. The initiator claims that the shared secret key `K` is a secret key between the initiator and the responder (claim `SKR`).\n2. The responder claims that the shared secret key `K` is a secret key between the responder and the initiator (claim `SKR`).\n\n**Helper Protocols**\n\nThe SPDL file includes several helper protocols that simulate certain properties, such as:\n\n* `@publickeys`: Simulates public knowledge of public keys.\n* `@exponentiation`: Simulates the property that `g^(ab) = g^(ba)`.\n* `@addmult`: Simulates the commutativity of addition and multiplication.\n* `@keyswap`: Simulates the key swap operation.\n\nThese helper protocols are used to facilitate the verification of the HMQV two-pass protocol using the Scyther tool.\n\nWith this description, you should be able to generate a corresponding SPDL file that can be run by Scyther."]]}, "SPDL-1/ikev2-mac.spdl": {"code": [[false, "To add notation to the given SPDL file without changing the original code and ensuring the final SPDL code can be run by Scyther, we will carefully examine the protocol description and identify areas where notation can be added for clarity and semantic correctness.\n\nThe protocol described involves several roles and messages exchanged between them, including Diffie-Hellman key exchange (`DH` role), a swap protocol (`SWAP` role), an executability protocol (`E` role), and the main `ikev2-mac` protocol with `I` (initiator) and `R` (responder) roles."]], "logic": [[true, "**Protocol Description: IKEv2-MAC**\n\nThe IKEv2-MAC protocol is a cryptographic key exchange protocol used to establish a secure connection between two parties, typically referred to as the initiator (I) and the responder (R).

The protocol is based on the Diffie-Hellman key exchange and uses hash functions to derive the shared secret key.\n\n**Protocol Participants:**\n\n* Initiator (I): The entity that initiates the key exchange.\n* Responder (R): The entity that responds to the key exchange.\n\n**Protocol Messages:**\n\n1. I \u2192 R: `g1(x)`, where `x` is a fresh nonce generated by I.\n2. R \u2192 I: `g1(y)`, where `y` is a fresh nonce generated by R.\n\n**Key Derivation:**\n\nThe shared secret key is derived using the hash function `h1` and the following inputs:\n\n* `g2(beta, sk(I))`, where `beta` is `g1(y)` received from R, and `sk(I)` is the private key of I.\n* `g2(pk(R), x)`, where `pk(R)` is the public key of R, and `x` is the nonce generated by I.\n* `I` and `R`, the identities of the Initiator and Responder.\n\nThe Responder derives the shared secret key using a similar computation:\n\n* `g2(pk(I), y)`, where `pk(I)` is the public key of I, and `y` is the nonce generated by R.\n* `g2(alpha, sk(R))`, where `alpha` is `g1(x)` received from I, and `sk(R)` is the private key of R.\n* `I` and `R`, the identities of the Initiator and Responder.\n\n**Security Claims:**\n\nThe protocol claims to provide Secure Key Receipt (SKR) for both the Initiator and Responder, ensuring that the derived shared secret key is secure.\n\n**Helper Protocols:**\n\nThe SPDL file includes two helper protocols, `@publickeys` and `@exponentiation`, which are used to simulate certain properties of the protocol.

The goal is to establish a shared secret key between I and R.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. **Initiator (I)**:\n\t* Generates a fresh nonce `s` and a fresh nonce `x`.\n\t* Sends a message to R containing its identity `I`, the nonce `s`, and the value `g1(x)`, where `g1` is a hash function.\n2. **Responder (R)**:\n\t* Receives the message from I and extracts the values `I`, `s`, and `alpha = g1(x)`.\n\t* Generates a fresh nonce `y`.\n\t* Sends a message to I containing its identity `R`, the nonce `s`, the value `g1(y)`, and a signature `{ R,s,g1(y),alpha,I }sk(R)`, where `sk(R)` is R's private key.\n3. **Initiator (I)**:\n\t* Receives the message from R and extracts the values `R`, `s`, `beta = g1(y)`, and the signature.\n\t* Verifies the signature using R's public key.\n\t* Sends a message to R containing its identity `I`, the nonce `s`, and a signature `{ I,s,g1(x),beta,R }sk(I)`, where `sk(I)` is I's private key.\n4. **Responder (R)**:\n\t* Receives the message from I and extracts the values `I`, `s`, and the signature.\n\t* Verifies the signature using I's public key.\n\n**Security Claims**\n\n* Both I and R claim the session identifier `s` as a secret (claims `SID`).\n* Both I and R claim the value `g2(alpha,y)` (or `g2(beta,x)`) as a shared secret key (claims `SKR`), where `alpha = g1(x)` and `beta = g1(y)`.\n\n**Helper Protocol: @exponentiation**\n\nThe `@exponentiation` protocol is a helper protocol used to simulate the property `g^ab = g^ba`.
