A sends `P` and `G` to B over a public channel `c`.\n2. **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**:\n\t* A computes `mod(exp(G, Na), P)` and sends it to B.\n\t* B generates a secret number `Nb`, receives `P` and `G` from A, and computes `mod(exp(G, Nb), P)`. B sends this value to A.\n\t* A receives B's value and computes the shared secret `s = mod(exp(B, Na), P)`.\n\t* B computes the shared secret `s = mod(exp(A, Nb), P)`.\n3. **Encrypted Objective**: A encrypts a secret `objective` using the shared secret `s` and sends the ciphertext to B (although B doesn't actually receive or process it).\n\n**Security Goal**\n\nThe protocol aims to keep the `objective` secret from an attacker. The security query `query attacker(objective)` checks whether an attacker can obtain the `objective`.\n\n**Cryptographic Primitives**\n\nThe protocol uses the following cryptographic primitives:\n\n* `exp` and `mod` functions to perform modular exponentiation, which is used for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n* `enc` and `dec` functions for symmetric encryption and decryption, respectively, with the property that `dec(enc(m, k), k) = m`.\n\nThe PV file models the protocol using these primitives and checks the security goal using the ProVerif tool. \n\nWith this description, you should be able to generate a similar PV file.

Public-key cryptography: `pk/1`, `encrypt/2`, and `decrypt/2` are used for encryption and decryption using public and private keys.\n2. Hash function: `hash/1` is used to compute a hash value.\n3. Diffie-Hellman key exchange: `f/2` and `g/1` are used to compute a shared secret key using the Diffie-Hellman algorithm.\n4. Keyed hash function: `keyhash/2` is used to compute a keyed hash value.\n5. Shared-key cryptography: `sencrypt/2` and `sdecrypt/2` are used for encryption and decryption using a shared secret key.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\nThe protocol involves two parties, A and B, and consists of the following steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: A and B generate their public and private key pairs, `pkA` and `skA`, and `pkB` and `skB`, respectively. They publish their public keys on a public channel `c`.\n2. **A's Initiation**: A receives B's public key `pkX` (which may or may not be `pkB`) from the public channel `c`. A generates a random value `x` and a key `Ka`, encrypts `(pkA, Ka)` using `pkX`, and sends the encrypted message along with `g(x)` to B over the public channel `c`.\n3. **B's Response**: B receives the message from A, decrypts it using `skB`, and extracts `pkAr` (which should be `pkA`) and `Ka`. B generates a random value `y` and a key `Kb`, computes the shared secret key `K0 = hash((Ka, Kb))`, and sends `(encrypt(Kb, pkAr), g(y), keyhash((g(y), m2, pkB, pkAr), K0))` to A over the public channel `c`.\n4. **A's Verification**: A receives B's response, decrypts `m1` to obtain `Kb`, computes `K0 = hash((Ka, Kb))`, and verifies the keyed hash value `m3`. If the verification succeeds, A computes the shared secret key `sh = hash(f(x, m2))` and sends `keyhash((m2, g(x), pkA, pkX), K0)` to B. If `pkX = pkB`, A sends `sencrypt(secretA, sh)` to B.\n5. **B's Verification**: B receives A's response, verifies the keyed hash value `m3`, and if successful, computes the shared secret key `sh = hash(f(y, m2))`. If `pkAr = pkA`, B sends `sencrypt(secretB, sh)` to A.\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe protocol is designed to achieve the following security properties:\n\n* Secrecy of `secretA` and `secretB`\n* Authentication between A and B\n\nThe ProVerif output indicates that the protocol satisfies the non-interference property for `secretA` and `secretB` individually but not jointly.\n\nThis description should enable you to generate a corresponding pi file that can be run by ProVerif."]]}, "PV-1/piwoolam.pi": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The protocol is designed to establish the authenticity of the initiator and responder with the help of the server.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. **A \u2192 B**: The initiator (A) sends its identity to the responder (B).\n2. **B \u2192 A**: The responder (B) generates a fresh nonce (N) and sends it to the initiator (A).\n3. **A \u2192 B**: The initiator (A) encrypts a message containing its identity, the responder's identity, and the nonce (N) using the shared key between A and S (kAS). The encrypted message is sent to the responder (B).\n4. **B \u2192 S**: The responder (B) encrypts the message received from A, along with its own identity and the identity of A, using the shared key between B and S (kBS). The encrypted message is sent to the server (S).\n5. **S \u2192 B**: The server (S) decrypts the message received from B, verifies the identities and the nonce, and then encrypts a message containing the identities and the nonce using the shared key between B and S (kBS). The encrypted message is sent to the responder (B).\n6. **B**: The responder (B) verifies the message received from S by decrypting it and checking if it matches the expected values.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve two security goals:\n\n1. **Authentication**: The responder (B) should be able to verify the authenticity of the initiator (A).\n2. **Correspondence**: The protocol should ensure that the events `endBparam(x)` and `endBfull(x, y, z)` correspond to the events `beginBparam(x)` and `beginBfull(x, y, z)`, respectively.\n\n**Assumptions**\n\nThe protocol assumes that:\n\n1. The shared keys between A and S (kAS) and between B and S (kBS) are secret.\n2. The host identities are generated using a function `host/1` that takes a key as input.\n\n**ProVerif Model**\n\nThe ProVerif model of the WooLam protocol is provided in the given pi file. The model includes:\n\n1. **Functions**: `encrypt/2` and `decrypt/2` for symmetric encryption and decryption.\n2. **Host name/key**: `host/1` function to generate host identities.\n3. **Processes**: `processA`, `processB`, and `processS` to model the behavior of the initiator, responder, and server, respectively.\n4. **Queries**: Two queries to verify the correspondence between `endBparam(x)` and `beginBparam(x)`, and between `endBfull(x, y, z)` and `beginBfull(x, y, z)`.\n\nThe ProVerif output indicates that the protocol is vulnerable to an attack, as the queries are not satisfied."]]}, "PV-1/Skeme.pv": {"code": [[false, "To add notation to the given ProVerif code without changing the original code and ensuring that the added notations are semantically correct, we need to identify the parts of the protocol that we want to annotate and then use ProVerif's syntax for events and queries to verify certain properties.\n\nThe SKEME protocol is described in the given ProVerif code.

The protocol involves a series of message exchanges between the parties to establish the authenticity of the initiator and responder.\n\n**Protocol Participants:**\n\n1. **Initiator (A):** The party that initiates the authentication process.\n2. **Responder (B):** The party that responds to the initiator's authentication request.\n3. **Server (S):** A trusted third-party server that provides authentication services.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. The initiator (A) sends its identity to the responder (B).\n2. The responder (B) generates a nonce (N) and sends it to the initiator (A).\n3. The initiator (A) signs the nonce using its private key and sends the signed nonce to the responder (B).\n4. The responder (B) sends the initiator's identity to the server (S).\n5. The server (S) retrieves the public key associated with the initiator's identity from a key table and sends the initiator's identity along with its public key, signed by the server's private key, to the responder (B).\n6. The responder (B) verifies the signed message from the server and checks the signature on the nonce received from the initiator. If both verifications succeed, the responder considers the initiator authenticated.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n\nThe protocol is designed to achieve authentication between the initiator and responder. The security properties of interest include:\n\n* **Injective Agreement:** The protocol aims to ensure that the responder (B) agrees on the identity of the initiator (A) and the nonce (N) used in the authentication process.\n* **Secrecy:** The protocol assumes that the private keys of the honest participants (A, B, and S) are not compromised by an attacker.\n\n**ProVerif Analysis:**\n\nThe provided PV file models the Woo and Lam public-key authentication protocol using the ProVerif tool. The analysis results indicate that the protocol is vulnerable to an attack, and the injective agreement property is not satisfied. Specifically, the results show that the queries `inj-event(endBparam(x,y)) ==> inj-event(beginBparam(x,y))` and `inj-event(endBfull(x,y,z)) ==> inj-event(beginBfull(x,y,z))` are false, indicating that the protocol does not achieve injective agreement.\n\nBased on this description, you should be able to generate a corresponding PV file that can be run by ProVerif."]]}, "PV-1/Yahalom.pv": {"code": [[false, "To add notation to the given ProVerif code, we need to make sure that the original code remains unchanged and the added notations are semantically correct.

The protocol involves three parties: an initiator (A), a responder (B), and a server (S).\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. The initiator (A) sends a message to the responder (B) containing its identity and a nonce (Na).\n2. The responder (B) receives the message, generates a new nonce (Nb), and sends a message to the server (S) containing its identity, the initiator's identity, Na, and Nb, all encrypted with the shared key between B and S (Kbs).\n3. The server (S) receives the message, decrypts it, and generates a new session key (Kab). It then sends two messages: one to the initiator (A) containing the responder's identity, Kab, Na, and Nb, all encrypted with the shared key between A and S (Kas); and another to the responder (B) containing the initiator's identity and Kab, all encrypted with Kbs.\n4. The initiator (A) receives the message from the server, decrypts it, and sends a message to the responder (B) containing the encrypted message from the server (intended for B) and a new message containing Nb, encrypted with Kab.\n5. The responder (B) receives the message, decrypts the second part, and checks if it matches Nb. If it does, the protocol is considered successful.\n\n**PV File Components**\n\nThe PV file models the protocol using the following components:\n\n1. **Types and Functions**: The file defines types for keys, hosts, and nonces, as well as functions for encrypting and decrypting messages.\n2. **Secrecy Assumptions**: The file assumes that the shared keys between the hosts and the server (Kas and Kbs) are secret.\n3. **Roles**: The file defines three roles:\n\t* **Initiator** (processInitiator): models the behavior of the initiator (A).\n\t* **Responder** (processResponder): models the behavior of the responder (B).\n\t* **Server** (processS): models the behavior of the server (S).\n4. **Key Registration**: The file includes a process (processK) that allows the attacker to register new hosts and keys.\n5. **Start Process**: The file defines the start process, which initializes the keys, inserts the initial keys into the key table, and launches multiple sessions of the initiator, responder, server, and key registration processes.\n\n**Verification**\n\nThe PV file includes queries to verify the non-interference property for two secret values (secretA and secretB). The expected results are also provided.\n\nIf you would like me to generate a PV file based on a protocol description, please provide the description, and I will help you create a corresponding PV file that can be run by ProVerif."]]}, "PV-1/piyahalom.pi": {"code": [[false, "To add notation to the given pi language file without changing the original code and ensuring the final pi code file can be run by ProVerif, I will enhance the code with comments and additional events for better understanding and verification.

The goal is to establish a shared secret key `K_ab` between A and B, with the help of the server S.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. A initiates the protocol by sending its identity and a nonce `N_A` to B.\n2. B receives the message, generates a nonce `N_B`, and sends its identity, `N_B`, and an encrypted message containing A's identity and `N_A` (encrypted with the shared key `K_bs` between B and S) to S.\n3. S receives the message, decrypts it to obtain A's identity and `N_A`, generates a new session key `K_ab`, and sends a message to A containing `N_B`, an encrypted message for A (containing B's identity, `K_ab`, and `N_A`, encrypted with the shared key `K_as` between A and S), and an encrypted message for B (containing A's identity, `K_ab`, and `N_B`, encrypted with `K_bs`).\n4. A receives the message, decrypts it to obtain `K_ab` and verifies that the received `N_A` matches the original `N_A`. A then sends a message to B containing the encrypted message for B (received from S) and an encrypted `N_B` using `K_ab`.\n5. B receives the message, decrypts it to obtain `K_ab` and verifies that the received `N_B` matches the original `N_B`. If the verification succeeds, B and A have established a shared secret key `K_ab`.\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security properties:\n\n1. Secrecy of `secretA` and `secretB`: The protocol ensures that an attacker cannot obtain `secretA` and `secretB`, which are encrypted with the established session key `K_ab`.\n2. Authentication: The protocol ensures that A and B are authenticated to each other, and that the session key `K_ab` is correctly established.\n\n**Events and Queries**\n\nThe protocol uses several events to model the security properties:\n\n* `beginAparam(a)`: A begins the protocol with identity `a`.\n* `endAparam(a)`: A completes the protocol with identity `a`.\n* `beginBparam(b)`: B begins the protocol with identity `b`.\n* `endBparam(b)`: B completes the protocol with identity `b`.\n* `beginBkey(b, a, nb, kab)`: B establishes a session key `kab` with A.\n* `endBkey(b, a, nb, kab)`: B confirms the establishment of the session key `kab` with A.\n\nThe protocol verification queries check the following properties:\n\n1. Secrecy of `secretA` and `secretB`: `not attacker:secretA` and `not attacker:secretB`.\n2. Authentication: `evinj:endAparam(x) ==> evinj:beginAparam(x)`, `evinj:endBparam(x) ==> evinj:beginBparam(x)`, and `evinj:endBkey(x, y, z, t) ==> evinj:beginBkey(x, y, z, t)`.\n\nThese queries are used to verify the security properties of the protocol using the ProVerif tool."]]}, "PV-1/denning-sacco-orig.horntype": {"code": [[false, "To add notation to the given Horn clause language file without changing the original code and ensuring the final Horn type code file can be run by ProVerif, I'll provide the modified code.

It involves three main roles: Initiator, Responder, and Server. The protocol aims to establish a secure communication channel between two honest hosts (A and B) using a shared key.\n\n**Roles and Their Functions**\n\n1. **Initiator**: The initiator starts the protocol by sending a message to the responder. It generates a nonce (Na) and sends it along with its identity (xA) and the intended responder's identity (h) to the server. The initiator then receives a message from the server, decrypts it, and extracts the shared key (k) and other information.\n2. **Responder**: The responder receives a message from the initiator (via the attacker) and decrypts it using its shared key with the server (kbs). It generates a nonce (Nb) and responds to the initiator. The responder then receives another message from the initiator and verifies its contents.\n3. **Server**: The server receives a message from the initiator, retrieves the shared keys for the initiator and responder, generates a new shared key (k), and sends it to the initiator and responder.\n\n**Key Management**\n\nThe protocol uses a key table to store the shared keys between hosts and the server. The key table is populated by a separate process (processK) that receives host-key pairs from the attacker.\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe protocol is designed to achieve the following security properties:\n\n1. **Secrecy**: The protocol aims to keep the session secrets (secretA and secretB) confidential.\n2. **Authentication**: The protocol aims to ensure that the initiator and responder are authentic and that the messages they exchange are not tampered with.\n\n**Queries and Events**\n\nThe protocol defines several events and queries to verify its security properties. The events include:\n\n* beginAparam, endAparam, beginAkey, endAkey (related to the initiator)\n* beginBparam, endBparam, beginBkey, endBkey (related to the responder)\n\nThe queries check the secrecy of the session secrets and the authentication properties between the initiator and responder.\n\n**ProVerif Representation**\n\nThe PV file represents the protocol using the ProVerif language. It defines the roles, key management, and security properties using various constructs, including:\n\n* Processes (e.g., processInitiator, processResponder, processS)\n* Events and queries\n* Cryptographic primitives (e.g., encrypt, decrypt)\n* Tables (e.g., keys)\n\nOverall, the protocol is a complex system that involves multiple roles, key management, and security properties.

The protocol is designed to establish a secure communication between clients A and B.\n\n**Assumptions and Setup**\n\n* The protocol assumes a public channel `c` for communication between parties.\n* Each client has a private key (`skA` for A and `skB` for B) and a corresponding public key (`pkA` for A and `pkB` for B).\n* The key registration server and key retrieval server share a private key `skS` and a corresponding public key `pkS`.\n* The public keys of A, B, and the servers are initially registered in a table `keys`.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. **Key Registration**: The key registration server receives a host identity and a public key from a client. If the host is not A or B, the server inserts the public key into the `keys` table.\n2. **Key Retrieval**: When a client (say A) wants to communicate with another client (say B), it sends a request to the key retrieval server with the identities of A and B. The server retrieves B's public key from the `keys` table and sends it to A, signed with `skS`.\n3. **Client A's Initiation**: A initiates the protocol by generating a nonce `Na` and sending a request to the key retrieval server to obtain B's public key. Upon receiving the signed public key of B, A verifies the signature using `pkS`. A then sends an asymmetric encryption of `(Na, A)` to B using B's public key.\n4. **Client B's Response**: B receives the asymmetric encryption from A, decrypts it using its private key `skB`, and verifies that the identity in the message is A. B generates a nonce `Nb` and responds with an asymmetric encryption of `(Na, Nb, B)` to A using A's public key.\n5. **Client A's Response**: A receives the response from B, decrypts it using its private key `skA`, and verifies that the nonce `Na` is the same as the one it generated earlier. A then sends an asymmetric encryption of `Nb` to B using B's public key.\n6. **Client B's Confirmation**: B receives the response from A, decrypts it using its private key `skB`, and verifies that the nonce `Nb` is the same as the one it generated earlier. If the verification is successful, B outputs `objective`, indicating the successful completion of the protocol.\n\n**Security Goal**\n\nThe protocol aims to ensure the secrecy of the `objective` output by client B. The attacker is not supposed to be able to obtain `objective`.\n\n**ProVerif Modeling**\n\nThe PV file models the protocol using the applied pi-calculus. It defines the cryptographic primitives, the `keys` table, and the processes for the clients and servers. The `query` statement checks whether the attacker can obtain `objective`, indicating a potential security breach."]]}, "PV-1/piwoolampk.pi": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The protocol aims to authenticate the identity of A to B using public-key cryptography.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. **A initiates the protocol**: A sends its identity (`hostA`) to B.\n2. **B responds with a nonce**: B generates a fresh nonce (`n`) and sends it to A.\n3. **A signs the nonce and identities**: A signs a message containing its identity (`hostA`), B's identity (`hostB`), and the nonce (`n`) using its private key (`skA`). The signed message is sent to B.\n4. **B requests authentication from S**: B sends A's identity (`hostA`) to S.\n5. **S responds with A's public key**: S signs a message containing A's identity (`hostA`) and its public key (`pkA`) using its private key (`skS`).

The pi file models the following security properties:\n\n* `evinj:endBparam(x) ==> evinj:beginBparam(x)`: This query checks that if B completes the protocol with some parameter `x`, then A must have initiated the protocol with the same parameter `x`.\n* `evinj:endBfull(x,y,z) ==> evinj:beginBfull(x,y,z)`: This query checks that if B completes the protocol with parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`, then A must have initiated the protocol with the same parameters `x`, `y`, and `z`.\n\n**Assumptions**\n\nThe protocol assumes that the private keys (`skA`, `skB`, and `skS`) are secret and not compromised.\n\n**ProVerif Results**\n\nThe pi file includes the results of the ProVerif analysis, which indicate that both security properties are satisfied.\n\nBased on this description, you should be able to generate a corresponding pi file that can be run by ProVerif."]]}, "PV-1/rdp.pv": {"code": [[false, "The given ProVerif code is mostly well-structured.

The client wants to perform an operation on the affiliate, but the operation is subject to certain policies defined by the organization.\n\nThe protocol flow is as follows:\n\n1. The client sends a request to the RDP, which includes the client's name, the operation to be performed, and a nonce (a unique session identifier).\n2. The RDP forwards the client's name and nonce to the organization to retrieve the policy details.\n3. The organization checks if the client's name is authorized to perform the operation.

The affiliate checks if the operation is valid and if the RDP is authorized to perform the operation. If so, it returns a response to the RDP.\n6. The RDP forwards the response to the client.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n1. **Confidentiality of Client's Name**: The affiliate should not learn the client's name, regardless of whether the name is valid or invalid.\n2. **Correspondence between Client and Affiliate**: When the client receives a response, the organization should have seen the request before forwarding it to the affiliate.\n3. **Successful Execution**: When the client sends a request, it should receive a response.\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe protocol is analyzed using ProVerif, which checks the following security properties:\n\n1. **Secrecy**: The client's name remains secret from the attacker.\n2. **Correspondence**: The events `clientReceiveResponse`, `orgOK`, `rdpWasSuccessful`, and `affReceivesMsg` are correctly related, ensuring that the protocol executes as expected.\n\n**Entities and their Roles**\n\n1. **Client**: Sends a request to the RDP to perform an operation on the affiliate.\n2. **RDP**: Forwards the client's request to the organization and affiliate, and returns the response to the client.\n3. **Organization**: Defines policies and returns policy details to the RDP.\n4. **Affiliate**: Performs the operation and returns a response to the RDP.\n\nThe ProVerif code models the protocol and checks the security properties using queries.

The protocol uses symmetric key cryptography, where each party shares a secret key with the server.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. The initiator (A) sends its identity to the responder (B).\n2. The responder (B) generates a fresh nonce (N) and sends it to the initiator (A).\n3. The initiator (A) encrypts a message containing its identity, the responder's identity, and the nonce (N) using the key shared with the server (kAS) and sends it to the responder (B).\n4. The responder (B) encrypts the received message along with its own identity using the key shared with the server (kBS) and sends it to the server (S).\n5. The server (S) decrypts the received message, verifies the identities and the nonce, and responds with an encrypted message containing the initiator's identity, the responder's identity, and the nonce (N) using the key shared with the responder (kBS).\n6. The responder (B) verifies the received message from the server (S) by decrypting it and checking that it matches the expected values.\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe protocol is designed to achieve mutual authentication between the initiator and the responder. The security properties of the protocol are verified using the ProVerif tool, which checks for the following properties:\n\n* Injective correspondence between the `endBparam` and `beginBparam` events, ensuring that the responder's authentication is correctly linked to the initiator's initiation.\n* Injective correspondence between the `endBfull` and `beginBfull` events, ensuring that the responder's verification of the nonce is correctly linked to the initiator's generation of the nonce.\n\n**Assumptions**\n\nThe protocol assumes that the keys shared between the parties and the server are secret and securely distributed. The ProVerif model also assumes that the attacker cannot obtain the keys shared between the honest parties (A and B) and the server.\n\n**Key Takeaways**\n\nThe WooLam shared-key authentication protocol provides mutual authentication between two parties with the assistance of a trusted server. The protocol uses symmetric key cryptography and relies on the secrecy of the keys shared between the parties and the server. The ProVerif verification results indicate that the protocol satisfies the desired security properties."]]}}
