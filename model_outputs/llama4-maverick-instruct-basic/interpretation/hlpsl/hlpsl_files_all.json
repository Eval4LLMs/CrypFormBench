The protocol aims to establish a secure communication between OBU1 and OBU2, with the assistance of SN.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. OBU1 initiates the protocol by sending a message to SN, containing its identity (PID1), OBU2's identity (PID2), a freshly generated value (Q1), and a Message Authentication Code (MAC) computed using a hash function (H) over PID1, PID2, and Q1.\n2. SN verifies the received message and checks if the identities match the expected values. If valid, SN computes two values, R1 and R2, using two different Physically Unclonable Functions (PUF1 and PUF2) over two constants (C1 and C2). SN then computes R2en by XORing R1 and R2. SN sends a message to OBU2, containing PID1, C1, C2, R2en, Q1, and a hash value (Hs2) computed over C1, C2, R2en, PID1, R2, and Q1.\n3. OBU2 receives the message from SN and verifies the Hs2 value. If valid, OBU2 computes R2 using PUF2 over C2 and retrieves R1 by XORing R2en and R2. OBU2 generates a new value (A2) and computes Q2 using an exponential function over a public value (P) and A2. OBU2 sends a message to OBU1, containing C1, Q2, and a hash value (H21) computed over C1, R1, Q2, PID1, PID2, and Q1.\n4. OBU1 receives the message from OBU2 and verifies the H21 value. If valid, OBU1 computes a shared key (Key) using an exponential function over Q2 and its own secret value (A1). OBU1 computes a hash value (H12) over R1, PID1, PID2, Q2, and Key. OBU1 sends H12 to OBU2.\n5. OBU2 receives H12 from OBU1 and verifies its correctness. If valid, OBU2 confirms the authenticity of OBU1.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n* Secrecy of R1, R2, A1, and A2\n* Authentication between OBU1 and OBU2 (o1_o2_h12 and o2_o1_h21)\n* Authentication between SN and OBU2 (s_o2_hs2)\n\nThe HLPSL file models the protocol using three roles: role_OBU1, role_OBU2, and role_SN. The session role composes these three roles, and the environment role defines the constants and intruder knowledge.

The protocol involves two parties: a client (Alice) and a server (Bob).\n\n**Protocol Overview**\n\nThe protocol aims to provide secure communication between the client and server by establishing a shared secret key and authenticating the identities of both parties.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. **ClientHello**: The client (Alice) initiates the protocol by sending a `ClientHello` message to the server, which includes a nonce (`Na`), a session ID (`Sid`), and a random value (`Pa`).\n2. **ServerHello**: The server (Bob) responds with a `ServerHello` message, which includes a nonce (`Nb`), the session ID (`Sid`), and the client's random value (`Pa`). The server also sends its public key (`Kb`) encrypted with its private key (`inv(Ks)`).\n3. **ClientKeyExchange**: The client generates a pre-master secret (`PMS`) and sends it to the server encrypted with the server's public key (`Kb`). The client also sends its public key (`Ka`) encrypted with the server's private key (`inv(Ks)`), along with a signature of the server's nonce (`Nb`) and the pre-master secret (`PMS`) using the client's private key (`inv(Ka)`). Finally, the client sends a finished message (`Finished`) encrypted with the derived key (`KeyGen(A.Na.Nb'.PRF(PMS'.Na.Nb'))`).\n4. **ServerFinished**: The server verifies the client's finished message and responds with its own finished message (`Finished`) encrypted with the derived key (`KeyGen(B.Na.Nb.PRF(PMS'.Na.Nb))`).\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n1. **Secrecy**: The protocol ensures the secrecy of the client and server keys (`ClientK` and `ServerK`).\n2. **Authentication**: The protocol authenticates the identities of both the client and server using the nonces (`Na` and `Nb`) and the derived keys.\n\n**Intruder Model**\n\nThe protocol is analyzed under the Dolev-Yao intruder model, which assumes that the intruder can intercept, modify, and replay messages.\n\n**AVISPA HLPSL Code**\n\nThe provided HLPSL code models the protocol using two roles: `alice` and `bob`, which represent the client and server, respectively. The `session` role composes the two roles, and the `environment` role defines the intruder knowledge and the composition of multiple sessions.

The protocol is based on a Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. **Initiation**: Agent A initiates the protocol by generating a random number X and sending the value `exp(G, X)` to agent B, where G is a publicly known generator.\n2. **Response**: Agent B receives the value `exp(G, X)` and generates a random number Y. B sends the value `exp(G, Y)` to agent A.\n3. **Key Establishment**: Agent A receives `exp(G, Y)` and generates a new nonce N. A sends the encrypted nonce `{N}_exp(exp(G, X), Y)` to B, where the encryption key is derived from the Diffie-Hellman shared secret `exp(exp(G, X), Y)`.\n4. **Verification**: Agent B receives the encrypted nonce and verifies it. Although the hlpsl file does not explicitly show the verification step, it is implied that B can decrypt the nonce using the shared secret.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n1. **Secrecy of N**: The nonce N generated by A should remain secret between A and the intended party (in this case, A itself). This is represented by the `sec_1` protocol ID.\n2. **Secrecy of another unknown secret**: Although not directly related to the protocol steps, the HLPSL file also mentions `sec_2` as a protocol ID, which is not used in the protocol. It might be a leftover or a placeholder for another security goal.\n\n**Intruder Model**\n\nThe intruder is assumed to have the capability to intercept, modify, and replay messages (Dolev-Yao model), as indicated by the `channel(dy)` type in the HLPSL file. The intruder's initial knowledge includes the identities of agents A and B (`a` and `b`) and the public generator G (`f`).\n\n**AVISPA Modeling**\n\nThe HLPSL file models the protocol using two roles: `role_A` and `role_B`, representing agents A and B, respectively. The `session1` role composes the two agent roles, and the `environment` role sets up the initial knowledge and composition of the session.

The protocol involves two scenarios: normal access request and exceptional access request. However, the HLPSL file only models the normal access request scenario.\n\n**Protocol Participants**\n\n1. **Badge Reader (B)**: The badge reader is the initiator of the protocol. It is responsible for sending an access request to the server.\n2. **Server (S)**: The server receives the access request from the badge reader and responds accordingly.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. **Step 1: Access Request**\nThe badge reader (B) sends a request to the server (S) containing the badge reader's ID (`IdBadgeuse`) and the employee's ID (`IdEmploye`), encrypted with the server's public key (`PKs`).\n2. **Step 2: Server Response**\nThe server (S) receives the request and responds with an \"Ok\" message encrypted with the badge reader's public key (`PKb`).\n3. **Step 3: Badge Reader Acknowledgment**\nThe badge reader (B) receives the server's response and sends an \"Ok\" message back to the server, encrypted with the server's public key (`PKs`).\n\n**Security Properties**\nThe protocol aims to maintain the secrecy of the employee's ID (`IdEmploye`).\n\n**Intruder Model**\nThe intruder is assumed to have knowledge of the public keys of the badge reader (`PKb`) and the server (`PKs`), as well as its own public key (`PKi`) and private key (`inv(PKi)`). The intruder can participate in the protocol by playing the role of the server or the badge reader.\n\n**Session and Environment**\nThe protocol is modeled using two roles: `badgeuse` and `serveur`, which represent the badge reader and server, respectively. The `session` role composes these two roles to model a single session. The `environment` role defines the overall scenario, including multiple sessions between the badge reader and the server, as well as between the badge reader and the intruder.\n\nThis description should allow you to generate a corresponding HLPSL file that can be run by AVISPA.

The protocol uses symmetric encryption and public-key cryptography to achieve mutual authentication and key exchange.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. Alice initiates the protocol by sending a message containing her public key, encrypted with the shared symmetric key `Kab`, to Bob.\n2. Bob responds with a message containing the shared secret key `K`, encrypted with Alice's public key and then with the shared symmetric key `Kab`.\n3. Alice sends a challenge message, encrypted with the shared secret key `K`, to Bob.\n4. Bob responds with a challenge-response message, containing both the challenge received from Alice and a new challenge, encrypted with the shared secret key `K`.\n5. Alice verifies the challenge-response message and sends a response to Bob's challenge, encrypted with the shared secret key `K`.\n6. Bob verifies the response and completes the protocol.\n\n**Security Goals:**\n\n1. **Confidentiality**: The protocol aims to maintain the confidentiality of the shared secret key `K`.\n2. **Mutual Authentication**: The protocol ensures mutual authentication between Alice and Bob using the challenge-response mechanism.\n\n**Attack Scenario:**\n\nA man-in-the-middle attack is possible, where an intruder can intercept and manipulate the messages between Alice and Bob. However, the protocol is designed to prevent the exposure of secret nonces.\n\nThe HLPSL file models the EKE protocol using two roles: `eke_Init` (Alice) and `eke_Resp` (Bob). The `session` role composes the two roles, and the `environment` role defines the initial knowledge of the intruder and the composition of multiple sessions. The `goal` section specifies the security goals, including confidentiality and mutual authentication.\n\nUsing this description, one should be able to generate a corresponding HLPSL file that can be run by the AVISPA tool."]]}, "HLPSL-1/h.530.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: H.530: Symmetric security procedures for H.323 mobility in H.510\n%% VARIANT: Original version\n%% PURPOSE: Establish an authenticated (Diffie-Hellman) shared-key\n%% between a mobile terminal (MT) and a visited gate-keeper (VGK), who do not\n%% know each other in advance, but who have a \"mutual friend\", an \n%% authentication facility (AuF) in the home domain of MT. \n%%\n%% REFERENCE: \\url{http://www.itu.int/rec/recommendation.asp?type=folders&lang=e&parent=T-REC-H.530} \\\\\n%% (original version without \"corrigendum\")\n%% MODELER: Sebastian M\\\"odersheim, ETH Z\\\"urich, 2004\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%%  Macros\n%%  M1 = MT,VGK,NIL,CH1,exp(G,X)\n%%  M2 = M1,F(ZZ,M1),VGK,exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y)\n%%  M3 = VGK,MT,F(ZZ,VGK),F(ZZ,exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y))\n%%  M4 = VGK,MT,CH1,CH2,exp(G,Y),F(ZZ,exp(G,X) XOR exp(G,Y)),F(ZZ,VGK)\n%%  M5 = MT,VGK,CH2,CH3\n%%  M6 = VGK,MT,CH3,CH4\n%%-------------------------------------------------------------------\n%%  1.

I have added comments to the original code to explain what each part is doing. The code remains semantically correct. \n\nThe code is between ```hlpsl and ``` as required."]], "logic": [[true, "Based on the provided HLPSL file, I will generate a description of the protocol.\n\n**Protocol Description:**\nThe H.530 protocol is a symmetric security procedure for H.323 mobility in H.510. It aims to establish an authenticated shared key between a mobile terminal (MT) and a visited gate-keeper (VGK) with the help of an authentication facility (AuF) in the home domain of MT.\n\n**Protocol Participants:**\n\n1. Mobile Terminal (MT)\n2. Visited Gate-Keeper (VGK)\n3. Authentication Facility (AuF)\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. MT initiates the protocol by sending a message to VGK containing its identity, VGK's identity, a nonce (CH1), and a Diffie-Hellman public value (exp(G,X)).\n2. VGK receives the message, generates a new Diffie-Hellman private value (Y), and computes the shared key (exp(GX',Y')). VGK then sends a message to AuF containing the received message from MT, its own identity, and the XOR of the received Diffie-Hellman public value and its own Diffie-Hellman public value.\n3. AuF receives the message, verifies the authenticity of the message, and sends a response to VGK containing VGK's identity, MT's identity, and a hashed value of the XOR of the received Diffie-Hellman public values.\n4. VGK receives the response from AuF, generates a new nonce (CH2), and sends a message to MT containing the received nonce (CH1), the new nonce (CH2), its own Diffie-Hellman public value, and hashed values of the shared key and other protocol data.\n5. MT receives the message, verifies the authenticity of the message, computes the shared key, and sends a response to VGK containing the received nonce (CH2) and a new nonce (CH3).\n6. VGK receives the response from MT, verifies the authenticity of the message, and sends a final message to MT containing the received nonce (CH3) and a new nonce (CH4).\n\n**Security Goals:**\n\n1. Entity authentication (G1)\n2. Message authentication (G2)\n3. Replay protection (G3)\n4. Authorization (by T3P) (G6)\n5. Key authentication (G7)\n\n**Security Properties:**\n\n1. Secrecy of the shared key (sec_m_Key and sec_v_Key)\n\nThe protocol uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a shared key between MT and VGK. The AuF plays a crucial role in authenticating the parties and ensuring the integrity of the protocol data. The protocol is designed to provide entity authentication, message authentication, replay protection, and key authentication.\n\nThis description should be sufficient to generate a corresponding HLPSL file that can be run by AVISPA."]]}, "HLPSL-1/IKEv2-DS.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: IKEv2: Internet Key Exchange, version 2\n%% VARIANT: authentication based on digital signatures\n%% PURPOSE:\n%% IKE is designed to perform mutual authentication and key\n%% exchange prior to setting up an IPsec connection.\n%%\n%% IKEv2 exists in several variants, the defining difference\n%% being the authentication method used.  \n%%\n%% This variant, which we call IKEv2-DS, uses digital signatures.\n%%\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\cite{ipsec-ikev2}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%% \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\item Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% IKEv2-DS proceeds in two so-called exchanges.

He generates a fresh nonce `Nb` and sends `Na` along with `Nb`, encrypted with Alice's public key `Ka`.\n\n3. **A \u2192 B:** `{Nb}_Kb`\n   - Alice decrypts the second message to obtain `Na` and `Nb`. She verifies that the received `Na` matches the one she sent earlier. Then, she sends `Nb` encrypted with Bob's public key `Kb`.\n\n**Security Goals:**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve secrecy of the nonces `Na` and `Nb`, which are considered secret data. Specifically, the protocol ensures that:\n\n- `Na` remains secret between A and B (`secret_na`).\n- `Nb` remains secret between A and B (`secret_nb`).\n\n**Intruder Model:**\n\nThe HLPSL file models a Dolev-Yao intruder, who has the capability to intercept, modify, and send new messages.

The `environment()` role sets up multiple sessions of the protocol, including sessions between honest agents (`a` and `b`) and sessions involving the intruder (`i`).

The protocol is designed to achieve mutual authentication between A and B.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. **A initiates the protocol**: A generates a fresh nonce Na and sends it to B.\n2. **B responds**: B receives Na and sends back the XOR of Na and the shared secret S (i.e., xor(Na, S)) to A.\n3. **A verifies B's response**: A receives the response from B and checks if it is indeed the XOR of Na and S. If so, A is assured that B is authentic.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n1. **Secrecy of S**: The shared secret S should remain confidential between A and B.\n2. **Authentication of B to A**: A should be assured that B is authentic and has access to the shared secret S.\n\n**Protocol Analysis**\n\nThe HLPSL file models two sessions of the protocol between agents A (Alice) and B (Bob), who share a secret S (s1). The intruder knowledge is limited to the identities of Alice and Bob.\n\nThe protocol is analyzed for the following security properties:\n\n1. **Secrecy of sec_1**: The protocol should maintain the secrecy of the shared secret S (sec_1).\n2. **Authentication of auth_1**: The protocol should ensure that A is assured of B's authenticity (auth_1).\n\nThe HLPSL file is well-formed, and the protocol description can be reverse-engineered from it.

Define the roles of A and B, including their local variables, initial state, and transitions.\n2. Define the session role, which composes the roles of A and B.\n3.

The protocol consists of two phases: registration and mutual authentication and key exchange.\n\n**Registration Phase**\n\n1. The user (U) initiates the registration process by sending a registration request to the server (S).\n2. U generates a random value `SPWim` and computes `SAim = xor(H(SPWim), H(Ri.SIDim))`, where `Ri` and `SIDim` are pre-shared values.\n3. U sends `{SIDim, SAim}_Kus` to S, where `Kus` is a symmetric key shared between U and S.\n4. S receives the registration request and computes `Umi = H(SIDim.Xm)` and `Bmi = xor(Umi, xor(H(SPWim), H(Ri.SIDim)))`.\n5. S sends `{Bmi}_Kus` to U.\n6. U receives the response and stores `Bmi` in its flash storage.\n\n**Mutual Authentication and Key Exchange Phase**\n\n1. U initiates the mutual authentication and key exchange process by sending a request to F.\n2. U computes `Uim = xor(Bmi, SAim)`, generates a random value `Aim`, and computes `Cim1 = {xor((Uim.SIDim), Tim)}_Ks`, where `Tim` is a timestamp and `Ks` is a public key of S.\n3. U sends `Cim1` and `Tim` to F.\n4. F receives the request, generates random values `Nfp` and `Nfp1`, and computes `Qp = xor(Nfp, Nfp1)` and `Bpm = {Qp, Nfp1}_Kas`, where `Kas` is a symmetric key shared between F and S.\n5. F sends `xor(Cim1, Nfp)`, `Cim1`, and `Bpm` to S.\n6. S receives the request, verifies the identity of U, and computes `B1mi`, `Wmi`, `Ymi`, and `Kmi`.\n7. S sends `{{Wmi, Kmi, B2mi, Nfp, Nfp1}_Rus}_Kas` to F, where `Rus` is a symmetric key shared between S and U.\n8. F receives the response and sends `{Wmi, Kmi, B2mi, Nfp, Nfp1}_Rus` and `Qp` to U.\n9. U receives the response, verifies the identity of S, and computes the shared key `Kua`.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n1. Secrecy of `g1`, `g2`, `g3`, `g4`, `g5`, and `g6`, which represent various secret values exchanged during the protocol.\n2. Authentication of U and S on the timestamp `Tim` and the random value `B1mi`.\n\nThe HLPSL file models the protocol using three roles: `user`, `server`, and `foreign`, which correspond to U, S, and F, respectively. The `session` role composes the three roles to model a single session of the protocol. The `environment` role models the intruder's knowledge and capabilities. The `goal` section specifies the security goals to be verified."]]}, "HLPSL-1/An_Autonomous_Log_Storage_Management_Protocol_with_Blockchain_Mechanism_and_Access_Control_for_the_Internet_of_Things.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "% User role definition\nrole user (A, S, U: agent, Kau: symmetric_key, ECDSA: public_key, H, Add, Mul, Pair: hash_func, SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by U def=\n  % Local variables for the user role\n  local State: nat,\n  IDi, TIDi, Ys, Alpha, SK, Ss, Ce, C, Hs, Sig, G, M, Y, X, IP, T: text\n  % Initial state\n  init State := 0\n  transition\n    % User registration phase\n    1.

It computes a secret key `SK` using `G`, `Alpha`, and `TIDi`, where `G` is a generator.\n\t* The Authority sends the computed `SK` encrypted with `Kau` to the User.\n\t* The User receives the `SK` and stores it.\n2. **Log Signcryption Phase**\n\t* The Sensor initiates the log signcryption process by generating a random `Ss` and computing `Ce = G^Ss`, `C = M * Y^Ss`, and `X = (H(C) * Y * Ss)^Hs`, where `M` is the log data, `Y` is a public value, and `H` is a hash function.\n\t* The Sensor computes a signature `Sig = {X, IP, T}_inv(ECDSA)`, where `IP` is the IP address of the Sensor, `T` is a timestamp, and `ECDSA` is a public key.\n\t* The Sensor sends `Ce`, `C`, and `Sig` to the User.\n3. **Log Unsigncryption Phase**\n\t* The User receives `Ce`, `C`, and `Sig` from the Sensor and verifies the signature using the `ECDSA` public key.\n\t* The User computes `Ys = Pair(SK, Ce)` and uses it to decrypt `C` to obtain the log data `M`.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n1. **Secrecy**: The protocol ensures the secrecy of `idi`, `sk`, `alpha`, and `ss`.\n2. **Authentication**: The protocol ensures the authentication of `ss` between the Sensor and the User.\n\n**Intruder Model**\n\nThe intruder is assumed to have the following capabilities:\n\n* The intruder knows the public values `a`, `s`, `u`, `ki`, and `inv(ki)`.\n* The intruder can participate in the protocol by playing the role of the User, Authority, or Sensor.\n\nThe HLPSL file models the protocol using the Dolev-Yao intruder model, which assumes that the intruder can intercept, modify, and replay messages.

The protocol consists of two phases: registration and mutual authentication.\n\n**Registration Phase**\n\n1. The user initiates the registration process by sending a message to the server, which includes the user's identity (IDi), a freshly generated random number (Aii), and other parameters, all encrypted with a symmetric key (Kus) shared between the user and the server.\n2. The server receives the message, computes some values (Ui, Uj, Bii, and Bjj), and sends a response back to the user, which includes Bii and Bjj, encrypted with the same symmetric key (Kus).\n3. Both the user and the server store some secret values (IDi, Ai, PWi, Bii, and Bjj) for later use.\n\n**Mutual Authentication Phase**\n\n1. The user inputs their identity (IDi), the server's identity (SIDj), and their password (PWi) into a smart card, which checks the password.\n2. The smart card computes some values (Ui, Ki, Ri, Pi, Mi, Bi, and Ci) and sends a message to the server, which includes Ri and Ci.\n3. The server receives the message, computes some values (Ki, Mi, Sj, Wj, Kij, and MacSj), and sends a response back to the user, which includes MacSj and Wj.\n4. The user receives the response, computes some values (Kij and MacUi), and sends a final message to the server, which includes MacUi.\n5. The server verifies the received MacUi and completes the authentication process.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n1. Secrecy of certain values (IDi, Ai, PWi, Bii, Bjj, and Xsj).\n2. Mutual authentication between the user and the server, ensuring that both parties are aware of the other's identity and the session parameters (Pi and Sj).\n\nThe HLPSL file models the protocol using two roles: user and server.

The protocol is described in RFC 3118.\n\n**Protocol Overview**\n\nThe protocol involves two entities: a client (C) and a server (S). The client initiates the protocol by sending a request to the server, which responds with a message that includes authentication information.\n\n**Message Flow**\n\nThe protocol consists of two messages:\n\n1. C \u2192 S: `C, delayedAuthReq, Time1`\n\t* The client sends a request to the server, including its identity, a request for delayed authentication, and a fresh nonce (`Time1`).\n2. S \u2192 C: `S, delayedAuthReq, succ(Time1), KeyID(K), H(S, delayedAuthReq, succ(Time1), K)`\n\t* The server responds with its identity, a delayed authentication request, the successor of the client's nonce (`succ(Time1)`), a key identifier (`KeyID(K)`), and a hash (`H`) of the server's identity, the delayed authentication request, the successor of the client's nonce, and the shared secret key (`K`).\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n* **G1, G2, G3**: Authentication of the server to the client.\n* **G12**: Secrecy of the shared secret key (`K`).\n\n**Protocol Analysis**\n\nThe HLPSL file models the protocol using two roles: `dhcp_Delayed_Client` and `dhcp_Delayed_Server`. The client initiates the protocol, and the server responds with the authentication information. The protocol is analyzed using the AVISPA tool to verify its security properties.\n\n**Assumptions and Limitations**\n\nThe HLPSL file notes the following assumptions and limitations:\n\n* The protocol is a simplified version of the RFC 3118, focusing only on the MUST checks.\n* The length field is ignored, as it cannot be expressed in HLPSL.\n* A fresh nonce is used to model the Replay Detection Mechanism (RDM).\n* The 'DelayedAuthReq' token is assumed to specify the algorithm, type of authentication, and type of RDM.\n\nOverall, the DHCP-Delayed-Auth protocol provides a mechanism for delayed entity and message authentication in DHCP, and the HLPSL file provides a formal model of the protocol for analysis using the AVISPA tool."]]}, "HLPSL-1/Three-factor_fast_authentication_scheme_for_e-health_systems_in_5G_wireless_sensor_network.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "% User Role: Defines the user's behavior in the protocol.\nrole user (U, S: agent, Kus, SKij: symmetric_key, Ks: public_key, H, H1, H2, H6, H7, H14, H16: hash_func, SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by U def=\n\n  % Local variables used by the user.\n  local State: nat,\n        IDi, IDinew, IDj, Nj, PWi, Bi, E, Ej, Xj, V, N, N1, BBi, W, Yij, Tu, Ts, T1, T2, A, As, B, Bs, SKijNew: text, K, Q, Ay, By: message\n\n  % Initial state of the user.\n  init State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n  % Registration Phase: User initiates registration with the server.\n  % Step 1: User sends registration request to the server.\n\t1.

The protocol consists of three phases: Registration, Login and Initial Authentication, and Fast Authentication.\n\n**Registration Phase**\n\n1. The user (U) initiates the registration process by sending a message to the server (S) containing their identity (IDi), a hashed value (W') computed using their password (PWi), biometric data (Bi), and a random value (E'). The message is encrypted using a symmetric key (Kus) shared between U and S.\n2. The server (S) receives the message, computes a value (Yij') using the received data and a secret value (Xj), and stores IDj. S then sends a response to U containing IDi, a nonce (Nj), and Yij', encrypted using Kus.\n\n**Login and Initial Authentication Phase**\n\n1. The user (U) initiates the login process by sending a message to the server (S) containing their identity (IDi), IDj, a hashed value (Yij'), a nonce (N'), and a timestamp (Tu'). The message is encrypted using the server's public key (Ks).\n2. The server (S) receives the message, verifies the contents, and computes a session key (SKij') using the received nonce (N') and Yij'. S then sends a response to U containing a value (B'), IDinew', and timestamps (T1' and T2'), encrypted using SKij'.\n\n**Fast Authentication Phase**\n\n1. The user (U) sends a message to the server (S) containing a hashed value (Ay') computed using previously exchanged data.\n2. The server (S) receives the message, verifies the contents, and computes a response (By') using the session key (SKij'). S then sends By' to U.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n1. Secrecy of certain values (g1, g2, g3, g4, g5, g6, g7)\n2. Authentication between U and S on certain values (u_s_v, u_s_tu, s_u_ts)\n\nThe HLPSL file models the protocol using two main roles: `user` and `server`. The `session` role composes the `user` and `server` roles, and the `environment` role defines the intruder knowledge and the composition of multiple sessions. The `goal` section specifies the security goals to be verified.\n\nThis description should allow you to generate a corresponding HLPSL file that can be run by AVISPA."]]}, "HLPSL-1/SPEKE.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL*: SPEKE\n%% VARIANT: SPEKE (with strong password-only authentication)\n%% PURPOSE: Strong Password-Only Authenticated Key Exchange\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\url{http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/jablon96strong.html}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%%  \\item Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n%%  \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%% A -> B : exp(S(A,B), Na)     |    key exchange part\n%% B -> A : exp(S(A,B), Nb)     |\n%%\n%%               both A and B compute\n%%               K = exp(exp(S(A,B),Na), Nb) = exp(exp(S(A,B),Nb), Na)\n%%\n%% A -> B : {Ca}_K              |\n%% B -> A : {Cb,Ca}_K           |    challenge/response\n%% A -> B : {Cb}_K              |    authentication part\n%%\n%% S(A,B): password (shared key)\n%% \\end{verbatim}\n%%\n%% LIMITATIONS: None\n%%\n%% PROBLEMS: 3\n%%\n%% CLASSIFICATION: G2 G12\n%%\n%% ATTACKS: None\n%% NOTES: None\n%%\t\n%%HLPSL:\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%% Role for the Initiator (A) in the SPEKE protocol\nrole speke_Init (A,B: agent,\n                 Kab: symmetric_key,  %% Shared password/key between A and B\n                 Snd,Rcv: channel(dy))  %% Channels for sending and receiving with Dolev-Yao model\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n  %% Local variables for the initiator role\n  local  State: nat,  %% State variable to track the current state of the protocol\n         Na,Ca: text,  %% Nonce and challenge generated by A\n         Cb   : text,  %% Challenge received from B\n         X,K  : message  %% Received message and computed shared key\n\n  %% Constants for protocol identifiers related to the secrecy of Ca and Cb\n  const  sec_i_Ca, sec_i_Cb : protocol_id\n\n  %% Initial state\n  init   State := 0\n\n  %% Transition rules defining the protocol steps for the initiator\n  transition\n\n   %% Step 1: A sends exp(S(A,B), Na) to B upon receiving start signal\n   1.

The protocol is designed to provide strong password-only authentication, meaning that the only secret information shared between the parties is a password.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Key Exchange:**\n\t* Alice (A) generates a random nonce `Na` and computes `exp(S(A,B), Na)`, where `S(A,B)` is the shared password between A and B. She sends this value to Bob (B).\n\t* Bob (B) generates a random nonce `Nb` and computes `exp(S(A,B), Nb)`. He sends this value to Alice (A).\n\t* Both parties compute the shared secret key `K = exp(exp(S(A,B), Na), Nb) = exp(exp(S(A,B), Nb), Na)`.\n2. **Challenge/Response and Authentication:**\n\t* Alice (A) generates a random challenge `Ca` and encrypts it with the shared key `K`. She sends the encrypted challenge `{Ca}_K` to Bob (B).\n\t* Bob (B) decrypts the challenge and generates a random challenge `Cb`. He encrypts both `Cb` and `Ca` with the shared key `K` and sends the encrypted challenges `{Cb.Ca}_K` to Alice (A).\n\t* Alice (A) decrypts the challenges and verifies that `Ca` is correct. She then encrypts `Cb` with the shared key `K` and sends the encrypted challenge `{Cb}_K` to Bob (B).\n\t* Bob (B) decrypts the challenge and verifies that `Cb` is correct.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n\n* **Confidentiality:** The protocol aims to maintain the confidentiality of the challenges `Ca` and `Cb`.\n* **Message Authentication:** The protocol aims to ensure that the challenges `Ca` and `Cb` are authentic and come from the intended parties.\n\n**Limitations and Assumptions:**\n\n* The protocol assumes that the shared password `S(A,B)` is strong and not easily guessable by an attacker.\n* The protocol does not have any explicit limitations mentioned in the HLPSL file.\n\n**Attack Scenarios:**\n\n* The HLPSL file does not mention any specific attack scenarios. However, the protocol is designed to be secure against passive and active attacks, including eavesdropping, replay attacks, and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThe provided HLPSL file models the SPEKE protocol using two roles: `speke_Init` (played by Alice) and `speke_Resp` (played by Bob). The file also defines a `session` role that composes the two roles and an `environment` role that sets up multiple sessions between honest and dishonest parties.

The protocol is initiated by the server, which sends a challenge to the client. The client responds with its digital signature, which is verified by the server.\n\n**Protocol Steps**\n\n1. The server (B) initiates the protocol by sending a random number (Rb) and a text message (Text1) to the client (A).\n2. The client (A) responds by sending its public key (Pka), its identity (A), and a certificate ({Pka,A}inv(PKs)) issued by the server's private key (Pks). The client also sends a random number (Ra), the server's random number (Rb), the server's identity (B), and a text message (Text2). Additionally, the client sends a digital signature ({Ra,Rb,B,Text1}inv(PKa)) of the server's random number, its own random number, the server's identity, and the original text message (Text1) sent by the server.\n\n**Security Goals**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve unilateral authentication of the client to the server. The server verifies the client's identity by checking the digital signature sent in the second message.\n\n**Attack Scenarios**\n\nThe HLPSL file models three different sessions:\n\n1. A legitimate session between the client (a) and the server (b).\n2. A session between the client (a) and an intruder (i) impersonating the server.\n3. A session between the intruder (i) impersonating the client and the server (b).\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe protocol is analyzed for authentication properties using the Avispa tool. The goal is to verify that the server (B) authenticates the client (A) on the random number (Ra) generated by the client.\n\nBased on this description, one should be able to generate a corresponding HLPSL file that can be run by Avispa."]]}, "HLPSL-1/Kerberos.hlpsl": {"code": [[false, "To keep the original code unchanged and add notations that are semantically correct, we can add comments to explain what each part of the code is doing.

The protocol involves four main entities:\n\n1. **Client (C):** The entity that requests access to a service or resource.\n2. **Authentication Server (A):** The entity responsible for authenticating the client and issuing a ticket-granting ticket.\n3. **Ticket Granting Server (G):** The entity that issues service tickets to the client based on the ticket-granting ticket obtained from the authentication server.\n4. **Server (S):** The entity that provides the service or resource requested by the client.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\nThe Kerberos protocol involves the following steps:\n\n1. **Client requests a ticket-granting ticket:** The client sends a request to the authentication server, including its identity, the identity of the ticket granting server, a lifetime value, and a nonce.\n2. **Authentication Server responds with a ticket-granting ticket:** The authentication server generates a ticket-granting ticket, encrypts it with the shared key between the authentication server and the ticket granting server, and sends it to the client along with a encrypted response containing the session key, ticket granting server's identity, and other relevant information.\n3. **Client requests a service ticket:** The client uses the ticket-granting ticket to request a service ticket from the ticket granting server, including the identity of the server, a lifetime value, a nonce, and the ticket-granting ticket.\n4. **Ticket Granting Server responds with a service ticket:** The ticket granting server generates a service ticket, encrypts it with the shared key between the ticket granting server and the server, and sends it to the client along with an encrypted response containing the session key, server's identity, and other relevant information.\n5. **Client authenticates to the server:** The client uses the service ticket to authenticate to the server, including the service ticket and an encrypted authenticator.\n6. **Server responds with a confirmation:** The server verifies the client's identity and responds with a confirmation, encrypted with the session key.\n\n**Security Goals:**\n\nThe Kerberos protocol aims to achieve the following security goals:\n\n* **Authentication:** The client is authenticated to the server.\n* **Key Exchange:** A secure session key is established between the client and the server.\n* **Secrecy:** The session keys and other sensitive information are kept confidential.\n\n**Limitations and Assumptions:**\n\nThe HLPSL file mentions that ticket caching is not performed, which may lead to weak authentication. Additionally, the protocol assumes that the initial shared keys between the entities are securely established.\n\nThis description should be sufficient to generate a corresponding HLPSL file that can be run by AVISPA."]]}}
