The resulting ciphertext `c1` is sent to the responder.\n2. **Responder's Response**: The responder decrypts `c1` using their private key `~lkR` to obtain `m1`. The responder generates a random nonce `nonceB` and computes a shared secret key `key` using the Key Derivation Function (KDF) with inputs `m1`, `I`, `R`, `nonceB`, and `c1`.

It aims to provide authentication and key exchange between two parties, traditionally referred to as Alice (A) and Bob (B).\n\n**Protocol Overview**\n\n1. **Asymmetric Key Setup**: The protocol begins with the setup of asymmetric keys for both Alice and Bob. Each party generates a private key and a corresponding public key.\n2. **Public Key Exchange**: The public keys of Alice and Bob are exchanged and made available to each other.\n3. **Initiation**: Once the public keys are exchanged, the protocol is initiated. Both Alice and Bob are initialized with their respective private keys, public keys, and the public key of the other party.\n\n**Protocol Flow**\n\n1. **Alice's First Message**: Alice generates a random number `x` and computes `g^x`, where `g` is a generator of a multiplicative group. She signs the message `<'One', A, B, g^x>` with her private key and sends it to Bob.\n2. **Bob's Response**: Upon receiving Alice's message, Bob verifies the signature using Alice's public key. If the verification is successful, Bob generates a random number `y` and computes `g^y`. He signs the message `<'Two', B, A, g^y>` with his private key and sends it to Alice. Bob also computes the shared secret key `g^(xy)`.\n3. **Alice's Response**: Upon receiving Bob's message, Alice verifies the signature using Bob's public key. If the verification is successful, Alice computes the shared secret key `g^(xy)`.\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security properties:\n\n* **Key Secrecy**: The shared secret key `g^(xy)` remains secret and is not known to any adversary.\n* **Authentication**: The protocol ensures that Alice and Bob are authenticated to each other.\n\n**Tamarin Prover Model**\n\nThe given spthy file models the Signed Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange protocol using the Tamarin Prover.

The master secret is used to derive two session keys: the client key (Ckey) and the server key (Skey).\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe TLS Handshake protocol is designed to provide the following security properties:\n\n* **Session Key Secrecy**: The session keys established between the client and server remain secret and are not compromised by an adversary.\n* **Injective Agreement**: The client and server agree on the session parameters, and the protocol ensures that there is a unique session established between the client and server.\n* **Session Key Setup**: The protocol allows for the setup of session keys between honest agents.\n\nOverall, the TLS Handshake protocol provides a secure key exchange mechanism between a client and a server, ensuring the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged between them.\n\nThis description should be sufficient to generate the corresponding SPTHY file.
