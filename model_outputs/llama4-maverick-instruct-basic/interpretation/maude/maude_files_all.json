The protocol involves five messages exchanged between Alice, Bob, and a trusted server.\n\n**Protocol Participants**\n\n* Alice (A): an initiator who wants to authenticate with Bob\n* Bob (B): a responder who wants to authenticate with Alice\n* Server (S): a trusted third-party server who facilitates the authentication process\n\n**Protocol Messages**\n\n1. Alice -> Bob: A, Na (Alice's identity and a nonce)\n2. Bob -> Server: A, Na, B, Nb (Bob's identity and a nonce)\n3. Server -> Bob: E(Kbs, Nb, Kab, A), E(Kas, Na, Kab, B) (encrypted messages containing the session key and identities)\n4. Bob -> Alice: E(Kas, Na, Kab, B), E(Kab, Nb, Na) (encrypted messages containing the session key and nonces)\n5. Alice -> Bob: E(Kab, Na, Nb) (encrypted message containing the nonces)\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\nThe protocol begins with Alice sending a message to Bob containing her identity and a nonce (Na). Bob responds by sending a message to the Server containing Alice's identity, her nonce, his identity, and his own nonce (Nb). The Server generates a session key (Kab) and sends two encrypted messages to Bob: one containing the session key, Bob's nonce, and Alice's identity, encrypted with the shared key between Bob and the Server (Kbs); and another containing the session key, Alice's nonce, and Bob's identity, encrypted with the shared key between Alice and the Server (Kas).\n\nBob decrypts the messages and verifies the contents. He then sends two encrypted messages to Alice: one containing the session key, Alice's nonce, and Bob's identity, encrypted with the shared key between Alice and the Server (Kas); and another containing the session key, Bob's nonce, and Alice's nonce, encrypted with the session key (Kab).\n\nAlice decrypts the messages and verifies the contents. She then sends an encrypted message to Bob containing Alice's nonce and Bob's nonce, encrypted with the session key (Kab).\n\n**Security Properties**\n\nThe protocol is designed to provide mutual authentication between Alice and Bob, as well as establish a shared session key. The protocol is also designed to be resistant to certain types of attacks, such as replay attacks and man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\n**Attack Scenarios**\n\nThe Maude file defines several attack scenarios, including:\n\n* An execution where the intruder finds out the session key generated by the Server\n* An execution where Bob completes the protocol believing that he is talking to Alice, but it is not so\n\nThese attack scenarios are used to test the security properties of the protocol using the Maude-NPA tool.\n\nBased on this description, you should be able to generate a corresponding Maude file that can be run by Maude-NPA."]]}, "MAUDE-1/Otway-Rees.maude": {"code": [[false, "To add notation to the given Maude file without changing the original code and ensuring the final Maude code file can be run by Maude-NPA, I'll identify the necessary modifications.

The protocol consists of a single node `N` that performs an assignment operation.\n\n**Node N**\n\nNode `N` has a single variable `x` initialized to `v(0)`, which is a value of type `0`. The node is in a `waiting` state and has several attributes:\n\n* `startc`, `endc`, `inv`, `post`, and `pre` are all set to `const(v(true))`, indicating that the node has no specific start or end conditions, and its invariant, postcondition, and precondition are all true.\n* `repeatc` is set to `const(v(false))`, indicating that the node does not repeat its execution.\n* `skip` is set to `const(v(false))`, indicating that the node does not skip its execution.\n* `priority` is set to `1`, indicating the node's priority.\n\n**Assignment Operation**\n\nThe node `N` performs an assignment operation that sets the value of `x` to the result of a `LookUpNow` operation on variable `X`. The `LookUpNow` operation evaluates to the current value of `X`, which is `v(1)` according to the environment definition `Example1Env`.\n\n**Environment**\n\nThe environment is defined by `Example1Env`, which sets the initial value of variable `X` to `v(1)`.\n\n**Initial State**\n\nThe initial state of the system is defined by `stateN`, which includes:\n\n* An empty context list (`nilcontexts`)\n* A global configuration with variable `X` having value `v(1)`\n* A node `N` in state `waiting` with the attributes mentioned earlier\n* A memory cell for variable `x` of node `N` with initial value `v(0)`\n\n**Execution**\n\nThe execution of the protocol is simulated using the `srew` command, which applies the `micro` rewrite rule to the initial state `stateN`.\n\nBased on this description, one should be able to generate a corresponding Maude file that can be run by Maude-NPA."]]}, "MAUDE-1/multiset-algebra.maude": {"code": [[false, "The provided Maude file defines a multiset algebra.
