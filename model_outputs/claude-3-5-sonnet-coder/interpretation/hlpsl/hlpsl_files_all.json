The protocol uses Physical Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and cryptographic hash functions to establish a secure session key between the vehicles.\n\n## Entities\n- **OBU1**: First vehicle's on-board unit\n- **OBU2**: Second vehicle's on-board unit\n- **SN**: Service Node that assists in the authentication process\n\n## Parameters and Functions\n- **PID1, PID2**: Pseudonym IDs for OBU1 and OBU2\n- **P**: Public parameter for Diffie-Hellman key exchange\n- **C1, C2**: Challenge values for PUF functions\n- **PUF1, PUF2**: Physical Unclonable Functions of OBU1 and OBU2\n- **H**: Hash function\n\n## Protocol Flow\n\n### Phase 1: Initial Authentication Request\n1. OBU1 generates a random value A1 and computes Q1 = P^A1\n2. OBU1 computes MAC = H(PID1.PID2.Q1)\n3. OBU1 sends (PID1.PID2.Q1.MAC) to SN\n\n### Phase 2: SN Processing and Forwarding\n1. SN verifies MAC = H(PID1.PID2.Q1)\n2. SN computes:\n   - R1 = PUF1(C1)\n   - R2 = PUF2(C2)\n   - R2en = R1 \u2295 R2 (XOR)\n   - Hs2 = H(C1.C2.R2en.PID1.R2.Q1)\n3. SN sends (PID1.C1.C2.R2en.Q1.Hs2) to OBU2\n\n### Phase 3: OBU2 Processing\n1. OBU2 verifies Hs2 = H(C1.C2.R2en.PID1.PUF2(C2).Q1)\n2. OBU2 computes:\n   - R2 = PUF2(C2)\n   - R1 = R2en \u2295 R2\n   - Generates a random value A2 and computes Q2 = P^A2\n   - H21 = H(C1.R1.Q2.PID1.PID2.Q1)\n3. OBU2 sends (C1.Q2.H21) to OBU1\n\n### Phase 4: Final Authentication\n1. OBU1 verifies H21 = H(C1.PUF1(C1).Q2.PID1.PID2.Q1)\n2. OBU1 computes:\n   - R1 = PUF1(C1)\n   - Key = Q2^A1 (Diffie-Hellman key)\n   - H12 = H(R1.PID1.PID2.Q2.Key)\n3. OBU1 sends H12 to OBU2\n4. OBU2 verifies H12 = H(R1.PID1.PID2.Q2.Q1^A2)\n\n## Security Goals\n1. **Secrecy of R1**: The PUF response of OBU1 should be known only to OBU1, OBU2, and SN\n2. **Secrecy of R2**: The PUF response of OBU2 should be known only to OBU1, OBU2, and SN\n3. **Secrecy of A1**: OBU1's Diffie-Hellman private key should be known only to OBU1, OBU2, and SN\n4. **Secrecy of A2**: OBU2's Diffie-Hellman private key should be known only to OBU1, OBU2, and SN\n5. **Authentication of H12**: OBU2 should be able to authenticate that H12 came from OBU1\n6. **Authentication of Hs2**: OBU2 should be able to authenticate that Hs2 came from SN\n\n## Note\nThe protocol combines PUF-based device authentication with Diffie-Hellman key exchange to provide mutual authentication between vehicles while establishing a shared session key."]]}, "HLPSL-1/TLS.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%% YAZAR: MEHMET EM\u0130N KONUK\n%% PROTOKOL: TLS: Transport Layer Security (Ta\u015f\u0131ma Katman\u0131 G\u00fcvenli\u011fi)\n%% **Bu spesifikasyon TLS protokol\u00fcn\u00fcn AVISPA i\u00e7in k\u0131salt\u0131lm\u0131\u015f bir versiyonudur**\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\n% This HLPSL specification models a simplified version of the TLS protocol.\n% The protocol involves the following steps:\n% 1.

Normal session between honest agents a and b\n2. Session where intruder i impersonates server b to client a\n3.

A generates a random value X and sends G^X to B\n2. B receives G^X, generates a random value Y, and sends G^Y to A\n3. Both A and B compute the shared key as (G^X)^Y = (G^Y)^X\n4. A generates a secret nonce N and encrypts it with the shared key, then sends it to B\n5. B decrypts the message to obtain the nonce N\n\n### Security Goals:\n- The protocol aims to maintain the secrecy of the nonce N (identified by sec_1)\n- Only A and B should know the value of N\n\n### Protocol Steps:\n```\n1.

Each of the hops shares a symmetric key with its\n%% neighbouring hops and forwards messages in the chain decrypting and\n%% re-encrypting them accordingly. All the hops and AuF have to be\n%% honest, since if one of them modifies messages or inserts new ones,\n%% the protocol trivially cannot provide authentication. In our\n%% formalisation we have modelled no intermediate hops (so VGK and AuF\n%% directly share a key) and a simple reduction proof shows that all\n%% attacks possible in a setting with an arbitrary number of intermediate\n%% hops can be simulated in our model with no intermediate hops. Note,\n%% however, that it is not possible to take this idea further and \"merge\" an\n%% honest VGK with AuF, as demonstrated by the attacks we have discovered\n%% where the intruder eavesdrops and replays messages (that he cannot\n%% decrypt) exchanged between VGK and AuF.\n%%\n%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \t\n%%  HLPSL:\nrole mobileTerminal (\n    MT,VGK,AuF : agent,       % MT: Mobile Terminal, VGK: Visited Gate Keeper, AuF: Authentication Facility\n    SND,RCV    : channel(dy), % Dolev-Yao channels for sending and receiving\n    F          : hash_func,   % Hash function\n    ZZ\t       : symmetric_key, % Symmetric key shared between MT and AuF\n    NIL,G      : text)        % NIL: null value, G: generator for Diffie-Hellman\nplayed_by MT def=\n\n  local\n    State       : nat,        % Current state of the role\n    X,CH1,CH3   : text,       % X: MT's DH exponent, CH1/CH3: Challenge values\n    CH2,CH4     : text,       % CH2/CH4: Challenge values from VGK\n    GY,Key      : message     % GY: g^Y from VGK, Key: DH shared key g^(XY)\n\n  const sec_m_Key : protocol_id % Constant for secrecy goal\n    \n  init  State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n % MT initiates the protocol by sending its DH value and a challenge\n 1.

The \n%%   attack works by first observing a session between honest agents and\n%%   then replaying messages from this session to $VGK$, posing both as\n%%   $MT$ and $AuF$. Use option sessco to find this attack with OFMC.\n%%   Another attack recently discovered with OFMC is based on the fact that\n%%   $VGK$ cannot distinguish messages (2) and (3). \n%%\n%% NOTES:\n%%\n%% The fixed version, also included in this library, is not vulnerable to\n%% the attacks. \n%%\n%% In the original protocol description there is a chain of intermediate\n%% hops between VGK and AuF, where the length of this chain depends on\n%% the concrete setting. Each of the hops shares a symmetric key with its\n%% neighbouring hops and forwards messages in the chain decrypting and\n%% re-encrypting them accordingly. All the hops and AuF have to be\n%% honest, since if one of them modifies messages or inserts new ones,\n%% the protocol trivially cannot provide authentication. In our\n%% formalisation we have modelled no intermediate hops (so VGK and AuF\n%% directly share a key) and a simple reduction proof shows that all\n%% attacks possible in a setting with an arbitrary number of intermediate\n%% hops can be simulated in our model with no intermediate hops. Note,\n%% however, that it is not possible to take this idea further and \"merge\" an\n%% honest VGK with AuF, as demonstrated by the attacks we have discovered\n%% where the intruder eavesdrops and replays messages (that he cannot\n%% decrypt) exchanged between VGK and AuF.\n%%\n%%\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% \t\n%%  HLPSL:\nrole mobileTerminal (\n    MT,VGK,AuF : agent,       % MT: Mobile Terminal, VGK: Visited Gate Keeper, AuF: Authentication Facility\n    SND,RCV    : channel(dy), % Dolev-Yao channels for sending and receiving\n    F          : hash_func,   % Hash function\n    ZZ\t       : symmetric_key, % Symmetric key shared between MT and AuF\n    NIL,G      : text)        % NIL: null value, G: generator for Diffie-Hellman\nplayed_by MT def=\n\n  local\n    State       : nat,        % Current state of the role\n    X,CH1,CH3   : text,       % X: MT's DH exponent, CH1/CH3: Challenge values\n    CH2,CH4     : text,       % CH2/CH4: Challenge values from VGK\n    GY,Key      : message     % GY: g^Y from VGK, Key: DH shared key g^(XY)\n\n  const sec_m_Key : protocol_id % Constant for secrecy goal\n    \n  init  State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n % MT initiates the protocol by sending its DH value and a challenge\n 1.

An attacker can observe a session between honest agents and then replay messages to VGK, posing as both MT and AuF. Another vulnerability is that VGK cannot distinguish between messages (2) and (3).\n\n## Implementation Notes\nIn the actual protocol, there may be intermediate hops between VGK and AuF, with each hop sharing a symmetric key with neighboring hops. The model simplifies this by having VGK and AuF communicate directly."]]}, "HLPSL-1/IKEv2-DS.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: IKEv2: Internet Key Exchange, version 2\n%% VARIANT: authentication based on digital signatures\n%% PURPOSE:\n%% IKE is designed to perform mutual authentication and key\n%% exchange prior to setting up an IPsec connection.\n%%\n%% IKEv2 exists in several variants, the defining difference\n%% being the authentication method used.  \n%%\n%% This variant, which we call IKEv2-DS, uses digital signatures.\n%%\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\cite{ipsec-ikev2}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%% \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\item Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% IKEv2-DS proceeds in two so-called exchanges.

A \u2192 B: SAa1, KEa, Na\n   - SAa1: Cryptosuite offers from A\n   - KEa: Diffie-Hellman half key from A (g^DHX)\n   - Na: Nonce generated by A\n\n2. B \u2192 A: SAb1, KEb, Nb\n   - SAb1: B's selected cryptosuite (in our model: SAa1 = SAb1)\n   - KEb: Diffie-Hellman half key from B (g^DHY)\n   - Nb: Nonce generated by B\n\n### IKE_SA_AUTH Exchange:\n3. A \u2192 B: {A, AUTHa, SAa2}K\n   - K = H(Na.Nb.SAa1.g^KEa^KEb) [shared key derived from exchanged values]\n   - AUTHa = {SAa1.g^KEa.Na.Nb}inv(Ka) [signature using A's private key]\n   - SAa2: A's crypto offers for CHILD_SA\n\n4. B \u2192 A: {B, AUTHb, SAb2}K\n   - AUTHb = {SAb1.g^KEb.Na.Nb}inv(Kb) [signature using B's private key]\n   - SAb2: B's crypto preferences for CHILD_SA (in our model: SAa2 = SAb2)\n\n## Security Goals\n1. Authentication between parties (G1, G2, G3, G7, G10)\n2. Secrecy of the established shared key (G9)\n\n## Roles\n- **alice**: Initiator of the protocol\n- **bob**: Responder\n- **session**: Composition of alice and bob roles\n- **environment**: Defines the global constants and models the sessions, including those involving the intruder\n\n## Known Limitations\n- Negotiation of cryptographic algorithms is abstracted away (assumes SAa1 = SAb1 and SAa2 = SAb2)\n- Identity hiding is not considered\n- Exchange of public-key certificates is not modeled\n- Traffic selectors specific to IP networking are not modeled\n\n## Known Issues\nA man-in-the-middle attack is possible where the intruder can relay messages between different sessions to convince bob that he is talking to alice when alice is actually communicating with the intruder. This attack doesn't compromise the session key but affects authentication. Adding key confirmation (having parties use the established key) would prevent this attack."]]}, "HLPSL-1/NSPK_2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%Alice - Bob\n%\n%   1. A -> B: {Na,A}_Kb\n%   2.

The protocol involves three roles: Alice (A), Bob (B), and a trusted Server (S).\n\n## Protocol Flow\n\n1. Alice initiates the protocol by sending her identity and a fresh nonce Na to Bob:\n   ```\n   A \u2192 B: A, Na\n   ```\n\n2. Bob responds with his identity and a fresh nonce Nb:\n   ```\n   B \u2192 A: B, Nb\n   ```\n\n3. Alice encrypts her identity, Bob's identity, and both nonces with her key shared with the server (Kas) and sends it to Bob:\n   ```\n   A \u2192 B: {A, B, Na, Nb}Kas\n   ```\n\n4. Bob forwards Alice's encrypted message along with his own encryption of Alice's identity, his identity, and both nonces using his key shared with the server (Kbs):\n   ```\n   B \u2192 S: {A, B, Na, Nb}Kas, {A, B, Na, Nb}Kbs\n   ```\n\n5. The server decrypts both messages, verifies their consistency, and creates a fresh session key Kab. The server then sends two encrypted messages back to Bob:\n   ```\n   S \u2192 B: {B, Na, Nb, Kab}Kas, {A, Na, Nb, Kab}Kbs\n   ```\n\n6. Bob decrypts the second part using Kbs to obtain Kab. He then forwards the first part to Alice along with a message encrypted with Kab to prove he knows the session key:\n   ```\n   B \u2192 A: {B, Na, Nb, Kab}Kas, {Na, Nb}Kab\n   ```\n\n7. Alice decrypts the first part using Kas to obtain Kab. She then confirms the protocol completion by sending Nb encrypted with Kab:\n   ```\n   A \u2192 B: {Nb}Kab\n   ```\n\n## Security Properties\n\nThe protocol aims to achieve the following security properties:\n- Authentication: Both Alice and Bob are authenticated to each other\n- Key secrecy: The session key Kab is only known to Alice, Bob, and the trusted server\n- Key freshness: A new session key is generated for each protocol run\n\n## HLPSL Implementation Details\n\nThe HLPSL specification consists of:\n1. Role definitions for Alice, Bob, and the Server\n2. Session composition that connects these roles\n3. Environment role that defines the overall security context\n4. Security goals specifying that authentication on the kab_id (session key identifier) should be verified\n\nThe protocol includes security features like:\n- Fresh nonces (Na, Nb) for replay protection\n- Witness and request declarations for authentication verification\n- Symmetric key encryption for confidentiality\n\nThe specification also includes two parallel sessions to allow verification of security properties under potential interference between concurrent protocol runs."]]}, "HLPSL-1/XorNSPK_1.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%NSPKxor Protocol\n% Needham-Schroeder Public Key protocol with XOR modification\n%\n%   1.

The protocol uses nonces and XOR operations for authentication.\n\n## Protocol Steps\n1. A initiates the protocol and generates a fresh nonce Na.\n2. A sends Na to B.\n3. B receives Na and responds by sending XOR(Na,S), where S is a shared secret.\n4. A receives XOR(Na,S) and verifies it, confirming B's identity.\n\n## Security Goals\n1. **Secrecy**: The shared secret S should remain confidential between A and B.\n2. **Authentication**: A should be able to authenticate that B was the sender of the response.\n\n## Role Specifications\n\n### Role A\n- Initiates the protocol\n- Generates and sends a fresh nonce Na\n- Verifies the response from B using the nonce\n- Requests authentication of B based on Na\n\n### Role B\n- Receives nonce Na from A\n- Computes and sends XOR(Na,S) back to A\n- Keeps S secret between A and B\n- Witnesses the authentication of Na\n\n## Sessions\nThe environment includes two identical sessions between Alice and Bob, allowing for the analysis of potential replay attacks.\n\n## Intruder Model\nThe protocol is analyzed under the Dolev-Yao intruder model, where the intruder has knowledge of the agents' identities but not the shared secret."]]}, "HLPSL-1/Anonymous_E2E_authenticated_key_exchange_scheme.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "% Protocol: Authentication protocol with key exchange for smart cards\n% Description: This protocol enables secure communication between a user, home server, and foreign server\n% using smart cards with mutual authentication and session key establishment.\n\nrole user (U, S, F: agent, Kus, Rus, Kas: symmetric_key, Ks: public_key, H, Mul: hash_func, SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by U def=\n\n  local State: nat,\n       SPWim, SAim, Ri, SIDim, Umi, Bmi, Tim, Nfp, Nfp1, Qp, Cim1, G, B1mi, Aim, Wmi, Ymi, Dm, Kmi, B2mi, Dmi, Rim, Uim, Ynj, IDsm, Cim2, Kua, Xm, Bpm, A: text\n       % SPWim: User's password\n       % SAim: Authentication value derived from password and identity\n       % SIDim: User's smart card identifier\n       % Ri: Random value\n       % Umi: User authentication parameter\n       % Bmi: Registration token stored in flash memory\n       % Tim: Timestamp for freshness\n       % Aim: User's random value for key generation\n       % Kua: Session key established between user and server\n\n  init State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n% Registration phase\n% The user registers with the home server S to obtain credentials\n\n\t1.

The protocol aims to establish mutual authentication and secure key exchange between a mobile healthcare user and a healthcare server, potentially through a foreign server when roaming.\n\n## Roles and Participants\n- **User (U)**: Mobile healthcare client\n- **Server (S)**: Home healthcare server\n- **Foreign Server (F)**: A server in a different domain\n\n## Cryptographic Primitives\n- **Symmetric Keys**: Kus (user-server), Rus (user-server), Kas (server-foreign)\n- **Public Key**: Ks (server's public key)\n- **Hash Functions**: H, Mul (for multiplication operations)\n- **Nonces**: Various nonces like Nfp, Nfp1, Tim, etc.\n\n## Protocol Phases\n\n### 1. Registration Phase\nThe user registers with their home server:\n1. User generates a password SPWim and calculates SAim = xor(H(SPWim), H(Ri.SIDim))\n2. User sends {SIDim.SAim} encrypted with Kus to the server\n3. Server computes Umi = H(SIDim.Xm) and Bmi = xor(Umi, xor(H(SPWim), H(Ri.SIDim)))\n4. Server sends {Bmi} encrypted with Kus back to the user\n5. User stores Bmi in flash storage and SAim in smart card\n\n### 2. Mutual Authentication and Key Exchange Phase\nWhen a user wants to authenticate (possibly in a foreign domain):\n\n1. **User Initialization**:\n   - User inputs credentials and SIDim\n   - Computes Uim = xor(Bmi, SAim)\n   - Generates timestamp Tim and random nonce Aim\n   - Creates Cim1 = {xor((Uim.SIDim), Tim)}_Ks\n   - Sends Cim1.Tim to the foreign server\n\n2. **Foreign Server Processing**:\n   - Generates nonces Nfp and Nfp1\n   - Creates Qp = xor(Nfp, Nfp1)\n   - Encrypts Qp.Nfp1 with Kas\n   - Computes Cim2 = xor(Cim1, Nfp)\n   - Forwards message to home server\n\n3. **Home Server Authentication**:\n   - Recovers Cim1 and verifies user identity\n   - Generates random B1mi\n   - Computes session parameters:\n     - Wmi = Mul(B1mi.G)\n     - Ymi = Mul(Nfp.Rim.B1mi)\n     - Kmi = Mul(B1mi.Ynj)\n     - B2mi = H(Ymi.Kmi.SIDim.IDsm)\n   - Creates response Dmi = {Wmi.Kmi.B2mi.Nfp.Nfp1}_Rus\n   - Sends encrypted response to foreign server\n\n4. **Foreign Server Forwarding**:\n   - Forwards authentication response to user\n\n5. **User Verification**:\n   - Calculates Kua = Mul(Nfp.Aim.Mul(B1mi.Ynj))\n   - Verifies authentication parameters\n\n## Security Goals\n1. **Secrecy**: Protect the following values:\n   - g1: SIDim (user identity)\n   - g2: SAim (user authentication parameter)\n   - g3: SPWim (user password)\n   - g4: Bmi (server-generated authentication parameter)\n   - g5, g6: Nfp, Nfp1 (foreign server nonces)\n\n2. **Authentication**:\n   - u_s_tim: User authenticates to server using timestamp Tim\n   - s_u_b1mi: Server authenticates to user using parameter B1mi\n\n## Intruder Model\nThe protocol is analyzed against a Dolev-Yao intruder with knowledge of participants' identities, the server's public key, and the intruder's own private key. Sessions are tested with the intruder taking different roles."]]}, "HLPSL-1/An_Autonomous_Log_Storage_Management_Protocol_with_Blockchain_Mechanism_and_Access_Control_for_the_Internet_of_Things.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% This protocol models a secure logging system with three main phases:\n%% 1.

The protocol ensures confidentiality and authenticity of log data through cryptographic mechanisms including ECDSA signatures and symmetric key encryption.\n\n## Protocol Participants\n- **User (U)**: Entity that registers with the authority and later verifies and accesses logs\n- **Authority (A)**: Responsible for user registration and key management\n- **Sensor (S)**: Device that generates and securely transmits log data\n\n## Cryptographic Primitives\n- Symmetric key encryption (between User and Authority)\n- ECDSA signatures for authenticity verification\n- Elliptic curve operations for secure log transmission\n- Hash functions for message integrity\n\n## Protocol Phases\n\n### 1. User Registration Phase\n1. User generates an identity IDi and sends it encrypted with shared key Kau to Authority: {IDi}_Kau\n2. Authority:\n   - Verifies the user identity\n   - Generates random values Alpha and TIDi\n   - Computes the secret key SK = G^(Alpha+TIDi)\n   - Sends SK encrypted to the user: {SK}_Kau\n\n### 2. Log Signcryption Phase (by Sensor)\n1. Sensor:\n   - Generates a random secret value Ss\n   - Computes Ce = G^Ss\n   - Computes C = M\u00b7Y^Ss (M is the log data)\n   - Computes hash Hs = H(C)\n   - Computes log signature X = Hs^(Y\u00b7Ss)\n   - Creates ECDSA signature Sig = {X.IP.T}_inv(ECDSA) containing IP address and timestamp\n   - Sends Ce, C, and Sig to the User\n\n### 3. Log Verification Phase (by User)\n1. User:\n   - Receives Ce, C, Sig from Sensor\n   - Verifies ECDSA signature using public key\n   - Verifies log signature using Y and C\n\n### 4. Log Unsigncryption Phase (by User)\n1. User:\n   - Computes Ys = Pair(SK, G^Ss)\n   - Uses Ys to decrypt C and view the log data M\n\n## Security Goals\n1. **Secrecy**:\n   - User identity (IDi) is confidential between User and Authority\n   - Secret key (SK) is confidential between User and Authority\n   - Authority's private parameter (Alpha) remains secret\n   - Sensor's secret value (Ss) remains confidential\n\n2. **Authentication**:\n   - User can authenticate that the logs came from the legitimate Sensor\n\nThis protocol provides secure and authenticated log management through cryptographic mechanisms that protect both the confidentiality of log data and the authenticity of log sources."]]}, "HLPSL-1/A_Secure_and_Efficient_Smart_Card-based_UCSSO_Scheme_Using_Extended_Chebyshev_Chaotic_Maps_for_Telemedicine_Systems.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "% ==========================================================================\n% Protocol: Anonymous Two-Factor Authentication Protocol with Key Agreement\n% Description: A protocol that provides mutual authentication and key agreement \n%              between user (U) and server (S) using Chebyshev polynomials\n% Security Goals: Authentication, Secrecy, Key Agreement\n% ==========================================================================\n\nrole user (U, S: agent, Kus: symmetric_key, T, H: hash_func, SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by U def=\n\nlocal State: nat,\n      % User identity and credentials\n      IDi, SIDj, PWi, X, Yi, \n      % Registration phase parameters\n      Ai, Aii, Bj, Ui, Uj, Bi, Ci, Bii, Bjj, \n      % Authentication phase parameters\n      Ki, Kij, Ri, Pi, Mi, Sj, Wj, MacSj, MacUi, Xsj: text\n\ninit State := 0\n%/\\ Suppose T(.) is a Chebyshev polynomial, and p & Ni are known to U & S\n\ntransition\n\n% Registration phase\n1.

The protocol consists of two main phases: registration and mutual authentication.\n\n## Agents\n- User (U): The client seeking to authenticate\n- Server (S): The authentication server\n\n## Cryptographic Primitives\n- T(): Chebyshev polynomial function\n- H(): Cryptographic hash function\n- {M}_K: Symmetric encryption of message M with key K\n- xor(): Exclusive-OR operation\n\n## Shared Knowledge\n- Kus: Symmetric key shared between legitimate user U and server S\n- Chebyshev polynomial parameters (p and Ni) are known to both U and S\n\n## Protocol Phases\n\n### 1. Registration Phase\n1. User U:\n   - Generates identity IDi, server identity SIDj, password PWi, and random value Yi\n   - Computes Ai = T(Yi.X) where X is a system parameter\n   - Computes Aii = xor(H(PWi)_Ai, H(Yi.SIDj)_Ai)\n   - Sends {IDi.Aii}_Kus to Server S\n\n2. Server S:\n   - Computes Bj = T(Xsj.X) where Xsj is S's secret\n   - Computes Ui = H(IDi)_Bj\n   - Computes Uj = H(SIDj)_Bj\n   - Computes Bii = xor(Ui, Aii)\n   - Computes Bjj = xor(Uj, Aii)\n   - Sends {Bii.Bjj}_Kus to User U\n\n### 2. Mutual Authentication Phase\n1. User U:\n   - Retrieves Ui = xor(Bii, Aii)\n   - Computes Ki = xor(Aii, H(Yi)_Ai)\n   - Retrieves Ri = xor(Bjj, H(Yi)_Ai)\n   - Generates random Pi\n   - Computes Mi = T(Yi.Pi)\n   - Computes Bi = Mi_Ui\n   - Computes Ci = {IDi.Bi.Pi}_Ki\n   - Sends Ri.Ci to Server S\n\n2. Server S:\n   - Computes Ki = xor(Ri, H(SIDj)_Bj)\n   - Decrypts Ci to obtain IDi, Bi, and Pi\n   - Decrypts Bi using Ui to obtain Mi\n   - Generates random Sj\n   - Computes Wj = T(Sj.Pi)\n   - Computes Kij = H(T(Sj.Mi))\n   - Computes MacSj = H(SIDj.IDi.Mi)_Kij\n   - Sends MacSj.Wj to User U\n\n3. User U:\n   - Computes Kij = H(Yi.T(Sj.Pi))\n   - Verifies MacSj = H(SIDj.IDi.Mi)_Kij\n   - Computes MacUi = H(IDi.SIDj.T(Sj.Pi))_Kij\n   - Sends MacUi to Server S\n\n4. Server S:\n   - Verifies MacUi = H(IDi.SIDj.T(Sj.Pi))_Kij\n\n## Security Goals\n1. Secrecy:\n   - IDi is known only to U and S (g1)\n   - Ai is known only to U and S (g2)\n   - PWi is known only to U (g3)\n   - Bii is known only to U and S (g4)\n   - Bjj is known only to U and S (g5)\n   - Xsj is known only to S (g6)\n\n2. Authentication:\n   - Authentication of U to S via Pi (u_s_pi)\n   - Authentication of S to U via Sj (s_u_sj)\n\n## Intruder Model\n- The protocol is analyzed under the Dolev-Yao intruder model\n- Three session scenarios are considered:\n  1. Legitimate session between user and server\n  2. Session where intruder impersonates user\n  3. Session where intruder impersonates server"]]}, "HLPSL-1/CHAPv2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: (MS-)CHAPv2\n%% Challenge/Response Authentication Protocol, version 2\n%% PURPOSE:\n%% Mutual authentication between a server and a client who share a password.\n%% CHAPv2 is the authentication protocol for the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\n%% suite (PPTP).\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\cite{RFC2759}\n%% MODELER:\n%%\\begin{itemize}\n%%\\item Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n%%\\item Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z\\\"urich\n%%\\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% We assume that the server \\verb!B! and client \\verb!A! share \n%% password \\verb!k(A,B)! in advance.

It allows a server and client who share a password to authenticate each other through a challenge-response mechanism.\n\n## Protocol Participants\n- Client (A): The entity initiating the authentication\n- Server (B): The entity responding to the authentication request\n\n## Assumptions\n- The client A and server B share a symmetric key Kab (password) in advance\n- Both parties can generate nonces (random numbers)\n- A secure hash function H is available to both parties\n\n## Protocol Flow\n1. A \u2192 B: A (Client sends identity)\n2. B \u2192 A: Nb (Server sends a challenge nonce)\n3. A \u2192 B: Na, H(Kab, (Na, Nb, A)) (Client sends its nonce and a hash)\n4. B \u2192 A: H(Kab, Na) (Server responds with a hash)\n\n## Security Goals\n1. Authentication: Client authenticates server and server authenticates client\n2. Secrecy: The shared key Kab remains secret between A and B\n\n## Roles\n1. **Client (Initiator)**: \n   - Sends identity\n   - Responds to challenge with nonce and hash\n   - Verifies server's response\n\n2. **Server (Responder)**:\n   - Issues challenge nonce\n   - Verifies client's response\n   - Sends confirmation hash\n\n## Security Properties\n- G1, G2: Mutual authentication between client and server\n- G12: Secrecy of the shared key\n\n## Implementation Notes\n- The protocol uses a hash function for authentication rather than encryption\n- Both parties generate their own nonces for freshness\n- The authentication depends on the secrecy of the shared key Kab\n\nThis protocol can be modeled in HLPSL with initiator and responder roles, session composition, and appropriate security goals for verification by the AVISPA tool."]]}, "HLPSL-1/DHCP-delayed-auth.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: DHCP-Delayed-Auth\n%% PURPOSE:\n%%    Delayed entity and message authentication for DHCP\n%%\n%% REFERENCE: RFC 3118, \\url{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3118.html}\n%% MODELER: \n%%   \\begin{itemize}\n%%   \\item Graham Steel, University of Edinburgh, July 2004\n%%   \\item Luca Compagna, AI-Lab DIST University of Genova, November 2004\n%%   \\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%%\\begin{verbatim}\n%%1.

How the fast authentication mechanism works compared to the initial authentication\n\nThe annotations provide clarity while ensuring the original code remains completely unchanged and the final hlpsl code can be run by the AVISPA tool."]], "logic": [[true, "# Protocol Description for Two-Factor Authentication with Fast Login\n\nThis protocol describes a secure two-factor authentication scheme with fast login capabilities for smart cards and USBs. The protocol consists of three main phases:\n\n1. Registration Phase\n2. Login and Initial Authentication Phase\n3. Fast Authentication Phase\n\n## Entities\n- User (U): The client attempting to authenticate\n- Server (S): The authentication server\n- Smart card: First authentication factor storing user credentials\n- USB device: Second authentication factor storing additional credentials\n\n## Security Parameters\n- Kus: A symmetric key shared between user and server\n- SKij: A session key for secure communication\n- Ks: Server's public key\n- H, H1, H2, H6, H7, H14, H16: Various hash functions\n\n## Registration Phase\n1. The user creates a new account by:\n   - Selecting identity IDi, password PWi, and biometric data Bi\n   - Computing BBi = H(PWi.Bi)\n   - Computing W = H(H(PWi.E).xor(h(xor(IDi,IDj)),E))\n   - Sending {IDi.W.BBi}_Kus to the server\n\n2. The server:\n   - Processes the user registration\n   - Creates Yij = {H(Xj).IDj.IDi.W.BBi}_Xj\n   - Sends {IDi.Nj.Yij}_Kus back to the user\n\n3. The user:\n   - Stores E, IDi, PWi, Bi in the smart card\n   - Stores Ej', IDj, Nj in the USB device\n\n## Login and Initial Authentication Phase\n1. The user initiates authentication by:\n   - Inserting smart card\n   - Entering password PWi and biometric Bi\n   - Generating random nonce V\n   - Computing N = H(H(H(V)))\n   - Computing BBi = H(PWi.Bi)\n   - Computing W = H(H(PWi.E).xor(h(xor(IDi,IDj)),E))\n   - Computing Yij = xor(E,Ej)\n   - Generating timestamp Tu\n   - Computing A = xor(xor(BBi,W),Tu)\n   - Sending {IDi.IDj.Yij.N.A.Tu}_Ks to the server\n\n2. The server authenticates by:\n   - Verifying Tu is fresh\n   - Decrypting Yij using Xj\n   - Verifying H(Xj), IDj and IDi\n   - Computing A and verifying it\n   - Generating timestamp Ts\n   - Computing B = xor(H(H(H(H(V)))),Ts)\n   - Computing new identity IDinew = H(Yij.IDi.H(Xj))\n   - Generating T1, T2, As, Bs\n   - Computing ATa = H6(H(IDinew.Xj.As))\n   - Computing ATb = H14(H(IDinew.Xj.Bs))\n   - Computing session key SKij = H(xor(N,Yij))\n   - Sending {B.IDinew.ATa.ATb.Ts}_SKij and T1, T2 to the user\n\n3. The user:\n   - Verifies Ts is fresh\n   - Verifies B\n   - Stores IDinew, ATa, ATb in the smart card\n   - Stores T1, T2 in the USB device\n\n## Fast Authentication Phase\n1. The user authenticates quickly by:\n   - Entering IDinew, PWi, and Bi\n   - Computing Ay = H(H1(H6(H(H(Yij.IDi.H(Xj)).Xj.As)))).H(H2(H14(H(H(Yij.IDi.H(Xj)).Xj.Bs))))\n   - Sending Ay to the server\n\n2. The server validates by:\n   - Computing X = H(IDinew.Xj.As)\n   - Computing Y = H(IDinew.Xj.Bs)\n   - Computing Ay = H(H7(X).H16(Y))\n   - Verifying Ay matches\n   - Computing By = {H(xor(Ay,IDinew))}_SKij\n   - Sending By to the user\n\n3. The user:\n   - Confirms By\n\n## Security Goals\n1. Secrecy of:\n   - E (g1): Only known to user\n   - IDi (g2): Known to user and server\n   - PWi (g3): Only known to user\n   - Bi (g4): Only known to user\n   - Xj (g5): Only known to server\n   - As (g6): Only known to server\n   - Bs (g7): Only known to server\n\n2.

This enables strong password-only authenticated key exchange.\n\n## Protocol Participants\n- A: Initiator\n- B: Responder\n\n## Shared Knowledge\n- Both parties share a symmetric key Kab (password)\n\n## Protocol Flow\n1. **Key Exchange Phase**:\n   - A generates random value Na\n   - A sends exp(Kab, Na) to B\n   - B generates random value Nb\n   - B sends exp(Kab, Nb) to A\n   - Both compute the shared session key K = exp(exp(Kab, Na), Nb) = exp(exp(Kab, Nb), Na)\n\n2. **Challenge/Response Authentication Phase**:\n   - A generates challenge Ca\n   - A sends {Ca}_K to B (Ca encrypted with K)\n   - B generates challenge Cb\n   - B sends {Cb,Ca}_K to A (Cb and Ca encrypted with K)\n   - A sends {Cb}_K to B (Cb encrypted with K)\n\n## Security Goals\n1. **Confidentiality**:\n   - Challenges Ca and Cb should remain secret between A and B\n\n2. **Authentication**:\n   - A should authenticate B based on B's knowledge of Cb\n   - B should authenticate A based on A's knowledge of Ca\n\n## Threat Model\n- Standard Dolev-Yao intruder model\n- The intruder may participate in legitimate protocol runs with honest agents\n\n## Formal Properties\n- **Secrecy properties**: sec_i_Ca, sec_i_Cb, sec_r_Ca, sec_r_Cb\n- **Authentication properties**: authentication_on ca, authentication_on cb\n\nThis protocol provides strong security even when using weak passwords since the password itself is never transmitted over the network.

The server initiates the communication and the client responds with a digital signature to prove its identity.\n\n## Roles and Agents\n- **A**: The client who needs to prove its identity\n- **B**: The server who wants to verify the client's identity\n- **S**: Implicitly a certification authority who has signed A's public key\n\n## Protocol Flow\n1. B \u2192 A : Rb, Text1\n   - B generates a fresh nonce Rb and sends it to A along with some text (Text1)\n   \n2. A \u2192 B : {PKa,A}inv(PKs), Ra, Rb, B, Text2, {Ra,Rb,B,Text1}inv(PKa)\n   - A sends:\n     - Its certificate {PKa,A}inv(PKs) signed by trusted authority S\n     - A fresh nonce Ra\n     - The nonce Rb received from B\n     - The identity of B\n     - Some text (Text2)\n     - A digital signature {Ra,Rb,B,Text1}inv(PKa) created with A's private key\n\n## Cryptographic Elements\n- **PKa**: A's public key\n- **PKs**: Server/certification authority's public key\n- **inv(PKa)**: A's private key\n- **inv(PKs)**: Server/certification authority's private key\n- **{PKa,A}inv(PKs)**: A's certificate signed by the certification authority\n- **Ra, Rb**: Fresh nonces (random numbers) generated by A and B respectively\n- **Text1, Text2**: Arbitrary text messages\n\n## Security Goals\n- Authentication: B should be able to authenticate A (G1, G2)\n- The authentication is based on the witness/request mechanism for the 'ra' protocol ID\n\n## Threat Model\n- Dolev-Yao intruder model (can intercept, analyze, and forge messages)\n- The intruder knows:\n  - Identities of agents (i, a, b)\n  - Public keys (pks, pki)\n  - Its own private key (inv(pki))\n  - The context texts (ctext1, ctext2)\n  - Its own certificate {pki.i}_inv(pks)\n\n## Sessions\nThe environment includes three sessions:\n1. Normal session between honest agents a and b\n2. Session where honest a communicates with intruder i\n3. Session where intruder i impersonates a to communicate with honest b"]]}, "HLPSL-1/Kerberos.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)\n%% VARIANT: basic (core)\n%% PURPOSE: Authentication, Authorisation, Key Exchange\n%%\n%% Kerberos is a distributed authentication service that allows a process\n%% (a client) running on behalf of a principal (a user) to prove its identity\n%% to a verifier (an application server, or just server) without sending data\n%% across the network that might allow an attacker or the verifier to\n%% subsequently impersonate the principal.

C \u2192 A: C, G, Lifetime_1, N_1\n   - Client requests access to TGS with nonce N_1\n\n2. A \u2192 C: C, Ticket_1, {G, K_CG, Tstart, Texpire, N_1}K_CA\n   - AS replies with Ticket_1 = {C, G, K_CG, Tstart, Texpire}K_AG and encrypted session key\n\n3. C \u2192 G: S, Lifetime_2, N_2, Ticket_1, {C, T}K_CG\n   - Client forwards ticket to TGS and requests access to server S with nonce N_2\n\n4. G \u2192 C: C, Ticket_2, {S, K_CS, Tstart2, Texpire2, N_2}K_CG\n   - TGS replies with Ticket_2 = {C, S, K_CS, Tstart2, Texpire2}K_GS and encrypted session key\n\n5. C \u2192 S: Ticket_2, {C, T2}K_CS\n   - Client presents ticket to application server with timestamp\n\n6. S \u2192 C: {T2}K_CS\n   - Server confirms authentication by returning encrypted timestamp\n\n## Security Goals\n1. **Secrecy**: Protection of session keys (K_CG, K_CS)\n2. **Authentication**:\n   - Client authenticates Authentication Server (via K_CG)\n   - TGS authenticates Authentication Server (via K_CG)\n   - Client authenticates TGS (via K_CS)\n   - Application Server authenticates TGS (via K_CS)\n   - Client authenticates Application Server (via timestamp verification)\n   - Application Server authenticates Client (via timestamp verification)\n   - TGS authenticates Client (via timestamp verification)\n\n## Roles in HLPSL\n1. **kerberos_A**: Authentication Server role\n2. **kerberos_G**: Ticket Granting Server role\n3. **kerberos_S**: Application Server role\n4. **kerberos_C**: Client role\n5. **session**: Composition of the four basic roles\n6. **environment**: Defines the global constants and intruder knowledge\n\n## Protocol Features\n- Uses symmetric cryptography for all operations\n- Employs timestamps for freshness\n- Implements ticket-based authentication\n- Provides session key distribution\n- Supports mutual authentication between client and server\n\n## Limitations\n- Ticket caching is not performed in this model\n- Only provides weak authentication\n- Timestamps are modeled as fresh nonces"]]}}
