Below is a detailed description of the protocol specification based on the provided SPDL content:\n\n### Protocol Participants\nThe protocol involves two primary roles:\n- **Initiator (I)**: The party initiating the communication.\n- **Responder (R)**: The party responding to the initiator.\n\n### Types and Constants\n- **usertype SessionKey**: A user-defined type for session keys.\n- **const Fresh: Function**: A constant to represent the freshness property.\n- **const Compromised: Function**: A constant to denote the compromised state, though not used directly in the protocol steps.\n\n### Shared Knowledge\n- **k(I,R)** is a pre-shared session key used to encrypt messages between I and R. It is important to note that while k(I,R) is conceptually the same as k(R,I), this specific representation does not equalize them in the modeling tool, potentially missing some attack vectors relying on this symmetry.\n\n### Protocol Steps\nThe protocol consists of two roles with specific steps to ensure mutual authentication and secrecy of session keys.\n\n#### Role: Initiator (I)\n1. **Step 1**: `I` generates a fresh nonce `ni` and sends it to `R` along with its identity `I`.\n   - Message: `(I, ni)`\n2. **Step 2**: Upon receiving a message from `R`, the initiator expects an encrypted payload containing its nonce `ni`, a session key `kir`, and the identity of `R`. This is decrypted using `k(I,R)`.\n   - Encrypted Message: `{ni, kir, R}k(I,R)`\n3. **Step 3**: The initiator sends back the nonce `ni` encrypted with the session key `kir`.\n   - Message: `{ni}kir`\n4. **Step 4**: After claiming synchronization and secrecy properties, it records receiving a fresh nonce `nr` from `R`.\n5. **Claims**:\n   - `claim_I1(I,Nisynch)`: Ensures synchronization with `R`.\n   - `claim_I2(I,Secret, kir)`: Ensures the secrecy of the session key `kir`.\n   - `claim_I3(I,Empty, (Fresh,kir))`: Asserts the freshness of the session key `kir`.\n\n#### Role: Responder (R)\n1. **Step 1**: After receiving the message with `I`'s identity and nonce `ni`, `R` proceeds.\n2. **Step 2**: `R` generates a fresh session key `kir` and nonce `nr`, then sends back an encrypted message containing `ni`, `kir`, and its identity `R`.\n   - Encrypted Message: `{ni, kir, R}k(I,R)`\n3. **Step 3**: It expects a message back from `I`, verifying the nonce with the session key `kir`.\n   - Message: `{ni}kir`\n4. **Step 4**: `R` sends its fresh nonce `nr` to `I`.\n5. **Claims**:\n   - `claim_R1(R,Nisynch)`: Ensures synchronization with `I`.\n   - `claim_R2(R,Secret, kir)`: Ensures the secrecy of the session key `kir`.\n   - `claim_R3(R,Empty, (Fresh,kir))`: Asserts the freshness of the session key `kir`.\n\n### Security Considerations\n- The protocol intends to provide mutual authentication and ensure the secrecy and freshness of session keys used in the exchange.\n- Certain attack vectors might not be detected due to the representation limitation of the shared key not being symmetric.\n\nThis description encapsulates the essential steps and security claims of the protocol and allows for reconstructing the SPDL code for use with the Scyther tool."]]}, "SPDL-1/tls-BM-1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/*\n * This is a model of a version of the TLS protocol as modeled in\n * Boyd, Mathuria \"Protocols for Authentication and key establishment\"\n *\n * It's a very simplified form.\n */\n\n/* Annotations to enhance understanding and ensure Scyther syntax */\n\n/** \n * Functions for public and private key operations\n */\nconst pk, hash: Function;\nsecret sk, unhash: Function;\ninversekeys(pk, sk);

An adversary, Eve, and another agent, Terence, are also defined but they don't partake explicitly in this simplified model.\n\n- **Functions**:\n  - **`pk` and `sk`**: Represent the public and private keys for asymmetric encryption. The relationship between them is defined such that `pk` is the inverse of `sk`.\n  - **`hash` and `unhash`**: A pair of inverse functions used for hashing and presumably verifying data integrity.\n  - **`hash` function with multiple parameters**: Demonstrates the generation of a hash using a combination of nonce values and other encrypted data.\n\n- **Roles**:\n\n  **Role A (Alice)**:\n  - Generates a fresh nonce `na` and a pre-master key `pmk`.\n  - **Send_1**: Sends a message containing `na` to Bob.\n  - **Recv_2**: Receives a nonce `nb` from Bob.\n  - **Send_3**: Sends several items to Bob:\n    - `{ pmk }pk(B)`: The pre-master key encrypted with Bob's public key.\n    - `{ hash(na, nb, { pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A)`: A hashed combination of nonces and encrypted `pmk`, signed with Alice's private key.\n    - A double hash `{ hash(na, nb, { pmk }pk(B), { hash(na, nb, { pmk }pk(B)) }sk(A)) }hash(pmk, na, nb)`.\n  - **Recv_4**: Awaits confirmation from Bob with the complete message structure returned to Alice. This is also hashed with `pmk`, `na`, and `nb`.\n  - Claims:\n    - **Claim_A1**: Declares `hash(pmk, na, nb)` as a secret that must remain confidential.\n    - **Claim_A2**: Ensures non-injective synchronization (Nisynch) with Bob.\n\n  **Role B (Bob)**:\n  - Receives variables `na` and generates a fresh nonce `nb`.\n  - **Recv_1**: Accepts the nonce `na` from Alice.\n  - **Send_2**: Sends back the nonce `nb` to Alice.\n  - **Recv_3**: Receives the message containing:\n    - `{ pmk }pk(B)`: Pre-master key in an encrypted form.\n    - Signature and double-hashed components as sent by Alice.\n  - **Send_4**: Confirms receipt to Alice by sending the full received message structure hashed again for confirmation.\n  - Claims:\n    - **Claim_B1**: Ensures that `hash(pmk, na, nb)` is a protected secret.\n    - **Claim_B2**: Ensures non-injective synchronization with Alice.\n\n**Protocol Goals and Security Properties**:\n- The protocol aims to securely establish a shared secret `pmk` between Alice and Bob using public key encryption and subsequent hashing for integrity and encryption verification.\n- Both parties confirm a synchronized session and the secrecy of a particular hash value.\n- The setup exhibits mutual exchange of nonces which helps in thwarting replay attacks.\n- Claims in the protocol emphasize the importance of both confidentiality (Secret) and synchronization (Nisynch).\n\nOverall, this SPDL representation simulates a basic security protocol demonstrating the fundamentals of authenticated key exchange with a focus on confidentiality and synchronization of messages between two parties utilizing hashing and public-key cryptography."]]}, "SPDL-1/denning-sacco-lowe.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# Lowe modified Denning-Sacco shared key\n#\n# Modelled after the description in the SPORE library\n# http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/denningSaccoLowe.html\n#\n# Note:\n# According to SPORE there are no attacks on this protocol.

This description can help you generate the corresponding SPDL file for execution with the Scyther tool.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: Lowe Modified Denning-Sacco Shared Key Protocol\n\n#### Overview\nThe Lowe modified Denning-Sacco shared key protocol is a cryptographic authentication protocol intended for establishing a session key between two parties, Initiator (I) and Responder (R), with the assistance of a Trusted Server (S). This protocol modification addresses certain vulnerabilities in the original protocol by enhancing message integrity and temporal freshness constraints.\n\n#### User Types\n- **Key**: Represents a general cryptographic key used in the protocol.\n- **SessionKey**: Represents the session key to be established between the parties.\n- **TimeStamp**: Represents a timestamp used to ensure freshness of messages.\n- **ExpiredTimeStamp**: Represents an outdated timestamp, used for expiration checks.\n- **PseudoFunction**: Represents a pseudo function used within the protocol logic.\n\n#### Constants\n- **dec**: Represents the pseudo function for decryption.\n- **Fresh**: Used to mark elements as freshly generated.\n- **Compromised**: Used to indicate the function for compromised keys.\n\n#### Protocol Roles\nThe protocol defines three roles: Initiator (I), Responder (R), and Server (S).\n\n##### Role: Initiator (I)\n1. **Message 1**: \\(I \\rightarrow S: I, R\\)\n   - Initiator I sends a message to Server S indicating the desire to establish communication with Responder R.\n\n2. **Message 2**: \\(S \\rightarrow I: \\{R, Kir, T, W\\}_{k(I,S)}\\)\n   - Initiator receives a response from Server S containing the Responder's identifier, a session key \\(Kir\\), a timestamp \\(T\\), and a ticket \\(W\\) encrypted with a shared key between Initiator and Server.\n\n3. **Message 3**: \\(I \\rightarrow R: W\\)\n   - Initiator forwards the ticket \\(W\\) to Responder R.\n\n4. **Message 4**: \\(R \\rightarrow I: \\{Nr\\}_{Kir}\\)\n   - Initiator receives a nonce \\(Nr\\) from Responder, encrypted with the session key \\(Kir\\).\n\n5. **Message 5**: \\(I \\rightarrow R: \\{\\{Nr\\}_{dec}\\}_{Kir}\\)\n   - Initiator returns the decrypted nonce, re-encrypted with the session key \\(Kir\\).\n\n6. **Claims**:\n   - **I1**: Agreement on the nonce (Niagree).\n   - **I2**: Synchronization of messages (Nisynch).\n   - **I3**: Session key Kir is secret from Initiator's perspective.\n   - **I4**: Kir was fresh, not reused.\n\n##### Role: Responder (R)\n1. **Message 3**: \\(I \\rightarrow R: \\{Kir, I, T\\}_{k(R,S)}\\)\n   - Responder receives the session initiation information encrypted with the shared key between Responder and Server.\n\n2. **Message 4**: \\(R \\rightarrow I: \\{Nr\\}_{Kir}\\)\n   - Responder generates a fresh nonce \\(Nr\\) and sends it encrypted with the session key \\(Kir\\).\n\n3. **Message 5**: \\(I \\rightarrow R: \\{\\{Nr\\}_{dec}\\}_{Kir}\\)\n   - Responder receives and checks the decrypted nonce.\n\n4. **Claims**:\n   - **R1**: Agreement on the nonce (Niagree).\n   - **R2**: Synchronization of messages (Nisynch).\n   - **R3**: Assurance that session key Kir remains secret.\n   - **R4**: Verification that Kir was freshly generated.\n\n##### Role: Server (S)\n1. **Message 1**: \\(I \\rightarrow S: I, R\\)\n   - Server receives a request from Initiator indicating the desired communication with Responder R.\n\n2. **Message 2**: \\(S \\rightarrow I: \\{R, Kir, T, \\{Kir, I, T\\}_{k(R,S)}\\}_{k(I,S)}\\)\n   - Server generates a fresh session key \\(Kir\\) and timestamp \\(T\\), and responds to Initiator with encrypted information for both parties.\n\n#### Security Considerations\n- The protocol claims synchronization and mutual agreement between parties, described through specified claims.\n- It addresses pre-play attacks through the use of timestamps and the encrypted exchange of nonces.\n- The freshness of session keys is emphasized, asserting uniqueness via the Fresh function.\n\nBy following the description, the corresponding SPDL file can be crafted for use with the Scyther tool, ensuring proper protocol analysis and verification under the defined roles and claims."]]}, "SPDL-1/kaochow.spdl": {"code": [[true, "# Kao Chow Authentication v.1\n#\n# Modelled after the description in the SPORE library\n# http://www.lsv.ens-cachan.fr/spore/kaoChow1.html\n#\n\n# Define a usertype for SessionKey\nusertype SessionKey;\n\n# Define function constants for Fresh and Compromised state checks\nconst Fresh: Function;\nconst Compromised: Function;\n\n# Define the protocol 'kaochow' with initiator (I), responder (R), and server (S)\nprotocol kaochow(I,R,S)\n{\n    role I  # Initiator role\n    {\n        fresh ni: Nonce;

The purpose of this protocol is to authenticate `I` and `R` to each other with the help of `S`, and to establish a shared session key `kir` between `I` and `R`.\n\n#### Roles:\n\n- **Initiator (`I`):**\n  - **Variables:**\n    - `ni`: a fresh nonce generated by `I`\n    - `nr`: a nonce received from `R`\n    - `kir`: a session key received from `R`\n  - **Steps:**\n    1. `I` sends a message to `S` containing its identity (`I`), identity of `R`, and the nonce `ni`.\n    2. `I` receives a message from `R`, containing the encrypted tuple `{I, R, ni, kir}` with `k(I,S)`, the encrypted nonce `{ni}` with `kir`, and the nonce `nr`.\n    3. `I` sends a message to `R` containing the encrypted nonce `{nr}` with `kir`.\n  - **Claims:**\n    - `Nisynch`: Claims synchronization with `R`.\n    - `Niagree`: Claims agreement on the session key and nonces.\n    - `Secret`: Asserts that `kir` is kept secret.\n    - `Empty`: Asserts properties regarding freshness of `kir`.\n\n- **Responder (`R`):**\n  - **Variables:**\n    - `ni`: a nonce received from `I`\n    - `nr`: a fresh nonce generated by `R`\n    - `kir`: a session key received from `S`\n    - `T`: a variable representing a temporary or unknown value\n  - **Steps:**\n    1. `R` receives a message from `S` containing identities (unknown variable `T`), and the encrypted tuple `{I, R, ni, kir}` with `k(R,S)`.\n    2. `R` sends a message to `I` containing the identities, the encrypted nonce `{ni}` with `kir`, and `nr`.\n    3. `R` receives a message from `I` containing the encrypted nonce `{nr}` with `kir`.\n  - **Claims:**\n    - `Nisynch`: Claims synchronization with `I`.\n    - `Niagree`: Claims agreement on the session key and nonces.\n    - `Secret`: Asserts that `kir` is kept secret.\n    - `Empty`: Asserts properties regarding freshness of `kir`.\n\n- **Server (`S`):**\n  - **Variables:**\n    - `ni`: a nonce received from `I`\n    - `kir`: a fresh session key generated by `S`\n  - **Steps:**\n    1. `S` receives a message from `I` containing identities and `ni`.\n    2. `S` sends a message to `R` containing the encrypted tuples `{I, R, ni, kir}` with `k(I,S)` and `{I, R, ni, kir}` with `k(R,S)`.\n\n---\n\nThe description provided aims to capture the essence of the defined protocol, specifying roles, messages, and security claims.

This description should equip you with enough details to reconstruct a corresponding SPDL file that can be executed by the Scyther tool.\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Name: Needham-Schroeder Public Key Protocol**\n\n**Purpose**: \nThe Needham-Schroeder Public Key protocol is designed to allow two parties, an initiator (I) and a responder (R), to authenticate each other using public key cryptography. There is a server (S) involved for the initial distribution of public keys.\n\n**Roles**: \n\n1. **Initiator (I)**: \n    - Generates a fresh nonce `Ni` for the session.\n    - Initiates the communication and authenticates with responder R using its public key.\n    - Claims that the nonces exchanged (Ni, Nr) are secret and that they have achieved synchronization.\n\n2. **Responder (R)**: \n    - Generates its own fresh nonce `Nr`.\n    - Responds to the initiator\u2019s challenge with its own nonce.\n    - Claims that both nonces are secret and that they have achieved synchronization.\n\n3. **Server (S)**:\n    - Acts as a directory service, providing the public keys of the communicants involved at the start of the session.\n    - Does not keep state about the communications beyond providing the public keys.\n\n**Protocol Steps**:\n\n1. **I -> S : (I, R)**\n   - The initiator asks the server for the public key of R by sending its identity and R\u2019s identity to S.\n\n2. **S -> I : {pk(R), R}sk(S)**\n   - The server sends I the public key of R, signed with the server's private key for authenticity.\n\n3. **I -> R : {Ni, I}pk(R)**\n   - The initiator sends a message to R containing a fresh nonce `Ni` and its own identity, both encrypted with R\u2019s public key.\n\n4. **R -> S : (R, I)**\n   - R requests the public key of I from the server, including both party identities.\n\n5. **S -> R : {pk(I), I}sk(S)**\n   - The server sends R the public key of I, signed with S's private key.\n\n6. **R -> I : {Ni, Nr}pk(I)**\n   - R sends back to I the nonce `Ni` together with its own freshly generated nonce `Nr`, encrypted with I\u2019s public key.\n\n7. **I -> R : {Nr}pk(R)**\n   - I acknowledges the receipt of `Nr` by sending it back to R, encrypted with R\u2019s public key.\n\n**Security Claims**:\n- **For I**:\n  - Claim secrets on the nonces `Ni` and `Nr` and assert synchronization with R.\n- **For R**:\n  - Claim secrets on `Nr` and `Ni` and assert synchronization with I.\n\n**Notes**:\n- The modeling does not include persistent storage of public keys between sessions. The server S acts merely as a key distributor.\n- The protocol assumes that key distribution by the server is secure and resistant to replay.\n- The protocol does not specify a mechanism for key revocation or for authenticating the initial key distribution step.\n\n---\n\nBy following the above description, you can reconstruct the SPDL file for use with Scyther.

The protocol specification also includes auxiliary functionalities to support Diffie-Hellman operations and swap operations through the `DH` and `SWAP` roles.\n\n### Hash Functions\n\n- `prf`: Pseudo-random function, though its specifics are not directly defined or used in the roles mentioned.\n- `KDF`: Key Derivation Function, used to derive keys from shared secrets.\n- `g`: A hash function used in combination with `Diffie-Hellman` values.\n- `h`: Another hash function used to hash combined Diffie-Hellman and nonce values.\n- `MAC`: A hash function used to create Message Authentication Codes for validation of messages.\n\n### Protocols and Roles\n\n#### Protocol `@oracle (DH, SWAP)`\n\n##### Role `DH`\nThis role is designed to model Diffie-Hellman communication:\n\n- **Variables**: \n  - `i, r`: Nonces representing ephemeral Diffie-Hellman exponents.\n- **Protocol Actions**:\n  - **Receive** a message combining the hashed result of a Diffie-Hellman operation as `h(g(r),i)`.\n  - **Send** back the partner message `h(g(i),r)` after performing similar operations with own nonces.\n\n##### Role `SWAP`\nModels a key swap with derived keys:\n\n- **Variables**: \n  - `i, r, Ni, Nr`: Nonces for operations.\n- **Protocol Actions**:\n  - **Receive** and **Send** messages containing key values derived by a `Key Derivation Function (KDF)` from hashed values of combined nonces.\n\n#### Protocol `@executability(O)`\n\n##### Role `O`\nUsed for message authentication validation using MAC:\n\n- **Variables**:\n  - `i, r`: Nonces involved in operations.\n- **Protocol Actions**:\n  - **MAC** used over combinations of hash values and public keys in received and sent messages to ensure that they are authentic and integral.\n\n### Core Protocol `sts-mac(I, R)`\n\n#### Role `I` (Initiator)\nHandles the key exchange initiation:\n\n- **Variables**:\n  - `fresh i`: Fresh nonce generated by `I`.\n  - `Gr`: Placeholder for a gr aparther's Public Key, received from `R`.\n- **Protocol Actions**:\n  - **Send** the exponential of `i` (`g(i)`) to `R`.\n  - **Receive** a response from `R` containing:\n    - The counterpart's exponentiated value, `Gr`.\n    - Signed hash message with `R`'s key.\n    - MAC for authentication.\n  - **Send** back signed message and MAC to `R`.\n  - **Claims**:\n    - `SKR`: Establishes a shared key derived via `KDF(h(Gr,i))`.\n    - `Alive`: Ensures that `I` is part of the execution and alive.\n    - `Weakagree`: Ensure weak agreement on the protocol execution.\n\n#### Role `R` (Responder)\nResponds to the key exchange initiation:\n\n- **Variables**:\n  - `fresh r`: Fresh nonce generated by `R`.\n  - `Gi`: Placeholder for initiator's public key value (`g(i)`), received from `I`.\n- **Protocol Actions**:\n  - **Receive** the initiator's exponential value `Gi`.\n  - **Send** a response to `I` containing:\n    - The responder's exponential value `g(r)`.\n    - A signature of sender's public key and `Gi`.\n    - A MAC for validation.\n  - **Receive** from `I`, verify the signed key and MAC.\n  - **Claims**:\n    - `SKR`: Establishes a shared key via `KDF(h(Gi,r))`.\n    - `Alive`: Ensures the role `R` is active during the protocol execution.\n    - `Weakagree`: Ensures the weak agreement on the shared state.\n\n### Execution Flow \n\n1. The initiator `I` starts the protocol by sending their Diffie-Hellman nonce exponentiation `g(i)`.\n2. The responder `R` replies with their Diffie-Hellman component, signature, and MAC protected message.\n3. The initiator verifies the MAC and sends back a signed, MAC protected confirmation.\n4. Both parties verify each other\u2019s messages and derive a shared secret using the KDF in conjunction with their private nonces and perceived public keys shared during the communication.\n\nThis setup presupposes the existence of appropriate key management and secure random number generation facilities. \n\n### Security Claims\n\nThese security claims specify properties that should hold if the protocol is correctly implemented:\n\n- **`SKR`**: This claim ensures that both parties have derived the same session key at the end of the exchange.\n- **`Alive`**: This claim checks that each role participated in the protocol as expected.\n- **`Weakagree`**: An assertion checking for minimal agreement on exchanged data between roles.\n\nThe description forms a comprehensive understanding of the `sts-mac` protocol and assures that it can effectively verify and maintain secure communications using the Scyther tool."]]}, "SPDL-1/tmn-2.spdl": {"code": [[true, "usertype Key;\n\n// Defining the functions for key handling\nconst pk: Function;\nsecret sk: Function;\ninversekeys(pk,sk);\n\n// Defining the tmn protocol with three roles: A, B, and S (Server)\nprotocol tmn(A,B,S)\n{\n\trole A\n\t{\n\t\t// Fresh key generated by A\n\t\tfresh Ka: Key;\n\t\t// Key variable to be received from B\n\t\tvar Kb: Key;\n\n\t\t// A sends its fresh key to S encrypted with S's public key\n\t\tsend_1(A,S, B,{Ka}pk(S) );\n\t\t// A receives B's fresh key encrypted with A's fresh key\n\t\trecv_4(S,A, B,{Kb}Ka );\n\n\t\t// A's claims about the secrecy of keys\n\t\tclaim_5(A,Secret,Ka); // Claim about own fresh key\n\t\tclaim_8(A,Secret,Kb); // Claim about B's fresh key received\n\t}\t\n\t\n\trole B\n\t{\n\t\t// Fresh key generated by B\n\t\tfresh Kb: Key;\n\n\t\t// B expects a message from S, acting as a relay\n\t\trecv_2(S,B, A );\n\t\t// B sends its fresh key to S encrypted with S's public key\n\t\tsend_3(B,S, A, { Kb }pk(S) );\n\n\t\t// B's claim about the secrecy of its fresh key\n\t\tclaim_6(B,Secret,Kb);\n\t}\n\n\trole S\n\t{\n\t\t// Key variables for keys from A and B\n\t\tvar Ka,Kb: Key;\n\n\t\t// S receives A's fresh key encrypted with its public key\n\t\trecv_1(A,S, B,{Ka}pk(S) );\n\t\t// S acknowledges B, relaying part of the protocol process\n\t\tsend_2(S,B, A );\n\t\t// S receives B's fresh key encrypted with its public key\n\t\trecv_3(B,S, A, { Kb }pk(S) );\n\t\t// S sends B's fresh key to A, encrypted with A's fresh key\n\t\tsend_4(S,A, B,{Kb}Ka );\n\n\t\t// S's claim about the secrecy of A's fresh key\n\t\tclaim_7(S,Secret,Ka);\n\t}\n}\n\n// Additional agents for the protocol\nconst Alice,Bob,Eve,Simon: Agent;", "Below is the modified version of your SPDL file with the added annotations.

The protocol is designed to establish a shared session key between the Initiator and the Responder with the assistance of the Server. Here's a detailed description based on the SPDL specification:\n\n### Parties Involved:\n- **Initiator (I):** The party that begins the protocol execution to establish a session key with the Responder.\n- **Responder (R):** The party that cooperates with the Initiator to establish the session key.\n- **Server (S):** A trusted server that helps in generating the session key for the Initiator and the Responder.\n\n### Key Materials:\n- **SessionKey (Kir):** A fresh session key generated by the Server for use between I and R.\n- **Nonce (Ni, Nr):** Nonces generated by I and R, respectively, to ensure the freshness of the protocol messages.\n- **Ticket (T):** A cryptographic construct provided by the server that allows R to derive the session key.\n\n### Protocol Messages:\n1. **Message 1:** `I -> R : I, Ni`\n   - The Initiator (I) sends its identity and a fresh nonce (Ni) to the Responder (R).\n\n2. **Message 2:** `R -> S : R, {I, Ni, Nr}k(R,S)`\n   - The Responder generates a fresh nonce (Nr) and sends it along with the Initiator's identity and nonce (I, Ni) to the Server (S). This message is encrypted with a pre-shared key between R and S (k(R,S)).\n\n3. **Message 3:** `S -> I : {R, Kir, Ni, Nr}k(I,S), {I, Kir}k(R,S)`\n   - The Server issues a session key (Kir) and forms a message with the Responder's identity (R), the session key (Kir), and the nonces (Ni, Nr). This message is encrypted with the key shared between I and S (k(I,S)).\n   - Additionally, the Server sends a ticket (T = {I, Kir}k(R,S)) to I, encrypted with the key shared between R and S. This ticket allows R to derive the session key.\n\n4. **Message 4:** `I -> R : T, {Nr}Kir`\n   - The Initiator sends the ticket (T) to the Responder along with the nonce (Nr) encrypted with the session key (Kir). This confirms to R that I has the correct session key.\n\n### Security Goals:\n- **Secret Goal for I and R:** Both I and R can claim that the established session key (Kir) is a secret and not known by anyone else except themselves and the trusted Server.\n- **Nonce Security for S:** The Server claims that the nonces Ni and Nr used in the protocol are kept secret.\n\n### Claims:\n- `claim_I1(I, Secret, Kir)`: After sending message 4, I claims that Kir is a secret shared with R.\n- `claim_R1(R, Secret, Kir)`: Upon receiving message 4, R claims that Kir is a secret shared with I.\n- `claim(S, Secret, Ni)`, `claim(S, Secret, Nr)`: S claims that the nonces Ni and Nr are kept confidential throughout the protocol execution.\n\nThis protocol assumes that pre-shared keys exist between I & S and R & S, which are used for initial secure communications.

Here's a detailed description of the protocol based on the SPDL file:\n\n### Protocol Overview\nThe HMQV (HMQV-twopass) protocol is designed to establish a shared key between two parties, denoted as `I` (Initiator) and `R` (Responder), using a two-pass message exchange. The protocol uses Diffie-Hellman key exchange principles, combined with additional hash and key derivation functions to authenticate both parties and establish a shared secret.\n\n### Hash and Mathematical Functions\n- **Hash Functions**: `h1`, `h2`, `KDF`, `H` are cryptographic hash functions used for various transformations.\n- **Exponential Functions**: `gexp`, `exp` are used for exponentiation related to Diffie-Hellman.\n- **Arithmetic Functions**: `add`, `mult` are represented as hash functions but denote arithmetic operations such as addition and multiplication.\n\n### Roles\n1. **Initiator (I)**:\n   - Generates a fresh nonce `x`.\n   - Computes `gexp(x)` and sends it to `R`.\n   - Receives `Y` from `R`.\n   - Computes shared key as `KDF(exp(mult(Y, exp(gexp(sk(R)), H(Y, I))), add(x, mult(H(gexp(x), R), sk(I)))))`.\n   - Claims the successful establishment of the session key (SKR).\n\n2. **Responder (R)**:\n   - Generates a fresh nonce `y`.\n   - Receives `X` from `I`.\n   - Computes `gexp(y)` and sends it back to `I`.\n   - Computes shared key as `KDF(exp(mult(X, exp(gexp(sk(I)), H(X, R))), add(y, mult(H(gexp(y), I), sk(R)))))`.\n   - Claims the successful establishment of the session key (SKR).\n\n### Support Protocols\nThe SPDL file includes several specialized helper protocols to facilitate certain operations or simulate certain network conditions:\n- **@publickeys(PK):** Simulates public knowledge of public keys.\n- **@exponentiation(RA, RB, RC):** Ensures the correct order of exponentiation.\n- **@addmult(I, R):** Handles ordering for add and mult operations.\n- **@keyswap(I, R):** Simulates the key exchange between two parties using a combination of exponentiation and other cryptographic operations.\n\n### Security Claims\nBoth roles in the protocol make security claims (`claim(I, SKR, ...)` and `claim(R, SKR, ...)`) asserting that they have established a secure session key using the derived shared secret.\n\nThis description captures the key elements and flow of the HMQV-twopass protocol as defined in the given SPDL file.

These protocols are based on the ISO/IEC 9798 standard for entity authentication using symmetric cryptography. \n\n### Protocol Overview\n\n#### Protocol: `@keysymm-21(A,B)`\n\nThis is a symmetric, one-pass, unilateral authentication protocol described in two roles: `A` and `B`. The protocol is a model inspired by the ISO/IEC 9798 standards, as described by Cas Cremers in December 2010.\n\n- **Role `A`**:\n  - The initiator `A` waits to receive a message from `B` that includes a nonce `T`, identifier `A`, and a text `Text` encrypted with the symmetric key `k(A,B)`.\n  - Upon receiving this message, `A` replies to `B` with the same message components but encrypted with the key `k(B,A)`.\n\n- **Role `B`**:\n  - The responder `B` waits to receive a message from `A` including a nonce `T`, its identifier `B`, and a text `Text` encrypted with the key `k(A,B)`.\n  - Upon receiving, `B` sends back the same message components encrypted with the key `k(B,A)`.\n\n#### Protocol: `isoiec-9798-2-1(A,B)`\n\nThis protocol is another version modeled after the ISO/IEC 9798 standard, providing data origin authentication and entity authentication through a single message from `A` to `B`. It involves roles for `A` and `B` with nonce generation and use of claims to describe security properties.\n\n- **Role `A`**:\n  - Generates fresh nonce `TNA` and fresh tickets `Text1` and `Text2`.\n  - Makes a claim that it is running the protocol with `B`, providing `TNA` and `Text1`.\n  - Sends a message to `B` consisting of `Text2` and the nonce-text pair encrypted with `B`'s key `k(A,B)`.\n\n- **Role `B`**:\n  - Upon receiving a message from `A`, `B` retrieves `TNA`, `Text1`, and `Text2`.\n  - `B` then makes several claims: it has committed with `A` by acknowledging receipt of `TNA` and `Text1`, is alive (indicating participation in the protocol), and has weak agreement with `A`.\n\n### Security Claims\n\n- **Running**: Initiating party (`A`) is running the protocol and expecting certain behavior from `B`.\n- **Commit**: The responding party (`B`) acknowledges the completion of the protocol session with intended parameters.\n- **Alive**: Verification that the role is actively involved in the communication.\n- **Weakagree**: A weaker version of agreement which may not ensure message integrity or source confirmation to the usual extent.\n\nThese protocols leverage symmetric key encryption to provide authentication, with potential variations as noted regarding the identity of `B`. These SPDL descriptions can be used in Scyther to analyze different security properties and potential vulnerabilities through formal verification."]]}, "SPDL-1/KAS1.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/* \n * KEA+\n *\n * From \"Security Analysis of KEA Authenticated Key Exchange Protocol\"\n * Lauter, Mityagin, 2006.\n * \n * We find no attacks in CK if only the ephemeral key is revealed.\n * We do find attacks for both roles in CK if the input to hash1 is\n * revealed.\n */\n\n// Hash functions\nhashfunction h1,h2,g1,g2;\n\n// Protocol for equivalence of public keys and exponential computation\nprotocol @publickeys(RA,RB,RC)\n{\n\trole RA\n\t{\n\t\t// RA generates and sends public key equivalent message\n\t\tsend_!1(RA,RA, g1(sk(RA)) );\n\t}\n\trole RB\n\t{\n\t\t// Special role to handle Diffie-Hellman (DH) calculations\n\t\tvar T: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// Receive operation with Diffie-Hellman shared secrets\n\t\trecv_!2(RB,RB, g2(g1(T),sk(RB)) );\n\t\t// Send public key information related to DH\n\t\tsend_!3(RB,RB, g2(pk(RB),T) );\n\t}\n\trole RC\n\t{\n\t\t// Special role to handle Diffie-Hellman (DH) calculations\n\t\tvar T: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// Receive operation with public key equivalent\n\t\trecv_!4(RC,RC, g2(pk(RC),T) );\n\t\t// Send operation with shared secret calculation using DH\n\t\tsend_!5(RC,RC, g2(g1(T),sk(RC)) );\n\t}\n}\n\n// Protocol to simulate g^ab = g^ba\nprotocol @exponentiation(RA,RB,RC)\n{\n\trole RA\n\t{\n\t\t// Variables for Ticket abstraction\n\t\tvar alpha,beta, T1,T2: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// Receive and send operations to handle symmetric key exchange simulation\n\t\trecv_!1(RA,RA, g2(g1(T1),T2) );\n\t\tsend_!2(RA,RA, g2(g1(T2),T1) );\n\t}\n\trole RB\n\t{\n\t\t// Ticket variables for message handling\n\t\tvar T1,T2,T3: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// Handling incoming messages with hash application\n\t\trecv_!3(RB,RB, h1(g2(g1(T1),T2),T3,RC,RB) );\n\t\t// Respond with hashed content using altered tickets\n\t\tsend_!4(RB,RB, h1(g2(g1(T2),T1),T3,RC,RB) );\n\t}\n\trole RC\n\t{\n\t\t// Ticket variables for book-keeping\n\t\tvar T1,T2,T3: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// Handle cryptographic hash function with tickets\n\t\trecv_!5(RC,RC, h1(T3,g2(g1(T1),T2),RC,RA) );\n\t\t// Sending result of restructured keys with hash\n\t\tsend_!6(RC,RC, h1(T3,g2(g1(T2),T1),RC,RA) );\n\t}\n}\n\n// Main protocol description for KEA+\nprotocol KEAplus(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\t// Nonce 'x' generation and sending it as part of the protocol\n\t\tfresh x: Nonce;\n\t\tvar beta: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// Compromise assumptions for insider risks\n\t\tsend_Compromise(I,I, x);\n\t\t// Initial handshake from Initiator to Responder\n\t\tsend_1(I,R, g1(x) );\n\t\t// Receiving transformed ticket from Responder\n\t\trecv_2(R,I, beta );\n\n\t\t// Security claim for the initiator's view of the session key\n\t\tclaim(I,SKR, h1(\n\t\t  g2(beta,sk(I)),\n\t\t  g2(pk(R),x),\n\t\t  I,R\n\t\t));\n\t}\t\n\t\n\trole R\n\t{\n\t\t// Nonce generation from responder-side\n\t\tfresh y: Nonce;\n\t\tvar alpha: Ticket;\n\n\t\t// Receiving initiator's message\n\t\trecv_1(I,R, alpha );\n\t\t// Compromise handling\n\t\tsend_Compromise(R,R, y);\n\t\t// Responding to the initiator with its own contribution\n\t\tsend_2(R,I, g1(y) );\n\n\t\t// Security claim for the responder's view of the session key\n\t\tclaim(R,SKR, h1(\n\t\t  g2(pk(I),y),\n\t\t  g2(alpha,sk(R)),\n\t\t  I,R\n\t\t));\n\t}\n}", "Certainly!

Below is a detailed description of the protocol, which can help recreate the SPDL file to be used with the Scyther tool.\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nThe KEA+ protocol is a cryptographic scheme designed to allow two parties, an initiator (I) and a responder (R), to securely exchange keys. This protocol is based on Diffie-Hellman principles and integrates hash functions for authentication. The key concept here is to ensure that each party can generate the same session key independently while ensuring that any compromised data does not lead to key disclosure.\n\n### Protocol Elements\n\n- **Roles**: The protocol involves two primary roles:\n  - **Initiator (I)**: Begins the communication, generates a nonce (`x`), and utilizes it for key generation.\n  - **Responder (R)**: Responds to the initiator, generates its own nonce (`y`), and completes the key exchange process.\n\n- **Messages**:\n  - The initiator sends an initial message with a public key derived from its nonce.\n  - The responder replies with its public key, allowing each party to calculate a shared session key.\n\n- **Security Claims**: Both parties make security claims about the confidentiality of the session key they derive from the exchange, specified using the `claim` construct.\n\n### Supporting Protocols\n\nThe file also contains auxiliary protocols, denoted with an \"@\" prefix, which aid in simulating certain cryptographic properties:\n\n- **@publickeys Protocol**: Simulates the association of public keys with the powers of primitives. Three roles (RA, RB, RC) are used here to facilitate a setup where \"public keys\" are generated and can be sent across parties.\n\n- **@exponentiation Protocol**: Utilized to simulate the commutativity of Diffie-Hellman key exchanges, where the shared secret `g^ab` equals `g^ba`. It includes roles RA, RB, and RC to conduct these simulations.\n\n### Hash Functions\n\nFour hash functions are defined:\n\n- `h1` and `h2`: Probably used for hashing intermediary values, ensuring both integrity and confidentiality.\n- `g1` and `g2`: Functions used for key derivation steps.\n\n### Protocol Execution\n\n1. **Initiator Role (I)**:\n   - Generates a fresh nonce `x`.\n   - Sends a commitment of `x` to itself using `send_Compromise`.\n   - Transmits a message consisting of `g1(x)` to the responder.\n   - Receives a `beta` value from the responder.\n   - Claims that the computed session key (`SKR`) using `h1` is secure.\n\n2. **Responder Role (R)**:\n   - Generates a fresh nonce `y`.\n   - Sends a commitment of `y` to itself.\n   - Receives an `alpha` value from the initiator.\n   - Sends a message consisting of `g1(y)` back to the initiator.\n   - Claims that its computation of the session key mirrors that of the initiator, made secure by the same `h1`.\n\n### Security Properties\n\nThe KEA+ aims to ensure the shared session key's secrecy and authenticity, even when parts of the ephemeral keys may be exposed.

Here's a description of the protocol structured in a way such that one could recreate the SPDL file:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Name\n**NAXOS AKE (Authenticated Key Exchange) Protocol**\n\n### Description\nNAXOS is an authenticated key exchange protocol designed to provide strong security properties. It was modeled by Cas Cremers in 2009 based on the work \"Stronger Security of Authenticated Key Exchange\" by LaMacchia, Lauter, and Mityagin in 2006.\n\n### Key Features\n- **Hash Functions**: The protocol utilizes two different hash functions `h1` and `h2`.\n- **Exponentiation Operator**: Modeled as a one-way function using the hash function `p`.\n- **Generator**: A constant `g` is used for key generation purposes.\n\n### Procedures\n\n#### 1. Public Key Simulation\nA helper protocol `@publickeys` simulates public knowledge of public keys using role `PK`. It broadcasts the public key, which is a hashed value of constant generator `g` raised to a secret `sk(PK)` (private key of PK).\n\n#### 2. Exponentiation Approximation\nTo approximate the equational theory \\( g^{ab} = g^{ba} \\), the helper protocol `@exponentiation` is used with roles `RA`, `RB`, and `RC`. These roles simulate the swapping of exponents in \\( h2 \\) hash function terms.\n\n#### 3. Key Symmetry\nThe protocol `@keysymmetry` with roles `R1`, `R2`, and `R3` verifies properties that maintain symmetric knowledge of shared keys, similar in logic to exponentiation approximation, ensuring both communicating parties agree on the session key.\n\n### Main Protocol Roles\n\n#### Initiator Role (I)\n- **Step 1**: Initiator `I` chooses a fresh ephemeral session key `eskI` and sends \\( p(g, h1(eskI, sk(I))) \\) to responder `R`.\n- **Step 3**: Upon receiving \\( Y \\), the Initiator makes a claim of shared session key `SKR` by computing:\n  - `p(Y, sk(I))`\n  - `p(p(g, sk(R)), h1(eskI, sk(I)))`\n  - `p(Y, h1(eskI, sk(I)))`\n  - Along with identities `I` and `R`.\n\n#### Responder Role (R)\n- **Step 2**: Responder `R` receives the initiator's message `X` and replies with \\( p(g, h1(eskR, sk(R))) \\) where `eskR` is a fresh ephemeral session key.\n- **Step 4**: After sending the message, `R` claims shared session key `SKR` by computing:\n  - `p(p(g, sk(I)), h1(eskR, sk(R)))`\n  - `p(X, sk(R))`\n  - `p(X, h1(eskR, sk(R)))`\n  - Along with identities `I` and `R`.\n\n### Security Claims\n- Both roles `I` and `R` claim to derive a shared session key securely (`SKR`) based on the session descriptions and computations.\n\n### Attack Scenarios\n- The protocol as modeled allows for analyzing the state-reveal with automatic state inference to uncover potential attacks on both initiator and responder roles.\n\n---\n\nThis description embodies the crucial structural details of the NAXOS AKE protocol, allowing someone to reconstruct the protocol's SPDL file for use in Scyther."]]}, "SPDL-1/nsl3.spdl": {"code": [[true, "/* \n * Needham-Schroeder-Lowe protocol\n * Analyzed with Scyther\n * Participants: Initiator (I), Responder (R)\n * Main Purpose: Mutual authentication\n */\n\n// The protocol description\n\nprotocol nsl3(I,R)\n{\n\trole I\n\t{\n\t\tfresh ni: Nonce; // Fresh nonce generated by Initiator I\n\t\tvar nr: Nonce;   // Nonce generated by Responder R\n\n\t\tsend_1(I,R, {I,ni}pk(R) ); // I sends its identity and nonce ni, encrypted with R's public key\n\t\trecv_2(R,I, {ni,nr,R}pk(I) ); // I receives a message containing both nonces ni, nr and R's identity, encrypted with I's public key\n\t\tsend_3(I,R, {nr}pk(R) ); // I sends the nonce nr back to R, encrypted with R's public key\n\n\t\tclaim_i1(I,Secret,ni); // I claims ni is kept secret (internal assertion)\n\t\tclaim_i2(I,Secret,nr); // I claims nr is kept secret\n\t\tclaim_i3(I,Niagree);   // Nonce agreement: I agrees on nonce with R\n\t\tclaim_i4(I,Nisynch);   // Synchronization: I agrees on message sequence with R\n\t}\t\n\t\n\trole R\n\t{\n\t\tvar ni: Nonce; // Nonce generated by Initiator I\n\t\tfresh nr: Nonce; // Fresh nonce generated by Responder R\n\n\t\trecv_1(I,R, {I,ni}pk(R) ); // R receives a message containing I's identity and nonce ni, encrypted with R's public key\n\t\tsend_2(R,I, {ni,nr,R}pk(I) ); // R sends the received nonce ni, its new nonce nr, and its own identity, encrypted with I's public key\n\t\trecv_3(I,R, {nr}pk(R) ); // R receives its nonce nr back from I, encrypted with R's public key\n\n\t\tclaim_r1(R,Secret,ni); // R claims ni is kept secret\n\t\tclaim_r2(R,Secret,nr); // R claims nr is kept secret\n\t\tclaim_r3(R,Niagree);   // Nonce agreement: R agrees on nonce with I\n\t\tclaim_r4(R,Nisynch);   // Synchronization: R agrees on message sequence with I\n\t}\n}", "Certainly!

Below is a breakdown of the protocol, including details on the roles, messages exchanged, and the security properties claimed in each role. Following this description, an equivalent SPDL file can be reconstructed.\n\n### Protocol Entities\n- **Initiator (I):** The party initiating the protocol.\n- **Responder (R):** The party responding to the initiator.\n\n### Cryptographic Assumptions\n- `pk(X)`: Represents the public key of entity X.\n- Nonces (`ni`, `nr`): Random numbers used to ensure freshness of the communication.\n\n### Messages\n1. **Message 1 (send_1):** The initiator sends to the responder a message encrypted with the responder's public key. This message contains the initiator's identity and a freshly generated nonce (`ni`).\n   - `send_1(I,R, {I,ni}pk(R) )`\n\n2. **Message 2 (recv_2, send_2):** The responder decrypts the message, retrieves the nonce, attaches a freshly generated nonce (`nr`), and their own identity, encrypts everything with the initiator's public key, and sends it back to the initiator.\n   - `recv_2(R,I, {ni,nr,R}pk(I) )`\n   - `send_2(R,I, {ni,nr,R}pk(I) )`\n\n3. **Message 3 (recv_3, send_3):** The initiator decrypts the message, retrieves both nonces, encrypts the nonce `nr` with the responder's public key, and sends it back to the responder, confirming the receipt of the message.\n   - `recv_3(I,R, {nr}pk(R) )`\n   - `send_3(I,R, {nr}pk(R) )`\n\n### Security Claims\n\n#### Initiator's Claims:\n- `claim_i1(I,Secret,ni)`: The nonce `ni` should remain a secret.\n- `claim_i2(I,Secret,nr)`: The nonce `nr` should remain a secret.\n- `claim_i3(I,Niagree)`: Nonce `ni` agreement with the responder.\n- `claim_i4(I,Nisynch)`: Synchronization indication that both nonces have been agreed upon.\n\n#### Responder's Claims:\n- `claim_r1(R,Secret,ni)`: The nonce `ni` should remain a secret.\n- `claim_r2(R,Secret,nr)`: The nonce `nr` should remain a secret.\n- `claim_r3(R,Niagree)`: Nonce `nr` agreement with the initiator.\n- `claim_r4(R,Nisynch)`: Synchronization indication that both nonces have been agreed upon.\n\n### Process Description\nThis protocol aims to establish mutual authentication between I and R.

The protocol includes mechanisms for signature verification to ensure authenticity of the messages exchanged between the initiating party (denoted as `I`) and the responding party (denoted as `R`). Let's break down the components and the flow of this protocol:\n\n1. **Preliminaries**:\n   - The protocol utilizes hash functions `h1`, `h2`, `g1`, and `g2`. These hash functions are theoretical primitives used for various cryptographic operations within the protocol.\n   - A helper protocol named `@exponentiation` simulates the commutative property of exponentiation in the Diffie-Hellman exchange, specifically the equivalence of `g^ab = g^ba`. This helper is denoted by the `@` symbol and is used solely for internal processes like display or debugging in Scyther.\n\n2. **Roles**:\n   - The two main roles in the protocol are the Initiator (`I`) and the Responder (`R`).\n\n3. **Initiator Role (`I`)**:\n   - Begins by generating a fresh nonce `s` and another nonce `x` for engaging in the cryptographic exchange process.\n   - Sends a message (`send_1`) consisting of its own identity `I`, the session nonce `s`, and the public component `g1(x)` to the Responder `R`.\n   - Awaits a response (`recv_2`) from `R`, containing `R`'s identity, the nonce `s`, a ticket `beta` and a signature from `R`.\n   - Sends back a message (`send_3`) containing its signature to authenticate the exchange and finalize the session.\n   - Claims to have established a session key (`SKR`) based on the Diffie-Hellman derived key `g2(beta, x)`.\n\n4. **Responder Role (`R`)**:\n   - Generates its own fresh nonce `y`.\n   - Receives an initial message (`recv_1`) from `I`, extracting the nonce `s` and a ticket `alpha`.\n   - Asserts a claim over the session identity (`SID`) based on the nonce `s`.\n   - Responds to `I` with a message (`send_2`) that includes its identity `R`, nonce `s`, a derived public component `g1(y)`, and a signature to ensure legitimacy.\n   - Upon receiving the final message from `I` (`recv_3`), checks for the signed integrity of the session exchange.\n   - Finally, it declares a session key claim (`SKR`) based on the shared key `g2(alpha, y)`.\n\n5. **Security Claims**:\n   - Both roles (`I` and `R`) make security claims using Scyther primitives: `SID` for session initiation security and `SKR` for session key establishment security.\n\nThe purpose of this protocol is to securely establish a shared session key between two parties using Diffie-Hellman principles enhanced with signature verification to prevent impersonation and other man-in-the-middle attacks. The signatures (`sk(I)` and `sk(R)`) added to the payloads address authenticity issues by ensuring that the messages were generated by the legitimate owner of the respective keys.\n\nBased on this description, one should be able to write the corresponding SPDL file, which maintains the defined roles, messages, and claims necessary for Scyther to analyze the security properties of the protocol.

Let me provide a detailed description of this protocol based on the given SPDL code. This description will help us to understand the procedure and logic within the protocol's roles and messages.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Overview\nThe SKEME Basic protocol facilitates secure communication between two roles, Initiator (I) and Responder (R), using cryptographic primitives to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and authentication. The protocol employs nonce-based challenges, Diffie-Hellman key exchange, and pseudo-random functions (PRF) to achieve key agreement and mutual authentication.\n\n#### Cryptographic Functions\n- **PRF**: A pseudo-random function used for generating keys or tokens.\n- **KDF**: Key Derivation Function, applied to transform shared secrets into encryption keys.\n- **g, h**: Hash functions applied for various cryptographic operations.\n- **pk(X)**: Public key of role X, used for encrypting messages.\n- **{M}pk(X)**: Encryption of message M with the public key of role X.\n\n#### Roles and Messages\n\n1. **DH Role**: \n   - Utilizes the Diffie-Hellman key exchange mechanism to derive a shared key.\n   - Process starts with receiving a calcualted value and then responding with another calculated value.\n\n2. **SWAP Role**:\n   - Similar to DH but swaps the received values before processing, ensuring mutual calculation and understanding of derived secrets.\n\n3. **Initiator Role (I)**:\n   - Generates fresh nonces `i` and `Ni`.\n   - Sends a message to `R` containing an encrypted package `{I, Ni}`, the identity and nonce, and a value `g(i)` calculated using the hash function `g`.\n   - Receives from `R` a message containing another nonce `Nr`, a derived ticket `Gr`, and a PRF output that concatenates the nonces and crypto operations.\n   - Sends a final verification step to `R` using PRF for authentication continuity.\n\n4. **Responder Role (R)**:\n   - Generates fresh nonces `r` and `Nr`.\n   - Upon receiving the initial message from `I`, computes the Diffie-Hellman exchange with `Gi` and sends back encrypted nonce `Nr`, the new `g(r)` value, and a layered PRF for validation.\n   - Awaits confirmation from `I` with a final PRF check for verifying mutual authentication.\n\n#### Security Claims\n- **SKR (Shared Key Recognition)**: Ensures both parties derive the same cryptographic keys using shared secrets transformed through KDF and hash functions.\n- **Alive Claim**: Asserts that the roles are successfully participating in the protocol execution.\n- **Weakagree (Weak Agreement)**: Establishes that both parties agree upon the session's key properties and derived session states.\n\n### Summary\nThe SKEME Basic protocol demonstrates a secure exchange through calculated nonces, cryptographic functions, and shared key derivation with specific techniques in PRF and KDF application. Each role is responsible for generating fresh nonces, encrypting communication, and confirming cryptographic consistency. It involves exchange and verification processes ensuring confidentiality and integrity between Initiator and Responder. The structured process and claim implementation generate confidence in the protocol's robustness against potential passive and active attacks."]]}}
