Below is a descriptive summary of the protocol and the key components used in the code:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\nThe protocol focuses on the ElGamal encryption scheme, which is a public-key cryptosystem. The security of this scheme is based on the hardness of the DDH problem, a well-known assumption in cryptography. Here's a breakdown of the components and logic used in the code:\n\n#### Parameters and Types\n- **Parameters**: `n` and `q` are defined as global parameters, which may represent a security parameter and the number of times a process may engage respectively.\n- **Types**: `Z` represents integers (exponents), and `G` represents group elements for a fixed group \\( G \\).\n\n#### Group Operations\n- **exp**: A function `exp(G, Z): G` which computes the exponentiation of a group element.\n- **gamma**: A constant defined as a generator for the group \\( G \\).\n\n#### Security Assumptions\n- **DDH assumption**: The code implements the DDH assumption as an indistinguishability game between two distributions:\n  - Generating exponentiated group elements \\( \\exp(\\gamma, x), \\exp(\\gamma, y), \\exp(\\gamma, xy) \\).\n  - Simulating with \\( \\exp(\\gamma, z) \\) instead of \\( \\exp(\\gamma, xy) \\).\n\n#### Functions and Relationships\n- **mult**: A function that multiplies two elements of type `Z`. The code uses this to model the property that exponentiation in the group is multiplicative.\n- **dot and invdot**: Functions over the group \\( G \\) with properties similar to standard pairing and its inverse. The dot product is a uniform function, while invdot allows retrieval of an original element from a dotted product.\n- **choose**: Implements conditional selection between two group elements based on a Boolean condition, analogous to an \"if-else\" structure.\n\n#### Protocol Logic\n- **Key Generation**: The process begins with a key generation step in which a new exponent `x` is chosen randomly and used to compute a public key component `alpha = exp(gamma, x)`.\n- **Encryption**: The encryption process `processE` takes message pairs `(m0, m1)` and chooses between them based on a secret bit `b`. It computes `beta = exp(gamma, y)` and `delta = exp(alpha, y)`. The ciphertext is a pair `(beta, zeta)`, where `zeta = dot(delta, m)`.\n- **Query**: A query is made to check the secrecy of the bit `b`, ensuring that an adversary cannot distinguish which message was encrypted.\n\n#### Replication and Input/Output Channels\n- Processes use channels (`cPK` for public key transmission, `cE` for encryption requests, and `cEret` for encrypted messages) to synchronize actions. \n- Replication and parallel composition (`!q` and `processE`) allow multiple independent instances of the encryption process.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe code aims to demonstrate that under the DDH assumption, the semantic security of the ElGamal encryption scheme can be formally verified using game transformations and equivalences. The statement \"All queries proved\" in the expected result confirms that the queries about the secrecy of the bit `b` (which determines the encrypted message) are successfully verified, reflecting the security guarantees provided by the protocol when executed in Cryptoverif."]]}, "CV-1/BogdanDennis2.ocv": {"code": [[true, "param n_f, n_x, nK, nF, nx.\n\n(* Interactive mode could help test intermediate stages of the execution, uncomment if needed *)\n(* set interactiveMode = true. *)\n\ntype pkey [bounded].

Below is a detailed description of the protocol based on the provided ocv file. This description attempts to capture the essential elements and logic, which can help regenerate a similar ocv file.\n\n### Protocol Description:\n\n#### Parameters and Types:\n1. **Parameters:**\n   - `n_f`, `n_x`, `nK`, `nF`, `nx`: Integer parameters that define the bounds of iterations in the protocol.\n\n2. **Types:**\n   - `pkey`: Public key type, marked as bounded.\n   - `skey`: Secret key type, marked as bounded.\n   - `seed`: Type marked as large and fixed, used for key generation.\n   - `D`: A type marked as fixed, represents the domain for parts of the protocol.\n\n#### Functions:\n1. **Key Generation Functions:**\n   - `pkgen(seed):pkey`: Generates a public key from a seed.\n   - `skgen(seed):skey`: Generates a secret key from a seed.\n\n2. **Boolean and Transform Functions:**\n   - `B(D):bool`: Maps an element of type `D` to a boolean.\n   - `xor(bool,bool):bool`: Performs an exclusive OR operation on two booleans. It has a commutation equation `commut(xor)` and an identity relation.\n\n3. **Transform and Inverse Transform Functions:**\n   - `f(pkey,D):D` and `f'(pkey, D):D`: Functions that transform an element of type `D` using a public key.\n   - `invf(skey,D):D`: Inverse function that retrieves the original element from its transformed state using a secret key.\n\n4. **Alternate Key Generation Function:**\n   - `pkgen'(seed):pkey`: Alternative public key generation function.\n\n#### Equations and Properties:\n- Certain algebraic properties and equations are defined to guide the protocol behavior, like the inverse nature of `f` and `invf`, and properties of `xor`.\n\n#### Protocol Steps:\n\n1. **Equivalent Statements:**\n   - Describes scenarios of key and data generation, encryption, and the interactions between these elements using structure `equiv`.\n   - Simulates a real-world process (`processRealBob`) that generates keys, secret messages, and uses transformations to return a tuple of elements including a verification boolean `vb` which relies on a secret `b`.\n\n2. **Security Queries:**\n   - The security query `secret b.` checks whether the secret `b` can be proved secure through the process of attempting to hide its value within transformations and reveal this inside the constructed process.\n  \n3. **Process Execution:**\n   - `processRealBob`: The main process which is described in a conditional manner based on the secret bit `b`, managing two different paths depending on the value of `b`.\n   - Uses `xor` operations and checks against transformed domains using the boolean function `B`.\n\n4. **Secrecy Check:**\n   - The cryptoverif tool is employed to check the secrecy of `b`. The expected result indicates that it is unable to prove this secrecy, demonstrating potential vulnerabilities or open areas for analysis.\n\n#### Conclusion:\n\nThis protocol represents a cryptographic scenario where a set of keys and transformed data interact through structured operations. The core intent is to hide a secret bit `b` within a complex interaction of operations, while the tool attempts to verify its secrecy. By understanding these elements and relationships, one can derive the ocv file structure provided. \n\nTo regenerate the ocv file:\n- Structure equivalent statements to simulate real and ideal comparisons.\n- Accurately define types, functions, and equations reflecting their algebraic properties.\n- Implement process structures that embody hypothetical real-world operational flows.\n- Specify security queries to test protocol properties."]]}, "CV-1/otestINDCCA2-v2.ocv": {"code": [[true, "(* Trivial running example for conference paper. *)\n\nparam N.

These types are specified with attributes like `[bounded]`, `[fixed]`, and `[large]`, which define their specific properties.\n\n2. **Functions:**\n   - `keyToBitstring(key):bitstring` is a function that converts a key into a bitstring, marked with the `[compos]` attribute, possibly indicating composability or compatibility with other operations.\n\n3. **Shared-key Encryption Scheme:**\n   - The encryption scheme assumes an IND-CCA2 secure shared-key encryption using stream cipher-style encryption.\n   - `Penc` is defined as a distinguishability probability for encryption, indicating the protocol\u2019s interest in analyzing encryption security.\n   - The protocol expands on this scheme with a cryptographic game indicating secure encryption goals, as per IND-CCA2 standards.\n\n4. **Special Functions:**\n   - `Z` is a function that takes a bitstring and returns a zeroed bitstring of the same length. It's notably used to describe a padding or nullifying function:\n     - A constant `Zkey` is defined as the zeroed version of a `bitstring`.\n     - A rule is defined that for any key `y`, `Z(keyToBitstring(y))` will equal `Zkey`.\n\n5. **Queries:**\n   - The protocol aims to analyze the secrecy of keys `k2` and `k3`, with particular emphasis on short-term secret exposure by querying with `secret1`.\n   - Queries `secret1 k2` and `secret1 k3` test for one-session secrecy.\n   - Queries `secret k2` and `secret k3` aim to assess long-term secrecy across processes.\n\n6. **Process Definitions:**\n   - Two distinct processes `processA` and `processB` are defined:\n     - `processA`: Generates a random key `k2` and a random seed `s1`, then uses an encryption function `enc` to encrypt a message `Kab` using `k2` and `s1`, returning the encrypted message `ea1`.\n     - `processB`: Attempts to decrypt an input bitstring `ea` using the inverse of `enc` (the decryption function `dec`). It checks if the decrypted value matches `k3` and their converted bitstring versions.\n   \n7. **Main Process:**\n   - The `process` block defines the main execution flow with the function `Ostart()`. Initially, a random key seed `rKab` is sampled to generate a key `Kab` using a key generation function `kgen`.\n   - The main process executes two subprocesses in parallel:\n     - A series of `processA` executions, iterated `N` times.\n     - A series of `processB` executions, also iterated `N` times.\n\n8. **Expected Results:**\n   - The expected outcome suggests an inability to prove the secrecy and one-session secrecy of `k3`. The disclaimer highlights a time-stamped result listing execution resources but indicating a vulnerability in the protocol regarding `k3`.\n\nThis description should allow a knowledgeable user to encode the protocol details directly into a cryptographic verification tool like CryptoVerif."]]}, "CV-1/testPRP.cv": {"code": [[true, "(* Trivial running example for conference paper. *)\n\nparam N.\nparam N2.\nparam N3.\n\n(* Types for keys and message authentications *)\ntype mkey [bounded].\ntype mkeyseed [fixed].\ntype key [fixed,large].\ntype keyseed [fixed].\ntype seed [fixed].\ntype macs [bounded].\n\n(* Function to convert key to bitstring for encryption *)\nfun keyToBitstring(key):bitstring [compos].\n\n(* Shared-key encryption (PRP) *)\n\n(* Probability symbol for encryption, indicating event bound together *)\nproba Penc.\n\n(* Expansion of a Pseudorandom Permutation (PRP) cipher using given parameters *)\nexpand PRP_cipher(keyseed, key, key, kgen, enc, dec, Penc).\n\n(* Message Authentication Code (MAC) operations *)\n\n(* Probability symbol for MAC, indicating event bound together *)\nproba Pmac.\n\n(* Expansion of a SUF-CMA secure MAC using given parameters *)\nexpand SUF_CMA_mac(mkeyseed, mkey, key, macs, mkgen, mac, check, Pmac).\n\n(* Queries to verify the security properties of keys *)\nquery secret1 k2.\nquery secret1 k3.\n\n(* Additional secrecy queries for keys *)\nquery secret k2.\nquery secret k3.\n\n(* Events used for linking process stages in security verification *)\nevent endB(key, macs).\nevent beginA(key, macs).\n\n(* Relational query to ensure beginA event always happens before endB with the same parameters *)\nquery x:key, y:macs, y':macs; event endB(x,y) ==> beginA(x,y).\n\n(* Definition of communication channels for interaction *)\nchannel cA, cB, start, c.\n\n(* Process A simulates the sender, generating key and MAC, and sending them *)\nlet processA = \n\tin(cA, ()); (* Wait for communication on channel cA *)\n\tnew k2 : key; (* Generate a new key k2 *)\n\tlet ea1 = enc(k2, Kab) in (* Encrypt using key k2 and Kab *)\n\tlet t1 = mac(ea1, mKab) in (* MAC the encrypted message *)\n\tevent beginA(ea1, t1); (* Log the beginA event *)\n\tout(cA, (ea1, t1)).

Let's break it down into a descriptive format suitable for generating a similar CV file later.\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nThis protocol demonstrates a simple cryptographic communication scenario involving shared-key encryption and MAC (Message Authentication Code). It primarily consists of two processes, `processA` and `processB`, communicating over defined channels. The emphasis is on testing properties like secrecy and checking event sequences.\n\n### Parameters and Types\n\n- **Parameters**: These determine the multiplicity and complexity of processes.\n  - `N`: Number of repetitions for both processes (corresponds to executions).\n  - `N2`, `N3`: Additional parameters if expansion is required for other applications.\n  \n- **Types**:\n  - `mkey`, `key`: Medium and large keys respectively, for cryptographic operations.\n  - `mkeyseed`, `keyseed`, `seed`: Seed types for key generation.\n  - `macs`: For MAC values.\n  - The types `mkeyseed`, `keyseed`, and `seed` are designated as fixed, indicating they don't change dynamically.\n\n- **Function**:\n  - `keyToBitstring`: A function converting a key to a bitstring with a compositional property.\n\n### Cryptographic Primitives\n\n- **Shared-Key Encryption**: Modeled as a Pseudo-Random Permutation (PRP).\n  - Proba: Failure probability `Penc`.\n  - Expanded using `PRP_cipher`, involving key generation (`kgen`), encryption (`enc`), and decryption (`dec`) operations.\n\n- **MAC**: Safe under Chosen Message Attack (SUF-CMA).\n  - Proba: Failure probability `Pmac`.\n  - Expanded using `SUF_CMA_mac`, involving MAC generation (`mkgen`), MAC application (`mac`), and MAC checking (`check`).\n\n### Security Queries\n\n- **Secrecy**: The protocol includes queries to verify the secrecy of keys `k2` and `k3`.\n  - `secret1`: A strict form that considers adversary capabilities.\n  - `secret`: A general secrecy property indicating no information leakage.\n\n- **Correlation**: A correlation property checks if when `endB` event is logged with specific keys and MACs, it implies a preceding `beginA` event.\n  - `query x:key, y:macs, y':macs; event endB(x,y) ==> beginA(x,y)` ensures that the communication was initiated by `processA`.\n\n### Communication Channels\n\n- **Channels**:\n  - `cA`, `cB`: Channels specific for `processA` and `processB` respectively.\n  - `start`, `c`: Used for initializing and general inter-process communication.\n\n### Processes\n\n- **Process A (`processA`)**:\n  - Receives an empty tuple from channel `cA`.\n  - Generates a new key `k2`.\n  - Encrypts with `enc` and generates a MAC.\n  - Emits `beginA` event with data (`ea1` and `t1`) and sends it through `cA`.\n\n- **Process B (`processB`)**:\n  - Receives an encrypted value and a MAC (`ea`, `ma`) from channel `cB`.\n  - Verifies the MAC with `check`.\n  - Decrypts the encrypted value upon successful verification to derive `k3`.\n  - Emits `endB` event and signals completion through `cB`.\n\n### Process Initialization\n\nThe protocol initiates by:\n- Generating `Kab` and `mKab` for encryption and MAC, respectively, using random seeds (`rKab`, `rmKab`).\n- Launching concurrent instances (`N` repetitions) of `processA` and `processB`.\n\n### Expected Results\n\nThe expectation is that the protocol cannot prove the secrecy of key `k3`, as indicated by the comment at the end of the file. Understanding this outcome can be pivotal for an in-depth analysis of the protocol's robustness.\n\nThis structured understanding can help in creating a new CV file or modifying the existing one with clarity on each aspect of the protocol."]]}, "CV-1/Misha-RPC-enc.cv": {"code": [[true, "set interactiveMode = false.\n\n(* \nremove_assign binder kS_45\ncrypto enc r_46\n*)\n\nparam N.

Below is a description of this protocol based on the cv file you provided. This description can be used to help create a corresponding CV file.\n\n---\n\n### Description of the Protocol: DH Key Exchange with Unknown Key Sharing Attack\n\n#### Protocol Overview\nThe protocol in question is a Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange scheme, which is subjected to variational assumptions and attacks to test its resilience. The model describes the behavior of two parties capable of exchanging keys in an environment where the attacker is present but has limited capabilities. Specifically, the attacker can intercept and replay messages but cannot modify them.\n\n#### Key Components\n\n1. **Types and Parameters:**\n   - The protocol declares several types and parameters including `modp`, `typeg`, `modq`, `R` (all marked as large and fixed), and a `seed`.\n   - `nK`, `na`, `nb`, `n0`, `n1`, `n2`, `n3`, `qS`, `nT` are parameters that appear to control the number of repetitions or instances within the model.\n\n2. **Probabilities and Constants:**\n   - By defining `PCDH1`, `PCDH2`, `PCDH3`, `PCDH4` as probabilities related to Computational Diffie-Hellman (CDH) assumptions for different cases.\n   - A constant `mark` of type bitstring is established which seemingly marks a particular computational scenario.\n\n3. **Functions:**\n   - `pkgen1`, `pkgen2`, and `pkgen3` are functions generating parameters for the DH group, presumably `p`, `g`, and `q` (low modulus, generator, and order of the group, respectively).\n   - Correspondingly, `pkgen'1`, `pkgen'2`, and `pkgen'3` likely do the same but for a hypothetical modified version of the group.\n   - The function `f` simulates the power operation, typically `g^a mod p`, and `f'` represents its alternate in another scenario.\n\n4. **Equivalences and Assumptions:**\n   - Several CDH assumptions (types 1 to 4) are defined, representing different fixed and chosen problem settings. These assumptions are modeled using equivalence relations indicating computations and their translations.\n   - For each scenario, the outcomes are expressed and conditional comparison is done using equivalence expressions which account for potential attacker interactions.\n\n5. **Query and Events:**\n   - Utilizing an event `bad` to mark a potential breach where the protocol might fail, specifically, achieving the query `event bad ==> false` aims to prove that this event never happens.\n   - In this scenario, not being able to prove `event bad ==> false` indicates a potential vulnerability.\n\n6. **Process:**\n   - The `process` block simulates the key exchange mechanism across several communication channels (`c0` to `c7`).\n   - Messages pass between parties involving choices of fresh values `x` and `s`.\n   - The logic ensures a condition where the event `bad` gets triggered if a shared key is either deduced improperly or an attack succeeds, suggesting a desired yield should occur instead of `event bad`.\n\n7. **Attack Model:**\n   - Describes an \"Unknown Key Share\" attack scenario, a weakened form of active attack where intercepted messages can be replayed but not altered.\n\n#### Expected Result\n- The protocol concludes with the expectation that proving `event bad ==> false` might not be achievable, indicating potential for improvement in the critical areas highlighted by the unproven `event bad` scenario.\n\n---\n\nThis description outlines the critical elements and flow of the protocol as specified by the original CV file content.

Here is a descriptive outline of the protocol, allowing you to reconstruct the corresponding Cryptoverif code:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Types and Constants:**\n- `mkey`: Represents a type for keys associated with passwords.\n- `guid`: A fixed type for globally unique identifiers.\n- `Dbdb`: Represents a type for the database.\n- `unit`: A type representing a unit, used as a placeholder.\n- `dummy`: A constant bitstring used as a default or unmatched value.\n\n**Channel:**\n- `c`: A communication channel used for input and output operations.\n\n**Database Related Definitions:**\n- Uses a higher-order definition, `Database`, which models operations in a database setting with:\n  - `option`: Represents optional values, using `Some` and `None` constructors, with distinguishing properties for optional values.\n  - `newdb(guid): db`: A function for creating a new database identified by a `guid`.\n  - `dbinsert(db, key, value): unit`: Inserts a key-value pair into the database.\n  - `select(db, key): option`: Retrieves an optional value associated with a key from the database.\n\n**Equivalence:**\n- Models an equivalence using probabilistic measurement `Pdb`, comparing the insertion and selection operations over a database to highlight potential weaknesses or dependencies.\n\n**Password Operations:**\n- Two primary functions, `PwdPwEntry` and `PwdLeakedPwEntry`, map `mkey` values to corresponding bitstrings. They are designed to ensure that their outputs are distinct from each other and from the `dummy` constant.\n\n**Events and Queries:**\n- Events such as `PwdSend`, `PwdSendLeak`, `PwdAccept`, `PwdPwLeak`, and `PwdSkLeak` track different state changes or actions in the protocol:\n  - `PwdSend` and `PwdSendLeak` mark sending of data based on password entries.\n  - `PwdAccept` denotes a condition where a transmission is accepted post certain controls.\n  - `PwdPwLeak` and `PwdSkLeak` model scenarios of password or key leaks.\n\n- The query defined in the script aims to ensure that whenever `PwdAccept` occurs for a pair of bitstrings `(a, m)`, it implies that `PwdSend(a, m)` must have also occurred. \n\n**Process:**\n- The process models multi-threaded operations in parallel:\n  - In one thread, it listens on channel `c` and initializes a new password database with a generated `guid`. It then outputs a dummy value and repeatedly waits to insert a new password entry into the database upon receiving input.\n  - In another parallel thread, it listens for inputs to mark password leaks, and similarly inserts entries into the database.\n  - A third thread listens for input and checks entries in the database, emitting appropriate events based on whether it finds a normal or leaked password entry.\n\n**Expected Result:**\n- The verification attempts to validate the specified query but is unsuccessful as noted in the expected result indicating the proof could not be established.\n\nThis description encapsulates the logic and setup used within your Cryptoverif script.

Here is an outline of the protocol and its modeling in CryptoVerif, which can help in reconstructing the original code:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\n**Kerberos 5 Protocol using PKINIT:**\n\n1. **Initial Authentication (PKINIT):** \n   - The client authenticates to the Key Distribution Center's Authentication Server (AS) using a public-key method.\n   - The AS provides the client with a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) encrypted with the TGS's secret key.\n   \n2. **Service Request to TGS:**\n   - The client uses the TGT to request service tickets from the Ticket Granting Server (TGS) for accessing resources on various application servers.\n   \n3. **Accessing Services:**\n   - The client presents the service ticket to the application server to access resources.\n\n### Modeling in CryptoVerif\n\n1. **Types and Parameters:**\n   - Various types are defined for nonces, keys, and roles (client, KAS, TGS, server), along with parameters like `N`, `N2`, `qE`, etc., which control nonce counts and oracle execution counts.\n\n2. **Functions for Message Construction:**\n   - Functions such as `concat1` to `concat8`, `padno`, and `padts` are defined to model the concatenation of protocol elements.\n   - `forall` constraints establish non-equality conditions between these constructed messages to simulate unique identification properties of the messages.\n\n3. **Cryptographic Assumptions:**\n   - **Public-Key Encryption:** Uses IND-CCA2 security model.\n   - **Signatures:** Modeled with UF-CMA security.\n   - **Symmetric Encryption:** IND-CPA and INT-CTXT secure symmetric encryption.\n\n4. **Simplification and Game Transformations:**\n   - The script simplifies the protocol's operational representations and explores transformations to assist in proving properties like secrecy and IND-CCA2 security.\n\n5. **Oracles for Encryption and Decryption:**\n   - Two oracles (`processOE`, `processOD`) simulate encryption and decryption queries to an oracle, which are used for analyzing the security by checking if the queries reveal any secret information (`b1`).\n\n6. **Main Process:**\n   - Begins by generating keys and running the encryption and decryption oracle processes multiple times (`qE`, `qD` are the repetition bounds).\n   - The main process also outputs the result of these executions to specified channels, completing the protocol simulation.\n\n7. **Security Queries:**\n   - Queries like `query secret1 b1` are used to verify if certain protocol data, specifically `b1`, remains secret under the protocol execution.\n\n### Expected Result\n\nThe expected output indicates an inability to prove one-session secrecy of `b1`, revealing potential weaknesses in the encryption implementations when coupled with this specific protocol configuration.\n\nWith this structured description, you should be able to reverse-engineer the protocol model in CryptoVerif, piece by piece, conforming to this high-level overview."]]}, "CV-1/otestINDCPA.ocv": {"code": [[true, "(* Trivial running example for conference paper. *)\n\nparam N.

The file remains ready to be processed by CryptoVerif."]], "logic": [[true, "The given CryptoVerif code describes a protocol involving two main processes, `processA` and `processB`, and is designed to test the security properties of shared-key encryption (CPA secure) and a message authentication code (MAC, SUF-CMA secure). The protocol aims to analyze whether certain keys (`k2` and `k3`) can be kept secret while ensuring integrity and authenticity properties via events marked within the protocol execution.\n\nHere is a detailed description of the protocol:\n\n1. **Parameters and Types**:\n   - The protocol uses three parameters `N`, `N2`, and `N3` which likely denote repetitions or counts but are not further utilized beyond the top-level introduction.\n   - Four cryptographic types are declared as either `bounded` (presumably having a maximum length) or `fixed` (of fixed size): `mkey`, `mkeyseed`, `key`, and `keyseed`.\n   - `seed` and `macs` are used presumably for secure randomness and message authenticity codes, respectively.\n   - The `keyToBitstring` function converts a `key` to its `bitstring` representation, marked with `compos`, which may denote composability.\n\n2. **Shared-Key Encryption (CPA Secure)**:\n   - The protocol employs a stream cipher for encryption verified against Ciphertext-Policy Attribute-Based Encryption (CPA) security model.\n   - The `expand IND_CPA_sym_enc` statement specifies key generation, encryption, and decryption functions (`kgen`, `enc`, `dec`), alongside a probability `Penc` which might denote the error or success rate of the cryptographic assumption.\n\n3. **Zero Function**:\n   - The constant `Zkey` is defined as a bitstring of zeroes.\n   - A forall statement links any bitstring derived from a key conversion to `Zkey`, implying that only zeroed bitstrings can be retrieved via this pathway\u2014an encryption property constraint.\n\n4. **MAC (SUF-CMA Secure)**:\n   - The MAC is checked for security against existential forgery (SUF-CMA).\n   - Functions for key generation (`mkgen`), MAC creation (`mac`), and validity checking (`check`) are given via the `expand SUF_CMA_mac` statement along with an associated probability `Pmac`.\n\n5. **Queries**:\n   - Queries are introduced to challenge the secrecy of keys `k2` and `k3`.\n   - An event-dependent query ensures that if `endB` (an endpoint event) is triggered for bitstrings `x` and `y`, it must be preceded by `beginA`.\n\n6. **Processes**:\n    - `processA` and `processB` handle the encryption and MAC generation between two communication channels `cA` and `cB`.\n    - In `processA`, a new key `k2` and seed `s1` are generated. An encrypted commitment is made using these, creating `ea1`, and a MAC is generated as `t1`. An event `beginA` records these values before outputting them onto channel `cA`.\n    - `processB` receives encrypted data and MAC, verifies the MAC, decrypts to potentially recover a key `k3`, and triggers the `endB` event if successful.\n\n7. **Main Process**:\n   - Initialization processes generate key seeds/hashes for `Kab` and `mKab`, with a public broadcast of readiness.\n   - The main process concurrently spawns `N` instances each of `processA` and `processB`, simulating multiple protocol runs.\n\n8. **Expected Result**:\n   - There's an explicit expectation/outcome that the secrecy of `k3` cannot be proved, suggesting a possible vulnerability or intended behavior of this protocol test.\n\nThis protocol description encompasses the cryptographic primitives, processes, queries, and expected outcomes essential for reconstructing and executing the protocol using CryptoVerif."]]}, "CV-1/bug-otheruses-hash.cv": {"code": [[true, "(* \nBug related to simplify/otheruses: the event termS is finally\nremoved\n*)\n\nproof {\n  crypto hash; (* Use cryptographic properties of the hash function. *)\n  simplify;    (* Apply simplification rules. *)\n  simplify;    (* Further simplification to streamline the proof. *)\n  auto         (* Automatically handle trivial goals. *)\n}\n\n(* Set to interactive mode for manual proof steps if needed. *)\n(* set interactiveMode = true. *)\n\nparam NU, NS, NP.

Below is the description content of this protocol, which provides a comprehensive understanding that would allow for the reconstruction of a cv file suitable for analysis with cryptoverif.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Overview\n\nThis protocol sets up an interaction between two entities, a client (`U`) and a server (`S`). The interaction is based on a challenge-response mechanism involving hash computations. Random oracle assumptions are used for the hash function to capture its behavior as an ideal cryptographic hash.\n\n#### Parameters and Types\n\n- **NU, NS, NP**: Parameters defining the maximum number of concurrent instances and protocol-specific values.\n- **N, qH**: Parameters related to the hash oracle; `qH` specifies the number of queries allowed, and `N` establishes a limit on find queries.\n- **G, nonce, thash**: Types for group elements and nonces, both large and fixed to represent elements typically used in cryptographic operations. `thash` represents the type for hashed values.\n- **host**: A bounded type representing entities like client and server.\n\n#### Hash Function\n\n- `hash(G, nonce):thash`: A hash function defined in the random oracle model, mapping elements from `G` and `nonce` to `thash`.\n\n#### Equivalence\n\nAn equivalence is specified to model the behavior of the hash function within the random oracle model:\n\n- The protocol checks if a given hash has been previously computed in a unique manner, allowing reuse of results where appropriate.\n\n#### Channels\n\n- Multiple channels (`c1` to `c9`, `cp`, `start`, `finish`) facilitate communication between entities.\n- Channels `c10` and `c20` are used for interfacing with the hash oracle.\n\n#### Processes\n\n1. **Hash Oracle Process**:\n   - Listens on channel `c10` for inputs `(x1, x2)` and outputs the result of the hash computation on channel `c20`.\n\n2. **Client Process (`processU`)**:\n   - Begins by receiving a trigger on channel `c1`.\n   - Generates a new group element `X` and sends it over channel `c2`.\n   - Waits for input `(=S, Ystar_u)` on channel `c5` (ensures the sender is the server).\n   - Computes a hash using the received `Ystar_u` and a secret nonce `pw`.\n   - Sends an acknowledgment on channel `c6`.\n\n3. **Server Process (`processS`)**:\n   - Awaits input `(=U, X_s)` on channel `c3` (ensures the sender is the client).\n   - Produces a new group element `Ystar` and computes a hash with the secret `pw`.\n   - Sends `(S, Ystar)` through channel `c4`.\n   - After receiving a signal on channel `c7`, performs a find operation to match the hash with stored values.\n   - If a match is found, triggers an event `termS`.\n\n#### Queries\n\n- The protocol aims to prove that the event `termS` cannot happen: `query event termS ==> false`.\n- This query evaluates the security goal by asserting that no matching session between the client and server based on this protocol should trigger `termS`, which may denote a breach of some expectations or agreement in a real protocol.\n\n#### Execution and Expected Result\n\n- The process execution begins with receiving on channel `start` and establishes new passwords by selecting nonces.\n- Processes for multiple client and server instances run concurrently with a hash oracle.\n- The expected outcome of the cryptoverif analysis is a failure to prove the query, indicating potential protocol vulnerabilities or an incomplete specification regarding preventing the `termS` event from occurring.\n\nThis description consolidates the protocol's structure and goals, providing a foundation for replicating the cv file content necessary for analysis with the cryptoverif tool."]]}, "CV-1/Avik-hash-elgamal-CDH.cv": {"code": [[true, "(** Hashed ElGamal encryption scheme, in the random oracle model **)\n\n(** An encryption scheme is shown to be SS\n    under the CDH assumption, in the random oracle model.\n    See Section 8, \"Sequences of Games\", Victor Shoup. **)\n\nparam n, q, nH, nCDH, nCDH'.\n\n(** Parameters:\n    n    - number of encryptions\n    q    - number of queries\n    nH   - number of hash queries\n    nCDH - number of queries to the CDH assumption.\n    nCDH'- number of queries without collision for ElGamal encryption. **)\n\ntype Z [fixed].\ntype G.\ntype K [large,fixed].\ntype D [fixed].\n\n(** Types:\n    Z - integers, used for exponents\n    G - group elements, for the group in which the CDH assumption holds\n    K - keys, with a fixed large size\n    D - data, for the plaintext/ciphertext and results of the hash function **)\n\nproba pCDH.\n\n(** Probability of breaking the CDH assumption. **)\n\nfun exp(G,Z): G.\nconst gamma:G.\n\n(** Function and constant:\n    exp(G,Z) - exponentiation in the group\n    gamma    - a group element (generator) **)\n\nfun mult(Z,Z): Z.\nequation commut(mult).\n\n(* exponents multiply *)\n\nforall a:G, x:Z, y:Z;\n  exp(exp(a,x), y) = exp(a, mult(x,y)).\n\n(** Multiplier and exponentiation properties:\n    mult(Z,Z) - multiplication of integers\n    commut(mult) - commutative property of multiplication\n    Property: exponentiation respects multiplication of exponents **)\n\nfun xor(D,D): D.\n\n(* xor self-cancels *)\n\nforall x:D, y:D;\n  xor(x, xor(x,y)) = y.\n\n(** XOR function:\n    xor(D,D) - bitwise XOR operation\n    Property: XOR is self-canceling (x XOR x = 0) **)\n\n(* xor(.,y) is a one-time pad *)\n\nequiv \n    (y:D) n -> new x:D;

Below is the description content for this protocol, which can serve as a guideline for generating the corresponding Cryptoverif file:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nThe script describes a Hashed ElGamal encryption protocol, which is a variation of the standard ElGamal encryption. It is studied under the random oracle model, which is an abstract model used to analyze cryptographic protocols where hash functions are considered as random oracles. The security of this scheme relies on the CDH assumption, a well-known computational hardness assumption in cryptography.\n\n### Key Elements\n\n1. **Types and Parameters:**\n   - `n, q, nH, nCDH, nCDH'`: Parameters representing counts for operations.\n   - Types `Z`, `G`, `K`, `D`: Definitions for integers, group elements, key elements, and data types. `Z` and `D` are fixed types, while `K` is a large and fixed type.\n\n2. **Group Operations:**\n   - `exp(G,Z): G`: Exponentiation operation in the group \\(G\\).\n   - `mult(Z,Z): Z`: Multiplication operation on exponent integers, which is commutative.\n\n3. **Functions and Properties:**\n   - `xor(D,D): D`: A function representing the XOR operation, which has self-canceling properties. XOR mimics a one-time pad in this context.\n   - `h(K,G): D`: A hash function modeled as a random oracle.\n   - `choose(bool,D,D): D`: A conditional function for choosing data based on a boolean value.\n\n4. **Cryptographic Assumptions:**\n   - **CDH Assumption**: Modeled through an equivalence that describes the difficulty of computing the shared secret \\(exp(\\gamma, mult(x,y))\\) from \\(exp(\\gamma, x)\\) and \\(exp(\\gamma, y)\\).\n\n5. **Processes:**\n   - **`processE`**: Implements the encryption operation, where:\n     - It receives two messages \\(m_0\\) and \\(m_1\\).\n     - Randomly selects a boolean \\(b\\) and encrypts the message \\(m_b\\) using the public key derived from the group generator \\(gamma\\).\n     - Produces ciphertext consisting of a pair `(beta, v)`, where `beta` is a masked group element, and `v` is the message ciphertext XOR'ed with a hash.\n   - **`processH`**: Handles hash evaluations under the random oracle model.\n   - **Main Process**: Manages key generation, the initiation of encryption, and public key dissemination.\n\n6. **Queries:**\n   - The security goal revolves around maintaining the secrecy of the boolean `b` used in the `choose` function, representing the challenger bit in a security game.\n\n### Execution\n\nThe protocol includes a replication factor `!q` representing independent games or sessions. This differs from the original reference in Shoup's work, where such replication isn't explicitly listed. However, in cryptographic proof systems, such replication can be used to model repeated independent executions for strengthening security assessments.\n\n### Expected Outcome\n\nThe protocol anticipates proving all required queries related to message secrecy. The computational logs indicate the efficiency and resource usage of the verification process (`0.030s`), which reflects the script's practical performance execution when run through the Cryptoverif tool.\n\n---\n\nWith this description, one can generate a corresponding CV file accurately matching the provided protocol's specifications.

The goal is to prove the indistinguishability property of encryption under CCA2 attacks.\n\n### Types and Constants\n- **Types:**\n  - `pkey`: Public key type, bounded.\n  - `skey`: Secret key type, bounded.\n  - `keyseed`: A seed for key generation, fixed size.\n  - `cleartext`: The type for plaintext messages.\n  - `ciphertext`: The type for ciphertexts.\n  - `enc_seed`: Seed used for encryption, bounded.\n\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `N, N2`: Security parameters that limit the number of operations for encryption and decryption requests, respectively.\n\n- **Probability:**\n  - `Penc`: Probability related to the encryption process.\n\n### Functions\n- `Z(cleartext): cleartext` - Some transformation or identity function operating on plaintexts.\n- `enc(cleartext, pkey, enc_seed): ciphertext` - Encrypts a `cleartext` using a `pkey` and an `enc_seed`.\n- `skgen(keyseed): skey` - Generates a secret key from a key seed.\n- `pkgen(keyseed): pkey` - Generates a public key from a key seed.\n- `dec(ciphertext, skey): bitstringbot` - Attempts to decrypt a ciphertext back to a cleartext or indicates failure.\n- `injbot(cleartext): bitstringbot` - A function that injects cleartext into the `bitstringbot` type, suggests conversion with possible failure handling.\n\n### Equation\n- Decryption and encryption correctness: \n  - `forall m: cleartext, k: keyseed, r: enc_seed; dec(enc(m, pkgen(k), r), skgen(k)) = injbot(m)`. \n  - This implies that decrypting an encrypted message should yield the original message.\n\n### Tables\n- **cipher(cleartext, ciphertext)**: This table records pairs of plaintext and corresponding ciphertext that are produced during the execution of the protocol.\n\n### Security Goals\n- The equivalence `equiv(ind_cca2(enc))` represents the CCA2 security notion.\n- This notion is demonstrated by comparing two processes where:\n  - In the left process, decryption of `enc(m, pk, r)` with `sk` results directly in `injbot(m)`.\n  - In the right process, this is emulated by storing results in the `cipher` table and retrieving them if available, otherwise using actual decryption.\n\n### Processes\n- **Opk**: Returns the public key generated from the key seed.\n- **Odec**: Attempts to decrypt given ciphertext and outputs the result of `injbot` if found in `cipher`, else runs decryption.\n- **Oenc**: Encrypts a cleartext using the public key and randomness.\n\n### Execution\n- The process will execute under `N` encryption oracle calls (`Oenc`) and `N2` decryption oracle calls (`Odec`).\n- The target is proving that the probability of distinguishing between two scenarios (concerning the encryption) is bounded by `N * Penc(...)`.\n\nThis describes a classical IND-CCA2 secure encryption scheme within the CryptoVerif framework using bounded keys, making use of an oracle-based paradigm to demonstrate security properties and records these operations to ensure consistent security analysis."]]}, "CV-1/ind_cpa.cv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *       Translation from CryptoVerif to EasyCrypt           *\n *                                                           *\n *       Bruno Blanchet, Pierre Boutry, Christian Doczkal,   *\n *       and Pierre-Yves Strub                               *\n *                                                           *\n *       Copyright INRIA, MPI-SP, Ecole Polytechnique,       *\n *\t 2019-2024                                           *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    Copyright INRIA, MPI-SP, Ecole Polytechnique\n    contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\n                  Pierre Boutry, Pierre.Boutry@inria.fr\n                  Christian Doczkal, Christian.Doczkal@mpi-sp.org\n                  Pierre-Yves Strub, pierre-yves@strub.nu\n\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to translate\nCryptoVerif security assumptions into EasyCrypt.\n\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

Here's a description of the protocol that's intended to be described by this cv file:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Purpose:**\n\nThe protocol evaluates the security of an encryption scheme by testing the indistinguishability of ciphertexts generated from either a plaintext or a zeroed plaintext under a chosen key. The protocol essentially models an IND-CPA challenge, where an adversary attempts to distinguish between encryptions of specific plaintexts and a trivial transformation of those plaintexts.\n\n**Types:**\n\n1. **cleartext**: Represents the type for plaintext messages.\n2. **ciphertext**: Represents the type for ciphertext messages.\n3. **key [bounded]**: Represents encryption keys. The `[bounded]` attribute suggests that there is a finite set of possible values for this type.\n4. **enc_seed [bounded]**: Represents the random seed used in the encryption process, also indicating a finite set of possible seeds.\n\n**Functions:**\n\n1. **enc(cleartext, key, enc_seed): ciphertext**: A function that takes a plaintext message, a key, and a random seed, and outputs a ciphertext. This represents the encryption function.\n2. **Z(cleartext): cleartext**: This function transforms a plaintext into another defined form. In an IND-CPA context, it often returns a constant or zero value to test the adversary's ability to distinguish encryptions.\n\n**Parameters:**\n\n- **N**: The maximum number of encryption queries allowed.\n- **Penc**: The probability bound provided for distinguishing between the two distributions.\n\n**Equivalence: `ind_cpa(enc)`**\n\nThe equivalence tests whether, given access to an encryption oracle, an adversary can distinguish between:\n\n- An oracle `Oenc` that encrypts the original plaintext `x` using a randomly chosen key `k` and seed `r`.\n- An oracle `Oenc` that encrypts a transformed plaintext `Z(x)` (usually a zero transformation) with the same randomly chosen key `k` and seed `r`.\n\nEach oracle is defined in a loop `foreach i <= N`, where for up to `N` times, a random seed `r` is selected, and either the plaintext `x` or its zeroed form `Z(x)` is encrypted.\n\nThe equivalence is defined with a negligible difference `Penc(time, N, maxlength(x))`, suggesting that the adversary's probability of distinguishing between these two scenarios should not significantly exceed `Penc`.\n\n**Process:**\n\nA process with an identifier `0` is declared but not further defined in this excerpt, suggesting a placeholder for processes using or extending this equivalence setup.\n\n### Generating the Corresponding CryptoVerif File\n\nBased on the description, one can generate the equivalent Cryptoverif file by leveraging the structure, types, functions, and logical constructs mentioned, ensuring that the indentation, language syntax, and typing align with Cryptoverif's requirements for defining cryptographic game-based proofs."]]}, "CV-1/pfdh.cv": {"code": [[true, "(******************************************************************\n *                                                                *\n * Cryptographic Protocol Verifier                                *\n *                                                                *\n * Bruno Blanchet, David Cad\u00e9, Aymeric Fromherz, Charlie Jacomme, *\n * and Benjamin Lipp                                              *\n *                                                                *\n * Copyright (C) ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP, 2005-2024              *\n *                                                                *\n ******************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    Copyright ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP\n    Contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\n                  David Cad\u00e9\n                  Aymeric Fromherz, Aymeric.Fromherz@inria.fr\n                  Charlie Jacomme, Charlie.Jacomme@inria.fr\n                  Benjamin Lipp, benjamin.lipp@mpi-sp.org\n\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to verify \ncryptographic protocols in the computational model.\n\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

Let me give you a textual description of this protocol in detail:\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\nThis protocol models a digital signature scheme that uses a hash function and a trapdoor permutation. It is designed to mimic standard assumptions used with hash functions such as the Random Oracle Model (ROM). The model undertakes a process with two primary roles: a signer and a verifier.\n\n### Parameters\n\n- `qS`: A parameter representing the maximum number of signature queries that the adversary can make.\n\n### Types\n\n- **Keys**:\n  - `pkey`: Public keys are assumed to be bounded.\n  - `skey`: Secret keys are also bounded.\n  - `keyseed`: Used for generating keys, assumed to be large and fixed.\n  - `seed`: Seed values, fixed.\n\n- **Data Types**:\n  - `D`: Large and fixed, used within the cryptographic operations.\n\n### Cryptographic Operations\n\n- **Trapdoor Permutation**:\n  - Described by the command `expand OW_trapdoor_perm(...)`, where `f` represents the trapdoor permutation, and `mf` is its inverse. The security property captured by probability `pOW` refers to the one-way nature.\n\n- **Hash Function**:\n  - Implemented as a random oracle, specified by `expand ROM_hash_large(...)`, utilizing a `hashkey` and working on bitstring inputs. The corresponding hash oracle and its query capacity `qH` are defined as part of the model.\n\n### Process Descriptions\n\n#### Signer Process (`processS`)\n\n- **Hear Channel `c1`**:\n  - Listens for a message `m` (of type `bitstring`).\n- **Generate Signature**:\n  - Generates a new seed `sr`.\n  - Computes a signature using the trapdoor permutation's inverse `mf` combined with the hash of `(m, sr)`, then outputs through the channel `c2`.\n\n#### Verifier Process (`processT`)\n\n- **Hear Channel `c3`**:\n  - Expects a triplet `(m2:bitstring, sr:seed, s:D)`.\n- **Verification**:\n  - The message is authenticated if applying `f` on the signature `s` results in the hashed value of `(m2, sr)` according to public key `pk`.\n  - If a match is found, it checks through past signature queries to detect possible breaks, invoking an event `bad` if a signature forgery occurs.\n\n### Main Process\n\n- Initiated upon receiving an unspecified message from `start`.\n- Generates new cryptographic primitives (`hashkey`, `keyseed`).\n- Produces and publishes a key pair via `pkgen` and `skgen` onto channel `c0`.\n- Operates concurrently with an instance of the hash oracle, signer, and verifier processes.\n\n### Properties and Goals\n\n- **Security** is measured by detecting if the `bad` event can be triggered, which would indicate a breach of security, notably in signature forgery.\n- The queries section includes `query event(bad) ==> false`, ensuring that the `bad` event should never hold in a secure protocol.\n\n### Result\n\nThe protocol has been checked, proving all queries successfully with computational resources highlighted in the \"EXPECTED\" section of the file.\n\n--- \n\nThis description captures the core ideas and methodological setting of the Cryptoverif model relating to the given protocol.

Based on your OCV file, here's a description of the protocol which you can use to regenerate the file with the provided content:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description\n\nThis protocol implements a cryptographic Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) that aims to achieve security against selected ciphertext attacks (CCA). It defines several custom types and functions to achieve this, along with hash functions assumed to be collision-resistant.\n\n**Types:**\n- `cpa_pk`, `cpa_sk`: Represent public and private keys for a CPA-secure scheme.\n- `cpa_ciphertext`: Represents a ciphertext in the CPA-secure scheme.\n- `cpa_key_seed`, `cpa_enc_seed`: Seeds for key generation and encryption, respectively.\n- `kemskey`: Secret key in the CCA-secure KEM.\n- `kem_seed`, `kem_enc_seed`: Seeds used in the key generation and encapsulation processes of the KEM.\n- `kemsec`: Security parameter type in the KEM.\n- `kem_keypair`: Composed of a KEM public key and its associated secret key.\n- `hashes, hashkey, hashkey2, hashkey3`: Types associated with hash functions used in the protocol.\n- `encapspair`: Represents a pair comprising a ciphertext and encapsulated key in the KEM.\n\n**Functions:**\n- `KEM_KeyPair(cpa_pk, kemskey)`: Produces a KEM keypair.\n- Cryptographic hash functions (`H1`, `H2`, `H3`) and a derived function for key derivation function (`KDF`) along with relevant probabilities (`qH2`, `qH3`, `qH4`).\n- `cpa_pkgen` and `cpa_skgen`: Generate CPA public and secret keys.\n- `cpa_enc` and `cpa_dec`: Standard CPA encryption and decryption functions, fulfilling the equation `cpa_dec( cpa_skgen(s), cpa_enc( cpa_pkgen(s), m, r)) =m`.\n- `concat4`: Concatenates four types (`cpa_sk`, `cpa_pk`, `hashes`, `B`) into `kemskey`.\n- `cca_gen`: Generates a CCA KEM keypair using a seed and a hash key.\n- `KEMEncaps`: Constructs encapsulation pairs.\n- `cca_encaps`: Encapsulation function for the KEM, leveraging hashes and derived operations as pseudo-random functions.\n- `cca_decap`: Decapsulation function, ensuring ciphertext validity and returning either derived or null security.\n\n**Protocol Flow (within Cryptoverif Process):**\n1. Start by initializing hash keys and the security bit (`secb`).\n2. Randomly generate seeds for the KEM process (`kem_seed`, `kem_enc_seed`).\n3. Generate a KEM keypair using `cca_gen`.\n4. Interact with hash oracles for `KDF`, `H`, and `G1`.\n5. When challenged (`OChall`), the protocol computes encapsulations and decapsulations, ensuring that valid decryptions are measured against expectation, and reconciling with `secb` to confirm security metrics.\n\nThe `query secret secb [cv_bit]` statement checks how well `secb` remains indistinguishable in different scenarios, indicating the overall security of the protocol's confidentiality.\n\n**Settings and Process:**\n- The protocol uses the settings `autoMergeBranches` and `autoSARename` to simplify verification.\n- The `proof` block uses transformation tactics to guide Cryptoverif in applying its transformation rules to prove the intended security properties.\n\nThis description is detailed enough to recreate the OCV file with understanding of each component, its role, and how the protocol achieves CCA security within the KEM scheme context."]]}, "CV-1/OAEP-CPA.cv": {"code": [[true, "(* OAEP scheme, proof of CPA security *)\n\nproof {\n      crypto rom(H);  (* Treat H as a random oracle *)\n      crypto rom(G);  (* Treat G as a random oracle *)\n      show_game occ;  (* Display the current game state with occurrence counting *)\n      insert_event bad1 31;  (* Insert an event 'bad1' with a priority of 31 *)\n      show_game occ;  (* Display the current game state again *)\n      insert_event bad2 59;  (* Insert an event 'bad2' with a priority of 59 *)\n      crypto remove_xor(xorDr) \"@10_r_129\";  (* Optimizations for specific xor operations *)\n      crypto remove_xor(xorDow) \"@9_r_137\";      \n      remove_assign binder pk;  (* Remove assignments to the 'pk' variable to prevent leakage *)\n      crypto pd_ow(f) \"r_107\" \"@9_r_146\" \"@10_r_144\";  (* Optimize game transformation using pd_ow property *)\n      success  (* conclude proof successfully *)\n}\n\nparam qS.

Below is a detailed description of the protocol, capturing the essential constructs and flow that you can use to recreate the cv file.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n1. **Cryptographic Assumptions and Setup**:\n    - The protocol leverages hash functions modeled as Random Oracles (`ROM_hash`). Two hash functions are defined: `H` and `G`, which operate on different types and are associated with random oracle instances.\n    - Types for keys (`pkey`, `skey`) and other elements (`seed`, `D`, `Dow`, `Dr`) are declared, with various attributes (e.g., `bounded`, `fixed`, `large`) describing their nature.\n    - A partial-domain one-way trapdoor permutation is considered, which is cryptographically assumed by an event named `P_PD_OW`.\n\n2. **Hash Function and Random Oracle Model**:\n    - The protocol uses a random oracle model for hash functions, defining two separate oracles:\n        - `hashoracleG`: Hashes values of type `Dr` using hash function `G`.\n        - `hashoracleH`: Hashes values of type `Dow` using hash function `H`.\n    - These oracles are set up using designated channels for inputs and outputs (`ch1`, `ch2` for `G`; `ch3`, `ch4` for `H`).\n\n3. **Operations**:\n    - A generic `xor` operation is defined over types `Dow` and `Dr` to combine values, along with a zero element for each type.\n    - A `concatm` function is defined to concatenate a message `Dm` and a fixed-size component `Dz`. This forms the message part `Dow` used for encryption.\n\n4. **Test Functionality**:\n    - A `test` function is introduced for selecting messages based on a boolean without expanding into an explicit `if` statement within the Cryptoverif environment, which aids in the foundational proof.\n\n5. **Process Script**:\n    - **Initialization**:\n        - The protocol initiates a process whereby a public key (`pk`) and secret key (`sk`) are derived from a randomly generated seed using functions `pkgen` and `skgen`.\n        - Public key `pk` is communicated over channel `c0`.\n    - **Encryption Process**:\n        - A pair of messages `(m1, m2)` is received, and a random bit `b1` is generated to determine which message to encrypt.\n        - Message `menc` is selected based on `b1` using the `test` function, rather than an explicit `if` statement.\n        - A random value `r` of type `Dr` is generated, which combines with the output of `G` hashed with `r` to form `s`.\n        - The value `s` is then hashed using `H`, combined with `r` through `xor`, and forms the tuple `(s, t)` that is encrypted using the trapdoor function `f` with the public key.\n        - The encryption result is sent over channel `c2`.\n\n6. **Proof**:\n    - The proof defines a sequence of transformations and event insertions to demonstrate the security properties, such as non-detectable events (`bad1`, `bad2`) and modifying the process to handle these securely.\n    - Certain assignments and cryptographic operations (`remove_xor`, `remove_assign`) are modified or removed as part of cryptographic arguments to reinforce security.\n    - The proof ends successfully with expected assertions met.\n\nThe protocol utilizes the OAEP scheme within the framework of a chosen plaintext attack model, applying careful transformations and assumptions to establish security properties using the Cryptoverif tool.

Below is an explanation and description of the protocol, which can be used to generate a similar OCV file:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description\n\nThis protocol involves two kinds of agents, `A` and `B`, which interact using public key cryptography and Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish a secure communication channel. Additionally, it involves the use of signature schemes and a hash function modeled as a random oracle.\n\n#### Components\n\n1. **Parameters and Types:**\n   - `NA`, `NB`, `NK`: These parameters define the number of agents of type `A`, type `B`, and the number of public keys.\n   - `host`, `keyseed`, `pkey`, `skey`, `message`, `signature`: These are various types used in the protocol for host identification, key generation, message, and signature handling.\n   - `G`, `Z`, `key`: Types used in the Diffie-Hellman key exchange for the group, field, and derived keys.\n   - `hashfunction`: Type for defining the hash function used in the protocol.\n\n2. **Diffie-Hellman Setup:**\n   - `DH_basic`: Macro used to define basic operations for the Diffie-Hellman key exchange including exponentiation and group operations.\n   - `DH_proba_collision`: Declares probabilities to handle collision events in the Diffie-Hellman setup to ensure session uniqueness.\n\n3. **Cryptographic Assumptions:**\n   - `CDH`: Computational Diffie-Hellman assumption, with probability `pCDH`.\n   - `UF_CMA_proba_signature`: Assumption for the signature scheme, with probabilities `Psign` and `Psigncoll` indicating signature forgery and key collision probabilities, respectively.\n\n4. **Hash Function:**\n   - Modeled using the `ROM_hash` macro which defines the random oracle behavior for hashing operations.\n\n5. **Agents and Processes:**\n   - `A` and `B`: Constants representing two honest peers engaging in the protocol.\n   - `processA` and `processB`: Define operations for agents `A` and `B` respectively. The actual protocol logic (`SomeOracleTODO`) would replace these placeholders to specify how these agents interact.\n   - `pki`: A process handling the public key infrastructure, presumably for the distribution and verification of public keys.\n   - `keygen`: Defines symmetric key generation and the corresponding public key derivation.\n\n6. **Main Protocol Process:**\n   - `Ostart`: Initializes the protocol by generating the signing keys and public keys for both agents `A` and `B`. Then, it concurrently runs the agent processes `processA`, `processB`, the public key infrastructure process `pki`, and the hash oracle.\n\n#### Queries and Events\n\n- The file placeholders, indicating where to define secrecy queries, authentication event queries, and the public key infrastructure details, suggest this setup could be extended for specific security properties.\n\n### Reconstructions\n\nTo reconstruct a working OCV file:\n\n- Replace placeholder logic (`SomeOracleTODO`, `OtherOracleTODO`) with the actual cryptographic operations or logic unique to the intended protocol.\n- Define specific secrecy and authentication queries to capture and verify security properties using the **cryptoverif** tool.\n- Provide details on the public key infrastructure if necessary for validation and distribution of public keys.\n\nThis description forms the basis for recreating the conceptual setup and approach used in defining a cryptoverif protocol from the original OCV file setup provided."]]}, "CV-1/tls13-core-RecordProtocol-0RTT.cv": {"code": [[true, "(******************************************************************\n *                                                                *\n * Cryptographic protocol verifier                                *\n *                                                                *\n * Bruno Blanchet, David Cad\u00e9, Aymeric Fromherz, Charlie Jacomme, *\n * and Benjamin Lipp                                              *\n *                                                                *\n * Copyright (C) ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP, 2005-2024              *\n *                                                                *\n ******************************************************************)\n\n(*\n    Copyright ENS, CNRS, INRIA, MPI-SP\n    contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\n                  David Cad\u00e9\n                  Aymeric Fromherz, Aymeric.Fromherz@inria.fr\n                  Charlie Jacomme, Charlie.Jacomme@inria.fr\n                  Benjamin Lipp, benjamin.lipp@mpi-sp.org\n\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to verify \ncryptographic protocols in the computational model.\n\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

This can facilitate understanding for users who are familiar with the semantics of the Cryptoverif language."]], "logic": [[true, "The given code snippet is a Cryptoverif code file for analyzing the security properties of a cryptographic protocol. Here's a structured description of the protocol, based on the provided code:\n\n### Description of the Protocol\n\n#### Overview\nThis protocol assumes a client and a server initially share a random traffic secret, which is updated as the protocol progresses. The protocol involves encrypting and sending messages between these parties using a key derived from this shared secret, using the AEAD encryption scheme.\n\n#### Types and Parameters\n- **key, seqn, nonce_t, nocolltype**: These are declared as fixed types used within the protocol. `key` and `nonce_t` are considered large.\n- **N, Nk, Ne, Nd, Ns, NSr, Nr**: These are parameters used in the protocol, typically representing bounds on numbers or sizes related to protocol interactions.\n\n#### Functions and Probabilities\n- **HKDF_expand_upd_label, HKDF_expand_key_label, HKDF_expand_iv_label**: Functions used as part of the derivation of new keys and ivs based on the shared secret.\n- **proba Pprf_upd_key_iv**: This probability is used in the equivalence to model the security of the key derivation.\n\n#### Key Derivation\nA lemma from an unspecified `HKDFexpand.cv` file is referenced, which likely pertains to properties of the HKDF key derivation function. The derivation is modeled with an equivalence (`equiv(prf_upd_key_iv)`) between using these derivations and using fresh keys/ivs, indicating a proof of pseudorandomness.\n\n#### Equations and Definitions\n- **xor(key, seqn): nonce_t**: A function to xor a key with a sequence number to derive a nonce. Injective property enforced by an equation.\n- **AEAD_nonce(...)**: Defines the use of an AEAD scheme for encryption and decryption, ensuring IND-CPA and INT-CTXT security under the assumption of unique nonces for each encryption.\n\n#### Message Handling\n- **Tables**: \n  - `table_count_send(seqn)` and `table_count_recv(nocolltype, seqn)` are used to ensure sequence numbers are not reused, preventing replay attacks.\n\n- **Events**:\n  - `sent(seqn, bitstring)` and `received(seqn, bitstring)` record the sending and receiving of messages associated with specific sequence numbers.\n\n#### Queries\n- **Secrecy**: The protocol queries the secrecy of plaintexts (`secret b0 public_vars traffic_secret_Nplus1`) and updated traffic secrets (`secret traffic_secret_Nplus1 public_vars b0`).\n- **Authenticity**: It verifies that if a message is received (`received(count, msg)`), it must have been sent first (`sent(count, msg)`).\n\n#### Processes\n- **send**: Simulates sending a message securely. Ensures sequence numbers haven't been reused, encrypts the message, and emits a `sent` event.\n  \n- **receive**: Simulates the reception of a message. Verifies the sequence number hasn't been reused for a given session, decrypts the message, and emits a `received` event.\n\n- **Main Process**: Starts by receiving on channel `io1`, establishing a secret and keys for the session, and outputting on channel `io2`. It then concurrently executes the `send` and `receive` processes.\n\n#### Expected Results\nThe expected result is that all queries are proved, indicating the protocol maintains both the secrecy and authenticity properties under the assumptions given. The expected computation time is provided.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis protocol file sets up a cryptographic verification of a communications protocol involving secure key updates, using HKDF for key derivation and AEAD for message encryption. The analysis focuses on ensuring message integrity, confidentiality, and non-replay properties within a bounded session context."]]}, "CV-1/woolampkcorrSimp.cv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *       Cryptographic protocol verifier                     *\n *                                                           *\n *       Bruno Blanchet and David Cad\u00e9                       *\n *                                                           *\n *       Copyright (C) ENS, CNRS, INRIA, 2005-2015           *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    Copyright ENS, CNRS, INRIA \n    contributors: Bruno Blanchet, Bruno.Blanchet@inria.fr\n                  David Cad\u00e9\n\nThis software is a computer program whose purpose is to verify \ncryptographic protocols in the computational model.\n\nThis software is governed by the CeCILL-B license under French law and\nabiding by the rules of distribution of free software.

Below is a textual description of the protocol that should effectively capture the details to allow someone familiar with the cv language to recreate the script.\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Description**\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe protocol is a cryptographic communication scheme inspired by the Woo and Lam public-key authentication protocol. The goal is to authenticate parties A and B using asymmetric key cryptography, specifically leveraging digital signatures.\n\n**Entities Involved:**  \n- Party A\n- Party B\n\n**Types and Parameters:**\n- **Types:**\n  - `nonce [large,fixed]`: A nonce to ensure freshness.\n  - `host [bounded]`: Represents a party or host identifier.\n  - `pkey [bounded]`: Public key type for asymmetric cryptography.\n  - `skey [bounded]`: Secret key corresponding to the public key.\n  - `keyseed [large,fixed]`: Seed for generating cryptographic keys.\n  - `seed [fixed]`: Seed used in signature operations.\n  - `signature [bounded]`: Signature type.\n  - `blocksize [fixed]`: Size of the data block.\n  - `blocksizebot [bounded]`: Another bounded block size type, possibly as a counterpart.\n- **Parameters:**\n  - `N, N2, N3, N4`: Used for replication or iteration purposes in process invocation.\n\n**Functions:**\n- `concat1(pkey, host, nonce): blocksize [compos]`: Combines a public key, host identifier, and nonce into a data block for signing.\n\n**Security Assumptions and Expansions:**\n- **UF_CMA_signature**: Model of cryptographic signature scheme under existential unforgeability under chosen message attack (UF-CMA). It involves key generation, signing, and signature verification functions, along with probabilistic measures `Psign` and `Psigncoll` for signature success and collision.\n\n**Events:**\n- `eA(pkey, host, nonce)`: An event indicating A's reception and processing of B's message containing a nonce.\n- `eB(pkey, host, nonce)`: An event indicating B's successful reception of A's message and nonce verification.\n\n**Queries:**\n- Checks that whenever B believes it has completed the protocol with public key `x` and host `y` who sent a nonce `z`, then an event `eA` must have occurred with the same values.\n- The injective queries ensure that for every `eB` event, there is a unique corresponding `eA` event, preventing replay attacks.\n\n**Protocol Execution:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - An initial input is taken on channel `c0`.\n   - A key seed `rkA` is generated, from which public and private keys `pkA` and `skA` are derived using `pkgen` and `skgen` functions.\n   - `pkA` is output on channel `c1`.\n\n2. **Process A:**\n   - Listens on channel `c2` for a nonce `xN` and host identifier `xB`.\n   - Records the occurrence of event `eA`.\n   - A fresh random seed `r` is generated for signature.\n   - Signs the concatenated message `(pkA, xB, xN)` and sends it via channel `c3`.\n\n3. **Process B:**\n   - Receives a public key `xpkA` on channel `c4`.\n   - Generates a new nonce `n`.\n   - Sends `(n, B)` on channel `c5`.\n   - Awaits a signature `s` on channel `c6`.\n   - Uses the `check` function to verify the signature `s` corresponds correctly to `(xpkA, B, n)`.\n     - If verification succeeds with `xpkA = pkA`, records event `eB`.\n\n**Execution Model:**\n- Multiple instances (`N`) of processes A and B run concurrently to simulate multiple protocol runs, ensuring parallelism and robustness against concurrent attack strategies.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive overview of the protocol's structure, facilitating the recreation of the original cv file using similar Cryptoverif constructs."]]}}
