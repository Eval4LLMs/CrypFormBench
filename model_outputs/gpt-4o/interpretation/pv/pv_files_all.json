The security goals are intended to protect certain messages, ensuring confidentiality by encrypting and signing them using public-key cryptographic operations. The protocol aims to ensure that a secret can only be accessed in a valid way by authorized participants.\n\n#### Participants and Variables:\n- `sA[], sB[], sS[]`: Secret keys of Alice, Bob, and the Server respectively.\n- `pk/1`: A function representing the public key associated with a secret key.\n- `encrypt/2`: A function to encrypt a message using a given key.\n- `sign/2`: A function to sign a message using a given key.\n- `host/1`: A function representing a host entity.\n- `sencrypt/2`: A function to symmetrically encrypt the secret using a key.\n\n#### Protocol Steps:\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - The announcement of public keys related to `sA[]`, `sB[]`, and `sS[]`.\n\n2. **Attacker Capabilities:**\n   - The attacker can decrypt messages encrypted with their public key.\n   - Access to the public key of any compromised entity is considered available to the attacker.\n   - The attacker can perform encryption, signing, and symmetric encryption with any known data.\n\n3. **Protocol Execution:**\n\n   - **Entity A:**\n     - Alice signs the tuple `(host(sA[]), pk(sA[]))` with her secret key `sS[]` and signs an external `(host(x), pk(x))` with `sS[]`.\n     - Alice creates an encrypted message containing the signed key `k[pk(x)]` with the recipient's public key `pk(x)` and sends it.\n\n   - **Entity B:**\n     - Bob validates the signature from Alice on the tuple `(host(sA[]), pk(s1))` and `(host(sB[]), pk(sB[]))`.\n     - Bob decrypts the message encrypted with his public key and produces a symmetric encryption of the intended secret using `k`.\n\n   - **Server Role:**\n     - Validates hosts by signing them using its public key `sS[]`.\n\n#### Security Goals:\n\nThe main security goal is to ensure the confidentiality of a message denoted as `secret[]`. The ProVerif query `c:secret[]` tests whether an attacker can access the secret.\n\n#### Expected Outcome:\n\nThe ending comment indicates that the goal `c:secret[]` is reachable within the protocol, suggesting a vulnerability that allows a successful compromise of the confidentiality assertion.\n\nThis description outlines how to generate the corresponding horn file as provided, capturing the logical interactions, cryptographic operations, and attacker assumptions defined within the protocol."]]}, "PV-1/DH.pv": {"code": [[true, "free c : channel.\n\nfree objective : bitstring [private]. // The objective bitstring is secret.\n\nfun exp(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring. // Exponentiation function.\nfun mod(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring. // Modulo operation.\n\nequation forall P:bitstring, G:bitstring, x:bitstring, y:bitstring;\n  mod(exp(exp(G, x), y), P) = mod(exp(exp(G, y), x), P). // Diffie-Hellman property: commutativity of exponentiation and modulus.\n\nfun enc(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring. // Encryption function.\nfun dec(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring. // Decryption function.\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\n  dec(enc(m, k), k) = m. // Correctness equation for encryption and decryption using the same key.\n\nquery attacker(objective). // Security query: can the attacker learn the objective?\n\nlet A = \n  new P:bitstring; // Generate a new prime P.\n  new G:bitstring; // Generate a new generator G.\n  new Na:bitstring; // Generate a new nonce Na by A.\n  out(c, (P, G)); (* 1. *) // Step 1: A sends (P, G) to B.\n  out(c, mod(exp(G, Na), P)); (* 2. *) // Step 2: A sends its public value computed using Na.\n  in(c, B : bitstring); // A receives B's public value.\n  let s = mod(exp(B, Na), P) in // Compute the shared secret s using B's public value.\n  out(c, enc(objective, s)). // Encrypt and send the objective using the shared secret.\n\nlet B = \n  new Nb:bitstring; // Generate a new nonce Nb by B.\n  in(c, (P : bitstring, G : bitstring)); (* 1. *) // Step 1: B receives (P, G) from A.\n  in(c, A : bitstring); (* 2. *) // Step 2: B receives A's public value.\n  out(c, mod(exp(G, Nb), P)); (* 3. *) // Step 3: B sends its public value back to A.\n  let s = mod(exp(A, Nb), P) in // Compute the shared secret s using A's public value.\n  0. // No further communication from B.\n\nprocess A | B  // The process consists of parallel execution of A and B.", "Certainly!

The protocol makes use of basic cryptographic primitives, such as modular exponentiation and symmetric key encryption.\n\n**Entities:**\n- **A**: An initiator who wants to share a secret message securely.\n- **B**: A responder who cooperates with A to establish a shared secret.\n\n**Communication Channel:**\n- A public channel `c` is used for communication. This channel is assumed to be accessible by an attacker.\n\n**Cryptographic Functions:**\n- `exp(base, exponent)`: Computes exponentiation.\n- `mod(value, modulus)`: Computes the remainder of division of 'value' by 'modulus' (i.e., modular reduction).\n- `enc(message, key)`: Encrypts a message using a symmetric key.\n- `dec(ciphertext, key)`: Decrypts a ciphertext using a symmetric key.\n- An equation ensures that decryption is the inverse of encryption: `dec(enc(m, k), k) = m`.\n\n**Key Exchange Steps:**\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - A selects a large prime number `P` and a generator `G`.\n   - A generates a random nonce `Na`.\n   - A sends `(P, G)` to B over the channel.\n\n2. **A's Public Value:**\n   - A computes its public value `A = mod(exp(G, Na), P)` and sends it to B.\n\n3. **B's Computation:**\n   - B generates a random nonce `Nb`.\n   - B receives `(P, G)` and A's public value.\n   - B computes its own public value `B = mod(exp(G, Nb), P)` and sends it back to A.\n\n4. **Shared Secret Derivation:**\n   - A computes the shared secret `s = mod(exp(B, Na), P)`.\n   - B computes the shared secret `s = mod(exp(A, Nb), P)`.\n   - Due to modular exponentiation properties, A and B derive the same shared secret `s`.\n\n5. **Secure Message Transmission:**\n   - A encrypts the confidential message `objective` with the shared secret `s` and sends the ciphertext to B.\n\n**Security Goal:**\n- Ensure that the attacker cannot learn the `objective`, which is represented by the query `attacker(objective)`.\n\n**Process Definitions:**\n- `let A` and `let B`: Define the roles of A and B in the protocol execution.\n- The processes `A` and `B` run in parallel, denoted by `process A | B`.\n\nThis description can be used to reconstruct the corresponding PV file so it can be run by ProVerif, allowing security properties of the protocol to be analyzed, focusing on the confidentiality of the `objective`."]]}, "PV-1/NSPK-agree-A-to-B-secrecy.pv": {"code": [[true, "(* The code modeling key server interaction is copied from ProVerif's Needham-Schroeder examples *)\nfree c : channel.

Below is the description content for this protocol based on the PV file:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n#### Overview\nThis protocol involves interaction between two clients, `A` and `B`, and a trusted key retrieval server which allows these principals to exchange messages securely. The protocol leverages a mix of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic operations to ensure confidentiality and integrity of the exchanged messages.\n\n#### Entities\n- **Client A**: Initiates communication and attempts to obtain public keys to securely communicate with another party `B`.\n- **Client B**: Responds to client A's initiation and completes the secure message exchange.\n- **Key Retrieval Server**: A trusted server that holds and provides public keys upon request.\n- **Key Register Server**: Handles storage of public keys associated with each entity to facilitate key distribution.\n\n#### Cryptographic Primitives\n- **Symmetric Encryption/Decryption (`enc`/`dec`)**: Used to encrypt and decrypt messages with a shared secret key.\n- **Asymmetric Encryption/Decryption (`aenc`/`adec`)**: Used to encrypt and decrypt messages using public/private key pairs.\n- **Signing/Verification (`sign`/`checksign`)**: Used to sign messages and verify the authenticity of a message signature.\n- **Key Derivation (`pkey`)**: Derives a public key from a given private key.\n\n#### Protocol Steps\n1. **Key Registration**:\n   - Clients `A` and `B` register their public keys with the key register server using the keys table.\n\n2. **Client A Initiation**:\n   - Client `A` requests the public key of `I` (another identifier, presumably representing `B` or an intermediary) from the key retrieval server.\n   - Client `A` sends an encrypted nonce (`Na`) and its identifier `A` to `I`.\n   \n3. **Client B Processing**:\n   - `B`, upon receiving the initial encrypted message from `A`, decrypts it and retrieves `Na` and confirms `A`.\n   - `B` sends back an encrypted response including `Na` and a fresh nonce `Nb`.\n   \n4. **Completion of Exchange**:\n   - `A` decrypts the response, validates `Nb`, and sends it back encrypted to `B`.\n   - `B` verifies this `Nb` to finalize and ensure the integrity of the interaction.\n\n#### Security Goals\n- **Confidentiality** of the nonces `Na` and `Nb` which ensures mutual challenge response and verifies the liveness of the communication.\n- **Integrity and Authentication** through digital signatures and fresh nonces ensuring that no man-in-the-middle can alter the message.\n- **Key Privacy** by utilizing asymmetric cryptography ensuring only intended participants can view certain parts of the protocol.\n\n#### Assumptions\n- The key retrieval server is trusted.\n- The communication channel `c` is controlled by the protocol and respects the limitations placed by cryptographic operations (though the channel itself may be insecure).\n\n#### ProVerif Queries\n- The protocol specifies a query to ensure that an attacker cannot simultaneously know the new nonce `Nb` and a private objective bitstring, which would breach protocol confidentiality.\n\nThis description intends to capture the essence of the protocol implemented in the provided ProVerif file while ensuring that every detail necessary for understanding and potentially recreating the ProVerif model is taken into account."]]}, "PV-1/NSLPK-secrecy.pv": {"code": [[true, "(* The code modeling key server interaction is copied from ProVerif's Needham-Schroeder examples *)\n\n(* Define a free channel for communication *)\nfree c : channel.\n\n(* Identifiers for participants *)\nfree A : bitstring.\nfree B : bitstring.\nfree I : bitstring.\n\n(* Function to compute the public key from a private key *)\nfun pkey(bitstring) : bitstring.\n\n(* Table to store keys corresponding to each participant *)\ntable keys(bitstring, bitstring).\n\n(* Crypto primitives for the trusted server *)\n\n(* Signature and verification functions *)\nfun sign(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\nfun checksign(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\n\n(* Function to extract a message from a signature *)\nfun getmess(bitstring) : bitstring.\n\n(* Equations representing the correctness of signing and verification *)\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;

Below is a description of the protocol, representing its significant elements and processes:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description\n\nThis protocol involves three primary roles: Client A, Client B, and a Key Server. The protocol enables secure communication between two clients, A and B, with the assistance of the Key Server.\n\n#### Roles and Functions\n\n1. **Clients (A and B)**\n   - Each client generates a new session nonce at the start of the protocol to ensure freshness in communications.\n   - The clients use asymmetric encryption (public/private keys) for securing messages exchanged between them with the help of the server.\n   - Both clients perform the following operations:\n     - **Client A**:\n       1. Queries for Client B's public key.\n       2. Encrypts a freshly generated nonce together with its identity using Client B's public key and sends it to B.\n       3. Receives a response from B, decrypts it with its private key, retrieves the nonce generated by B, and returns it encrypted with B's public key.\n     - **Client B**:\n       1. Queries for Client A's public key.\n       2. Sends a response containing A\u2019s nonce, its nonce, and its identity encrypted with A\u2019s public key upon receiving A\u2019s initial message.\n       3. Verifies the nonce sent by A in the received message and completes the protocol.\n\n2. **Key Server**\n   - Acts as a trusted intermediary that maintains a table of registered clients and their corresponding public keys.\n   - Provides registered clients' public keys to other requesting clients upon query.\n\n3. **Key Management**\n   - Utilizes asymmetric cryptographic functions for encryption (`aenc`) and decryption (`adec`) as well as digital signatures (`sign` and `checksign` for signing and verification, respectively).\n   - Relies on a public key infrastructure to authenticate the source of public keys distributed (ensured using digital signatures).\n\n#### Protocol Processes\n\n- **Key Retrieval Server**: Provides public keys for clients upon request. It authenticates the correctness of the provided keys using its own secret key for signing the data and the corresponding public key for verification.\n- **Key Register Server**: Allows registration of new clients by storing their public keys in the `keys` table, provided they are not predefined roles (A or B).\n- **Client A Process**: Initiates protocol execution by requesting and verifying public keys before engaging in encrypted communication.\n- **Client B Process**: Waits for an encrypted initiation from A, subsequently sends encrypted responses containing session nonces as per the protocol specifications.\n\n#### Protocol Assertions\n\n- The protocol model includes a security query to check that a new nonce generated by Client B (`Nb`) remains confidential to the attacker. This is expressed using the `query attacker(new Nb)` statement, where the objective is to ensure that `Nb` is not learnable by potential adversaries.\n\n---\n\nWith this description, anyone familiar with the ProVerif tool and cryptographic protocols should be able to reconstruct the given `.pv` file, ensuring the correct modeling of protocol interactions and security objectives."]]}, "PV-1/OtwayRees.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Below is a structured description of the protocol, which outlines the essential elements and processes required to model it in ProVerif:\n\n#### Participants\n- **A**: Initiator (an honest host, predefined)\n- **B**: Responder (an honest host, predefined)\n- **S**: Trusted Server\n- **Intruder**: Capable of intercepting and attempting to compromise communication.\n\n#### Communication Model\n- **Channel `c`:** All communications occur over this unsecured but controlled channel.\n\n#### Data Types\n- **`key`:** Used to represent keys for encryption purposes.\n- **`host`:** Used to represent entities or hosts, such as A, B, and S.\n- **`nonce`:** Nonce values used for ensuring freshness in messages.\n\n#### Cryptographic Primitives\n- **`encrypt(bitstring, key): bitstring`**: Represents asymmetric encryption.\n- **`decrypt`:** The inverse operation, defined by the equation:\n  - `decrypt(encrypt(x, y), y) = x` for message `x` and key `y`.\n\n#### Protocol Steps\n\n1. **Initiator (A) -> Responder (B):** \n   - A sends a message to B containing a concatenation `(C, A, B, {Na, C, A, B}_kA)`, where:\n     - `C`: nonce for correlation\n     - `Na`: nonce generated by A\n     - `{Na, C, A, B}_kA`: Nonce `Na` and identifiers encrypted with A's key `kA`.\n\n2. **Responder (B) -> Server (S):** \n   - B forwards the initiator\u2019s message to S, adding its own nonce:\n     - `(C, A, B, {Na, C, A, B}_kA, {Nb, C, A, B}_kB)`, where:\n       - `Nb`: nonce generated by B.\n\n3. **Server (S) -> Responder (B):**\n   - S, upon receiving the message, checks and decrypts both encrypted parts.\n   - If successful, S generates a new session key `k` and sends the message:\n     - `(C, {Na, k}_kA, {Nb, k}_kB)` back to B.\n\n4. **Responder (B) -> Initiator (A):**\n   - B forwards part of the server\u2019s response to A:\n     - `(C, {Na, k}_kA)` to A, allowing A to confirm the established session key `k`.\n\n#### Security Properties\n- **Secrecy Assumptions:** \n  - `Kas` and `Kbs` represent keys shared between A and the server, and B and the server, respectively. These keys must remain secret from attackers.\n\n#### Queries\n- **Non-Interference:** The confidentiality of secrets `secretA` and `secretB` is analyzed:\n  - `noninterf secretA` checks non-interference of secret `A`.\n  - `noninterf secretB` checks non-interference of secret `B`.\n  - `noninterf secretA, secretB` checks joint non-interference, which is harder to establish.\n\n#### ProVerif Implementation Details\n\n- **Free Variables**: `A`, `B`, `secretA`, `secretB`.\n- **Key Registration**: Process `processK` allows the registration of keys for hosts not equal to `A` or `B`.\n- **Honest Participant Assumptions**: Only `A` and `B` are considered honest; keys are registered only for these.\n\n#### Protocol Realization\n- **Concurrent Execution**: Processes implement the roles of initiator, responder, and server, running concurrently:\n  - `!processInitiator`\n  - `!processResponder`\n  - `!processS`\n  - `!processK`\n\n#### Expected Security Results\n- The results imply partial success:\n  - `Non-interference secretA` and `secretB` are true.\n  - `Non-interference secretA, secretB` cannot be proved, indicating complexity in proving joint secrecy.\n\nThis structured description outlines the Otway-Rees protocol as implemented in the ProVerif tool and captures the key elements required for its reconstruction."]]}, "PV-1/piskeme.pi": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The protocol appears to be a cryptographic key exchange system using both public key cryptography and Diffie-Hellman key exchange, with hash functions for integrity checks.\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nThis protocol defines a cryptographic scheme leveraging various cryptographic primitives such as public key encryption, symmetric encryption, hashing, and Diffie-Hellman key exchange.\n\n**Entities:**\n- Two parties, A and B, aim to establish a secure communication channel.\n\n**Cryptographic Primitives Used:**\n- **Public Key Cryptography**: Functions `pk/1`, `encrypt/2`, and `decrypt/2` are defined to handle asymmetric encryption and decryption. The function `pk/1` seems to derive a public key from a secret key.\n- **Hash Function**: `hash/1` is used to create a deterministic output from input data. \n- **Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange**: `f/2` and `g/1` functions provide a basis for calculating shared secrets using the Diffie-Hellman mechanism. An equation ensures the commutative property typical for Diffie-Hellman.\n- **Keyed Hash Function**: `keyhash/2` is likely used for creating message authentication codes (MACs).\n- **Symmetric Key Cryptography**: Functions `sencrypt/2` and `sdecrypt/2` handle symmetric encryption and decryption, respectively.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - **A** and **B** each have secret keys (`skA`, `skB`) to derive their public keys (`pkA`, `pkB`).\n   - Both public keys are shared on a common channel `c`.\n\n2. **Process for Alice (A)**:\n   - **A** receives a public key `pkX` (which is intended to be **B**'s public key).\n   - **A** generates a fresh nonce `x` and a session key `Ka`. \n   - **A** sends an encrypted message using the public key `pkX`, containing its public key and session key, alongside `g(x)` (a Diffie-Hellman component).\n\n3. **Process for Bob (B)**:\n   - **B** receives the encrypted message and a Diffie-Hellman component `m2`.\n   - **B** decrypts the message to retrieve **A**'s public key and `Ka`.\n   - **B** generates its own session key `Kb`.\n   - **B** computes a shared Diffie-Hellman value `sh` and sends an encrypted confirmation with a new Diffie-Hellman component `g(y)` and a keyed hash for validation.\n   \n4. **Verification and Completion**:\n   - Both parties validate the received keyed hashes against their calculations.\n   - If validation succeeds, they derive a shared symmetric key for encrypting either `secretA` or `secretB` for secure communication.\n\n### Security Goals:\n\n- **Secrecy**: The protocol aims to keep `secretA` and `secretB` confidential.\n- **Authentication**: Keyed hashes ensure data integrity and authenticity between the parties.\n- **Key Exchange**: Securely agree on a shared session key using public key and Diffie-Hellman techniques.\n\n### Analysis Results:\n\nThe proverif analysis indicates:\n- Non-interference of `secretA` and `secretB` together cannot be proved, but independently each secrecy holds, largely suggesting individual security for `secretA` and `secretB` with respective counterparties.\n\nThis description outlines all necessary components to reconstruct the pi-calculus code for analysis in tools like ProVerif.

Here's the detailed description of the protocol as represented by your pi file:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\n1. **Participants:**\n   - A (Alice): The initiator of the communication.\n   - B (Bob): The responder or target of the communication.\n   - S (Server): A trusted party that helps establish and verify session details between A and B.\n\n2. **Keys and Encryption:**\n   - `kAS`: A shared key between A and S.\n   - `kBS`: A shared key between B and S.\n   - `encrypt(m, k)`: A function representing the encryption of message `m` with key `k`.\n   - `decrypt(m, k)`: A function that decrypts message `m` with key `k`, which is defined such that decrypting an encrypted message with the same key returns the original message.\n\n3. **Messages Exchanged (Protocol Steps):**\n   - **Step 1:** A -> B: A\n     - Alice initiates the communication by sending its identity to Bob.\n   - **Step 2:** B -> A: N (fresh)\n     - Bob responds with a freshly generated nonce `N` to Alice.\n   - **Step 3:** A -> B: {A, B, N}_kAS\n     - Alice sends Bob an encrypted message containing the identities (A and B) and Alice's nonce using the shared key `kAS`.\n   - **Step 4:** B -> S: {A, B, {A, B, N}_kAS}_kBS\n     - Bob forwards this encrypted message to the Server, further encrypting it with the shared key `kBS`.\n   - **Step 5:** S -> B: {A, B, N}_kBS\n     - The Server verifies the message and responds to Bob with the decrypted nonce, identities, all encrypted using `kBS`.\n   - **Step 6:** Bob verifies the message from the Server; an attack indicates a problem.\n\n### Processes in ProVerif\n\n1. `processA`: \n   - Represents Alice's behavior in the protocol, involving sending its identity, receiving the nonce, and sending encrypted confirmation to Bob.\n\n2. `processB`: \n   - Models Bob's role in the protocol, where Bob chooses a fresh nonce, interacts with Alice, sends a request to the Server, and verifies the returned message for correctness using the nonce and identities.\n\n3. `processS`: \n   - Implements the Server role, which accepts Bob's encrypted request, decrypts the included message using the shared keys, and returns the encrypted nonce confirmation to Bob.\n\n### Security Queries\n\nThe ProVerif script queries whether specific authentication properties hold:\n- The authenticity of the parameter exchange (begin and end events for parameter exchange).\n- The full authentication goals reflecting that if certain events end, they must have been correctly initiated.\n\n### Results\n\nThe `EXPECTPV` block at the end of the file reflects the evaluation results of ProVerif, indicating the verification conclusions:\n- Specific queries regarding event injections (`evinj:endBparam(x) ==> evinj:beginBparam(x)`) being false suggest potential attack vectors or failures in the intended protocol guarantees.\n\nThe protocol, as modeled, is expected to terminate with an attack, indicating ProVerif detected violations in specified properties, providing insights into vulnerabilities in the protocol under analysis.\n\nThis comprehensive description outlines the key facets and dynamics in the WooLam shared-key authentication protocol, correlating directly with the provided pi calculus model for verification using ProVerif."]]}, "PV-1/Skeme.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Below is a description of the elements and processes within this protocol that would help someone replicate or understand its implementation in ProVerif.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Entities:**\n- Two main entities, often referred to as Alice (A) and Bob (B), engage in a key exchange process. Each has its own private (skey) and public (pkey) keys.\n\n**Global Setup:**\n- A public channel `c` is used for communication.\n- Various types such as `nonce`, `pkey`, `skey`, `key`, and `exponent` are declared.\n- Functions for cryptographic operations are defined:\n  - `pk(skey)`: Generates a public key from a secret key.\n  - `encrypt`, `decrypt`: For public key encryption and decryption.\n  - `hash`: A hash function.\n  - `exp`: A function related to Diffie-Hellman for exponentiation.\n  - `keyhash`: A keyed hash function.\n  - `sencrypt`, `sdecrypt`: Shared key encryption and decryption.\n\n**Constants and Functions:**\n- `g`: A generator for the Diffie-Hellman protocol.\n- Equations and reductions define the behavior of cryptographic operations, ensuring decryption is inverse to encryption and the Diffie-Hellman shared secret is computed equivalently.\n\n**Security Assumptions:**\n- Private keys (`skA`, `skB`) and random exponents (`x`, `y`) used in Diffie-Hellman are assumed to be secure.\n- Specific secrets, `secretA` and `secretB`, are used to demonstrate non-interference. These are sensitive data that must remain confidential unless certain checks are satisfied.\n\n**Processes:**\n- `processA`: Executes Alice's part of the protocol:\n  1. Receives a public key `pkX`.\n  2. Generates a new exponent `x` and computes `gx = exp(g,x)`.\n  3. Creates a new nonce `Ka` and sends an encrypted message containing `(pkA, Ka)` and `gx`.\n  4. Awaits a pair of responses: a triple `(m1, m2, m3)`, verifies them.\n  5. Computes shared hash `K0` and shared secret `sh` and confirms valid message exchange.\n  6. Outputs an encrypted `secretA` only if the conditions of the protocol are satisfied.\n\n- `processB`: Executes Bob's part of the protocol:\n  1. Receives an initial message and decrypts to extract `(pkAr, Ka)`.\n  2. Generates a new nonce `Kb` and computes `K0`.\n  3. Selects an exponent `y` to derive `gy = exp(g, y)`.\n  4. Computes shared secret `sh` and sends a response verifying the exchange.\n  5. Awaits and verifies the final part of protocol; if successful, outputs an encrypted `secretB`.\n\n**Main Process:**\n- Initializes secret keys and public keys for Alice and Bob.\n- Broadcasts these public keys to the channel.\n- Runs Alice and Bob's processes in parallel, allowing multiple instances of these functions.\n\n**Security Goals:**\n- Non-interference of `secretA` and `secretB` ensures the secrecy of these keys is preserved unless explicitly revealed by the correct protocol interaction.\n\nThis ProVerif file is set up to demonstrate the cryptographic operations and exchanges that happen in a key exchange protocol like SKEME. The output expectations at the end of the file suggest running the prover to check the non-interference of secret A and B to determine if these secrets can remain confidential given the defined security model."]]}, "PV-1/WooLamPK.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Below is a detailed description of this protocol and its implementation in ProVerif, facilitating the creation of a corresponding ProVerif file based on this description.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Participants:**\n- **A**: Initiator\n- **B**: Responder\n- **S**: Server\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n1. A sends its identity to B.\n   - **Message**: A -> B: A\n2. B generates a fresh nonce, N, and sends it to A.\n   - **Message**: B -> A: N\n3. A signs the nonce using its private key and sends the signed nonce back to B.\n   - **Message**: A -> B: {N}_skA\n4. B forwards A\u2019s identity to the server S.\n   - **Message**: B -> S: A\n5. S returns A\u2019s identity along with A\u2019s public key signed by the server\u2019s private key.\n   - **Message**: S -> B: A, {A, pkA}_skS\n\n### Security Properties\n\n- **Authenticity**: Ensures that B can confirm the identity of A.\n- **Secrecy**: The private keys (skA, skB, skS) and nonces must remain confidential.\n\n### ProVerif Implementation\n\n1. **Channel and Types Declaration**: Defines a communication channel `c` and types for host, nonce, and keys.\n\n2. **Functions and Reductions**:\n   - Implements key-pair generation and signing mechanisms with `pk`, `sign`, `getmess`, and `checksign` functions. Defines confidentiality assumptions with `not attacker(new skA)` for keys.\n\n3. **Host and Key Table**:\n   - Declares `A` and `B` as honest hosts.\n   - Uses a `keys` table to store host-public key pairs.\n\n4. **Events and Queries**:\n   - Implements events such as `beginBparam` and `endBparam` for authenticity verification and defines queries to check if these events are logically consistent and verify authenticity.\n\n5. **Roles**:\n   - **Initiator (A)**: Simulates the actions of A including signing the received nonce.\n   - **Responder (B)**: Simulates B\u2019s role including nonce generation and signature validation.\n   - **Server (S)**: Responsible for providing the public key of A signed with its server key.\n   - **Key Registration**: Handles registration of non-A or non-B hosts.\n\n6. **Main Process**:\n   - Initializes secret keys, derives public keys, registers them, and launches the processes for the initiator, responder, and server in parallel.\n\n### Analysis (EXPECTED RESULTS)\n\nThe `EXPECTPV` section indicates that the authenticity properties represented by the queries are violated, meaning an attacker can break the authentication property as defined.\n\n### ProVerif File Generation\n\nTo generate a ProVerif file, you would follow this description and utilize the syntax for declaring variables, processes, and queries to construct a .pv script. Ensure the setup matches the protocol steps correctly and defines confidentiality constraints accurately. The given ProVerif script is a direct implementation of the Woo and Lam protocol focusing on security verifications and potential vulnerabilities that can be analyzed using the ProVerif tool."]]}, "PV-1/Yahalom.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

Here's a high-level description of the protocol based on this file, which will help you or anyone else to recreate the ProVerif code from this description:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nThe Yahalom protocol is designed for key exchange between two parties, traditionally labeled as A (the initiator) and B (the responder), with the aid of a trusted server S. The protocol facilitates mutual authentication and the establishment of a session key between these two parties.\n\n### Participants\n- **A**: The initiator, trying to establish communication with B.\n- **B**: The responder, receiving a request from A and contacting S.\n- **S**: The server, trusted to share keys with A and B and assist in key establishment.\n\n### Data Types\n- **host**: Represents a participant in the protocol (e.g., A, B).\n- **nonce**: A random value used for ensuring the freshness of messages.\n- **key**: Represents cryptographic keys used for secure communication.\n- **bitstring**: Generic data type for encrypted and plain messages.\n\n### Key Assumptions\n- Each participant shares a secret key with the server (A shares `Kas`, B shares `Kbs`).\n- Nonces (`Na`, `Nb`) are generated by A and B to add freshness.\n- There is an encryption function `encrypt` and a corresponding decryption capability dependent on the shared keys.\n\n### Message Flow in the Protocol\n1. **A -> B**: A initiates the protocol by sending its identity and a fresh nonce (`Na`) to B.\n2. **B -> S**: B forwards a message to the server, encrypted with its shared key `Kbs`, including A's identity, `Na`, and a new nonce `Nb`.\n3. **S -> A**: The server sends back to A a message encrypted with `Kas`, which includes identities, the session key `Kab`, and both nonces `Na` and `Nb`. It also includes another message for B encrypted with `Kbs`.\n4. **A -> B**: A forwards the encrypted message meant for B and proves knowledge of `Nb`.\n\n### Security Goals\n- **Confidentiality**: Ensure that the session key `Kab` and secrets (`secretA`, `secretB`) are kept secret from the attacker.\n- **Non-interference**: Ensure that the secrets are independent of the inputs controlled by an attacker.\n\n### Processes\n- `processInitiator`: Manages A's role, handles message exchanges, and checks received messages.\n- `processResponder`: Manages B's role, exchanges messages, and verifies contents.\n- `processS`: Simulates the server, which generates session keys and prepares messages for A and B.\n- `processK`: Handles the registration of new keys, ensuring only unknown hosts can register.\n\n### Verification Queries\n- The script attempts to prove secrecy and non-interference properties for two secrets (`secretA` and `secretB`).\n\n### Expected Results\n- Results from ProVerif include partial non-interference proofs, indicating that the system cannot entirely assure non-interference under the given model settings.\n\nThis description gives a comprehensive understanding of the Yahalom protocol's model as presented in your ProVerif file.

Below is a description of the protocol that you can use to generate the corresponding pi calculus file that can be run by ProVerif:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Entities and Assumptions:**\n- **A, B, S**: The principal entities in the protocol, representing Alice, Bob, and the Server, respectively.\n- **Shared Keys**: Each principal shares a unique symmetric key with the Server:\n  - `Kas`: Key shared between Alice and the Server.\n  - `Kbs`: Key shared between Bob and the Server.\n- **Nonces**: Random values used to ensure freshness:\n  - `Na`: Nonce generated by Alice.\n  - `Nb`: Nonce generated by Bob.\n- **Session Key**: `Kab` is the session key generated by the Server to secure communication between Alice and Bob after mutual authentication.\n\n**Protocol Messages:**\n1. **A \u2192 B**: `A, N_A`\n   - Alice initiates the protocol by sending its identity and a fresh nonce `Na` to Bob.\n\n2. **B \u2192 S**: `B, N_B, {A, N_A}_Kbs`\n   - Bob generates a fresh nonce `Nb` and sends his identity, `Nb`, and the encrypted tuple of Alice\u2019s identity and nonce `Na` (encrypted with `Kbs`) to the Server.\n\n3. **S \u2192 A**: `N_B, {B, K_ab, N_A}_Kas, {A, K_ab, N_B}_Kbs`\n   - The Server decrypts Bob's request, verifies the nonce, generates a session key `Kab`, and sends to Alice:\n     - Bob's nonce `Nb`, the session key `Kab`, and Alice\u2019s nonce (all encrypted with `Kas`).\n     - Bob's identity, the session key `Kab`, and `Nb` (encrypted with `Kbs`).\n\n4. **A \u2192 B**: `{A, K_ab, N_B}_Kbs, {N_B}_Kab`\n   - Alice decrypts the received message, and if all checks are correct, forwards to Bob:\n     - Her identity, the session key `Kab`, and Bob's nonce (encrypted with `Kbs`).\n     - Bob\u2019s nonce encrypted with `Kab`.\n\n**Security Goals:**\n- **Secrecy**: The protocol aims to secure `Kab`, `secretA`, and `secretB` such that the attacker cannot deduce these secrets.\n- **Authentication**:\n  - Agreement on the identity of `B` and on the session key `Kab` by ensuring event-based correspondence assertions.\n  - `endAparam` and `endBparam` signify completion of parameter exchanges verified to be consistent with their respective beginnings (`beginAparam` and `beginBparam`).\n\n**Cryptographic Primitives:**\n- **Symmetric Encryption/Decryption**: Defined with constructors and destructors (`encrypt/2` and `decrypt/2`).\n- **Host Names/Keys Mappings**: Using functions and private reductions for host names (e.g., `host/1`, `getkey`).\n\n**Security Queries:**\n- **Secrecy**: Check that an attacker cannot obtain `secretA` or `secretB`.\n- **Authenticity**: Verify the event correspondence between start and completion events for participant states.\n\nUsing this description and understanding of the protocol, you can now write the pi calculus representation that matches the provided protocol for use in ProVerif."]]}, "PV-1/denning-sacco-orig.horntype": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

The protocol involves three main roles: A (a client), B (another client), and a server S. Each participant possesses a secret key (`skey`), and the server knows the public keys of each participant. Here's a breakdown of the protocol specification:\n\n#### Types and Functions\n\n1. **Types:**\n   - `skey`: Represents a secret key.\n   - `pkey`: Represents a public key.\n   - `host`: Represents a participant's identity or address.\n   - `key`: Represents a session key used for symmetric encryption.\n\n2. **Functions:**\n   - `pk(skey): pkey`: Generates a public key from a secret key.\n   - `encrypt(bitstring, pkey): bitstring`: Encrypts a message with a public key.\n   - `sign(bitstring, skey): bitstring`: Signs a message with a secret key.\n   - `sencrypt(bitstring, key): bitstring`: Symmetric encryption of a message using a key.\n   - `host(skey): host`: Maps a secret key to a host identifier.\n   - `key_to_bitstring(key): bitstring`: Converts a key to a bitstring representation.\n\n#### Names\n\n- `secret`: The secret data that B wants to protect.\n- `sA`, `sB`, `sS`: Secret keys for A, B, and Server S respectively.\n- `k`: A symmetric key used for session encryption.\n\n#### Predicates and Queries\n\n- `pred c(any_type)`: A predicate used to denote that an entity can be computed or is accessible to the attacker.\n- `query c(secret[])`: Queries the system to check if the secret can be derived by the attacker.\n\n#### Clauses\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Public keys of A, B, and S are published and assumed accessible (`c(pk(sA))`, `c(pk(sB))`, `c(pk(sS))`).\n\n2. **Attacker Capabilities:**\n   - An attacker can decrypt messages if they possess the corresponding secret key.\n   - Given access to a secret key, an attacker can derive the associated public key.\n   - The attacker can create signatures if they have the message and secret key.\n\n3. **Protocol Steps:**\n   - **Step A (Initiator Client):**\n     - A sends a message, which includes signatures of its own identity and that of another party, encrypted with the recipient's public key.\n   \n   - **Step B (Recipient Client):**\n     - Upon receiving a correctly signed message, B derives the session key and encrypts the secret data with this session key.\n   \n   - **Server's Role:**\n     - The server signs and confirms the identities and public keys of clients, establishing authenticity.\n\n---\n\nThis protocol ensures the confidentiality and authenticity of communications through the use of cryptographic functions.

It involves two participants, `A` (initiator) and `B` (responder), potentially communicating over an insecure channel. The primary goal is to authenticate each participant to the other using a shared password. Here are the key components of the protocol:\n\n### Entities\n- **Host Names:** Every participant is identified by a unique host name. In this protocol, `A` and `B` are constants representing host names.\n- **Passwords:** Every pair of communicating entities shares a password. `PAB`, `PAA`, and `PBB` are shared passwords.\n- **Keys:** Participants use both public/private key pairs and symmetric keys in the protocol.\n\n### Channels\n- **Channel `c`:** A public channel over which all communication takes place. Messages sent over this channel could be intercepted by an adversary.\n\n### Types\n- `host`, `passwd`, `nonce`, `pkey`, `skey`, `key`: Defined as basic data types for hosts, passwords, nonces, public keys, secret keys, and symmetric keys respectively.\n\n### Functions\n- **Symmetric Encryption:**\n  - `enc` and `dec`: Encrypt and decrypt using a password. These functions are modeled so that decryption with an incorrect password produces an indistinguishable wrong result.\n- **Strong Symmetric Encryption:**\n  - `senc` and `sdec`: Encrypt and decrypt using a symmetric key, but unlike `enc`/`dec`, decryption is guaranteed to succeed with the correct key.\n- **Public Key Encryption:**\n  - `penc` and `pdec`: Encrypt and decrypt a key using public/private key pairs.\n- **Type Converters:**\n  - `nonce_to_bitstring`, `pkey_to_bitstring`: Convert nonces and public keys to bitstrings for encoding.\n\n### Process Descriptions\n**Initiator's Process `processA`:**\n- Generates a new secret/encryption key pair.\n- Sends its host identifier and an encrypted version of its public key to the responder.\n- Receives a message, decrypts and extracts a key, uses one-time nonce challenge.\n- Engages in a nonce exchange to ensure mutual authentication.\n\n**Responder's Process `processB`:**\n- Receives a message with host identifier and encrypted public key.\n- Decrypts to extract the public key.\n- Sends an encrypted message with a newly generated session key.\n- Engages in nonce exchange to complete mutual authentication.\n\n### Protocol Execution\nThe parallel composition of processes is considered:\n- Multiple instances of `processA` and `processB` are running, each potentially handling different communications.\n- Some processes simulate communication with an adversary, considering no secrets are shared with the adversary other than the password.\n\n### Security Property\n- **Observational Equivalence:** The protocol verifies whether an adversary can distinguish between the real password and a fresh password.\n  \n### Notes\n- The ProVerif script defines a set of conditions under which an attack is possible and explores whether the real executions of the protocol uphold privacy expectations.\n- Observational equivalence checks are used to validate the protocol's resistance to password guessing by measuring if two different executions (using a real password and a dummy/alternative one) can be distinguished by an adversary.\n\n### Conclusion\nThe analysis concludes that the protocol maintains observing an adversary showing that distinguishing between the real and alternative password is computationally infeasible under these model assumptions.\n\n---\n\nThis description encapsulates key elements of the protocol and describes how you might generate a corresponding ProVerif specification."]]}, "PV-1/needham.horn": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

This description should assist in reverse-engineering the corresponding Horn file specification.\n\n### Protocol Description\n\nThe protocol involves two main participants, denoted by private keys `skA` and `skB`. The protocol makes use of asymmetric encryption functions, specifically:\n\n- **Public Key Function**: `pk/1` - This unary function maps a secret key to a public key.\n- **Encryption Function**: `encrypt/2` - This binary function encrypts data using a specified key.\n\n### Protocol Predicates\n\n- **begin/1**: Represents the start of a process with a single argument, typically the nonce or session identifier.\n- **c/1**: Represents a cryptographic term which is subjected to transformation via ProVerif rules for elimination and decomposition (`elimVar, decompData`).\n- The special directive `nounif c:x` prevents unification on terms matched by `c`.\n\n### Protocol Queries\n\n- **end:x,y**: This denotes the end goal of the protocol analysis, usually the eventual reception or verification of some terms to verify security properties or correctness.\n\n### Reduction Rules\n\nThe described reductions (Horn clauses) below dictate how terms transform throughout the protocol:\n\n1. **Compound Encryption Rule**:\n   - Matches a compound encryption scenario where a message wrapped inside two encryptions eventually leads to a conclusion marked by `end`. It matches `c:encrypt(Nb[encrypt((v9, pk(skA[])), pk(skB[])), v10], pk(skB[]))`.\n   - Derives the relation to an end state with terms `(v10), (v9, pk(skA[]), pk(skB[]), Nb[encrypt((v9, pk(skA[])), pk(skB[])), v10])`.\n\n2. **Message Re-encryption Rule**:\n   - Matches an encryption involving keys corresponding to `pk(skB[])`. It results in terms handling nonces, expressed as `Nb[encrypt((v6, v7), pk(skB[])), v8]`.\n\n3. **Begin-Encrypt Link**:\n   - Connects the initiation predicate `begin` to a specific encryption routine.\n   - For any established `begin`, an encrypted term with `pk(skA[])` is necessary along with a condition `c:v3`.\n\n4. **Initializer Rule**:\n   - Governs the creation/encryption of a comprehensive message including public keys and nonces.\n\n5. **Public Key Presence**:\n   - Establishes that the public keys `pk(skA[])` and `pk(skB[])` are part of the working environment of the protocol.\n\n6. **Cryptographic Transmission Conditions**:\n   - The rules enable encryption/decryption transformations when coupling various terms with their public/private counterparts.\n\n### Security Properties\n\nThe primary security concerns assessed by this protocol revolve around ensuring that compound encrypted messages can eventually reach a known secure end state (`end:x, y`). The protocol likely aims to validate confidentiality and integrity properties by observing transformations across encrypted messages through transitions validated by these Horn clauses.\n\nThe `c:any` and `c:any#` constructions in the last transformation rule denote placeholder terms that might refer to arbitrary principal names or cryptographic data, ensuring the protocol can generalize across diverse operational scenarios.\n\nThe protocol breakdown as described will provide a foundation upon which one can reconstruct the Horn clause rules to verify its mechanics within ProVerif.

The relationship is defined as:\n  - `decrypt(encrypt(x, y), y) = x`.\n\n##### Security Assumptions\n- The protocol assumes:\n  - The keys `Kas` (for initiator) and `Kbs` (for responder) are secure and not known to attackers.\n\n##### Participants and Key Management\n- Two trusted hosts, `A` and `B`, are defined, which can communicate securely.\n- A table `keys`, mapping hosts to their shared keys with the server, is maintained.\n\n##### Security Queries\n- Verify that:\n  - The session secrets `secretA` and `secretB` remain confidential and not accessible by attackers.\n  - Correctness of the protocol with events: any `end` event must be preceded by its corresponding `begin` event for both parameters and keys, for each participant.\n\n##### Constants\n- Tag constants: `c0`, `c1` are used to mark message parts during the exchange.\n\n##### Protocol Roles\n\n1. **Initiator Role**:\n   - Session begins when an initiator with identity `xA` and a partner `h` are chosen.\n   - Check and retrieve the shared key if `xA` is `A` or `B`.\n   - Initiates communication by sending a nonce `Na`.\n   - Responds to incoming messages by decrypting them with the shared key.\n   - Establishes and confirms the session secret using symmetric encryption authenticated with `h`.\n\n2. **Responder Role**:\n   - Session begins when a responder with identity `xB` is selected.\n   - Similar verification of identity and retrieval of the shared key.\n   - Responds to initial nonce message by sending its own nonce `Nb`.\n   - Confirms the nonce from the initiator.\n   - Securely encrypts session secret with the shared key.\n\n3. **Server Role**:\n   - Manages requests for key establishment by generating a new session key.\n   - Encrypts the session key suitable for both the initiator and the responder.\n   \n4. **Key Registration**:\n   - Allows registering new hosts and keys, ensuring they are not `A` or `B`.\n\n##### Protocol Execution\nThe protocol executes with:\n- Initiator, responder, server roles, and key registration processes executing concurrently and unbounded times which emulate multiple sessions.\n\n##### Verification Results\n- The ProVerif tool verifies the confidentiality of session secrets (`secretA`, `secretB`), and the correctness of protocol steps via event queries, ensuring serialized execution of key and parameter exchanges.\n\nUsing the above description, you should be able to construct, understand, and verify the Needham-Schroeder shared key protocol in the ProVerif tool."]]}, "PV-1/NSLPK-agree-A-to-B.pv": {"code": [[true, "(* The code modeling key server interaction is copied from ProVerif's Needham-Schroeder examples *)\nfree c : channel.\n\n(* Define principal identities as bitstrings. *)\nfree A : bitstring.\nfree B : bitstring.\nfree I : bitstring.\n\n(* Public key function definition. *)\nfun pkey(bitstring) : bitstring.\n\n(* Table to store keys associated with identities. *)\ntable keys(bitstring, bitstring).\n\n(* Cryptographic primitives for the trusted server. *)\nfun sign(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\nfun checksign(bitstring, bitstring) : bitstring.\nfun getmess(bitstring) : bitstring.\nequation forall m:bitstring, k:bitstring;\n  checksign(sign(m,k), pkey(k)) = m.

The annotations are constructed to not interfere with the protocol execution when run by ProVerif."]], "logic": [[true, "The provided ProVerif code represents a protocol involving key server interactions, with elements inspired by the Needham-Schroeder public-key protocol. Here's a detailed description of the protocol based on the code:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nThis protocol involves three primary participants: Clients A and B, and a trusted Key Server that facilitates key management. The key functionalities include public key retrieval, message encryption, and signature verification to ensure secure communication between the clients. The primary objective is to demonstrate how keys are retrieved and managed, and messages are securely exchanged using cryptographic primitives.\n\n### Participants and Variables\n\n- **Channels:**\n  - `c`: The main communication channel used for message exchanges between clients and the server.\n\n- **Free Variables:**\n  - `A`, `B`, `I`: Identifiers representing the participants (e.g., client names or identifiers).\n\n- **Functions and Cryptographic Primitives:**\n  - `pkey`: Function to derive the public key from a secret key.\n  - `sign` and `checksign`: Functions to sign messages and verify signatures.\n  - `enc` and `dec`: Symmetric encryption and decryption functions.\n  - `aenc` and `adec`: Asymmetric encryption and decryption functions, using public keys for encryption and private keys for decryption.\n\n- **Objective:**\n  - `objective`: A private bitstring that represents information which the attacker queries, indicating a potential security target or vulnerability.\n\n### Protocol Steps\n\n1. **Key Registration:**\n   - Each client and server has a key pair (private key `sk` and public key `pk`).\n   - The server maintains a table of registered keys, storing public keys associated with client identifiers.\n\n2. **Client A's Interaction:**\n   - Generates a nonce, `Na`.\n   - Requests and retrieves the public key of a communication partner `I` from the server, verifying the server's signature.\n   - Encrypts and sends `(Na, A)` to `I`.\n   - Receives a response from `I`, decrypts it, and verifies the nonce.\n   - Sends back acknowledgment encrypted with `I`'s public key.\n\n3. **Client B's Interaction:**\n   - Generates a nonce, `Nb`.\n   - Requests and retrieves the public key of `A` from the server, verifying the server's signature.\n   - Receives an encrypted message from `A`, extracts and verifies the nonce.\n   - Responds with an encrypted message `(Na, Nb, B)` to `A`.\n   - Receives and verifies acknowledgment from `A` using its own nonce.\n\n4. **Key Retrieval Server Functionality:**\n   - Listens for requests to retrieve public keys.\n   - Responds with a signed key pair for requested identifiers.\n\n5. **Key Registration Server Functionality:**\n   - Listens for new key registration requests.\n   - Updates the key table except for the hardcoded clients `A` and `B`.\n\n### Security Queries\n\n- **Security Query:** `query attacker(objective)`: This query checks if an attacker can derive the `objective` bitstring.

Let's break down the protocol modeled in the provided pi file, describe its components and operations, and compile a description that could guide you to reconstruct this ProVerif code. Here's the detailed explanation:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Protocol Name**: Woo and Lam Public-Key Authentication Protocol\n\n**Protocol Overview**:\n\nThe Woo and Lam protocol is a public-key authentication mechanism established to facilitate secure communication between parties A and B, through a trusted server S. The protocol ensures the authentication of A to B and employs a trusted server to retrieve the public key of A, ensuring the integrity and authenticity of the communication. \n\n**Roles**:\n- **A**: Initiator, who wishes to authenticate to B.\n- **B**: The responder, who verifies the identity of A.\n- **S**: Trusted server, who provides B with the public key of A signed with S's private key.\n\n**Messages**:\n1. **A \u2192 B**: A sends its identity to B.\n2. **B \u2192 A**: B challenges A with a nonce N.\n3. **A \u2192 B**: A responds with the nonce N signed with its private key.\n4. **B \u2192 S**: B requests A's public key from the server, sending A's identity.\n5. **S \u2192 B**: S responds with A's identity and A's public key, signed with S's private key.\n\n**Security Goals**:\n- Ensure that B can confirm that A is the originator of the message and has access to A's private key.\n- Ensure that communications are not replayed or modified by an adversary.\n- Demand proofs for mutual authentication using an event-based approach in the proverif model with event traces.\n\n### ProVerif Script Components\n\n1. **Free Names**: \n   - `c`: A communication channel, considered insecure.\n\n2. **Cryptographic Primitives**:\n   - `pk/1`: A function to derive a public key from a private key.\n   - `sign/2`: A function representing digital signatures.\n   - Reduction rules:\n     - `getmess`: Extracts the message from a signature.\n     - `checksign`: Verifies a signature against a public key returning the signed message.\n\n3. **Host Identification**:\n   - `host/1`: Associates a host with a public key.\n   - Reduction rule:\n     - `getkey`: Determines the private key corresponding to a host identity.\n\n4. **Secrecy Assumptions**:\n   - The private keys `skA`, `skB`, `skS` are not known to the adversary, maintaining confidentiality.\n\n5. **Events**:\n   - `beginBparam(x)`: B starts the protocol expecting to communicate with a host identified by `x`.\n   - `endBparam(x)`: B completes the protocol with the host `x`.\n   - `beginBfull(x,y,z)`: Initiates a full authentication session with parameters.\n   - `endBfull(x,y,z)`: Completes the full session verifying all parameters.\n\n6. **Processes**:\n   - `processA`: Initiates the protocol with B.\n   - `processB`: Executes the verifier role and interacts with S to verify credentials.\n   - `processS`: Acts as a server to supply signed public key credentials to B.\n\n7. **Queries**:\n   - **Authentication Queries**: Verify that the end events imply the beginning events, ensuring successful authentication.\n     - `evinj:endBparam(x) ==> evinj:beginBparam(x)`\n     - `evinj:endBfull(x,y,z) ==> evinj:beginBfull(x,y,z)`\n\n8. **Implementation**:\n   - The processes for A, B, and S are modeled to interact over the channel `c`.\n   - Generates new secrets: private keys `skA`, `skB`, `skS`.\n   - Public keys are derived from the private keys and are associated with host identities.\n\n### Recreating the Pi File\n\nUnderstanding these components and their interactions allows the protocol to be accurately modeled and examined for security properties using ProVerif.

They communicate via channels `cout` and `cin` with the RDP.\n\n2. **RDP (Request Distribution Point)**: The RDP checks and forwards operations. It acts as an intermediary between the client and the organizational service (Org) via channels `orgin` and `orgout`.\n\n3. **Organization (Org)**: This entity provides policy information regarding the authorization of operations and communicates with RDP.\n\n4. **Affiliate**: Processes operations forwarded by RDP and may leak information on public channels.\n\n#### Channels\n- `cout`, `cin`: Channel for client-RDP communication.\n- `orgin`, `orgout`: Channel for RDP-Org communication.\n- `affin`, `affout`: Channel for RDP-Affiliate communication.\n- `pub`: Public channel for any potential information leaks.\n\n#### Types and Messages\n- **Type `Name`**: Represents names that can either be valid or invalid.\n- **Messages**:\n  - `(clientname, op, nonce)`: A tuple containing the client's name, operation, and session nonce sent from client to RDP.\n  - `(okName, okOp, nonce)`: A policy tuple from Org to RDP confirming a client's permissions.\n  - `(orgName, op, nonce)`: A tuple from RDP to affiliate for operation authorization.\n\n#### Security Goals\n\n1. **Privacy of Client Names**: Ensure the affiliate does not learn the client's `Name` regardless of its validity. This is represented by:\n   ```proverif\n   query attacker(validName).\n   query attacker(invalidName).\n   ```\n\n2. **Integrity and Acknowledgement**: Any response received by a client should imply that Org has processed the request and that the process chain RDP \u2192 Org \u2192 Affiliate was successful:\n   ```proverif\n   query nonce:bitstring; event(clientReceiveResponse(nonce)) ==> inj-event(orgOK(nonce)).\n   query nonce:bitstring;\n     event(clientReceiveResponse(nonce))\n     ==>\n     inj-event(rdpWasSuccessful(nonce))\n     &&\n     inj-event(orgOK(nonce))\n     &&\n     inj-event(affReceivesMsg(nonce)).\n   ```\n\n3. **Liveness**: Ensure that whenever the client sends a request, it will eventually receive a response:\n   ```proverif\n   query nonce:bitstring; event(clientReceiveResponse(nonce)) ==> inj-event(clientSendName(nonce)).\n   ```\n\n#### Protocol Execution\n\n1. **Client Process**: Sends a request with a session nonce to RDP, waits for a validated response to complete the transaction.\n\n2. **RDP Process**: Forwards the client's request to Org and upon a valid policy response, sends the operation to the Affiliate and waits for an acknowledgment before returning to the client.\n\n3. **Organization Process**: Verifies if the client is authorized for the requested operation, responds with policy details to RDP.\n\n4. **Affiliate Process**: Accepts requests after RDP's forwarding, provides an acknowledgment, and posts client names publicly.\n\n###  Process Model\n\nThe process model can be replicated using ProVerif's process syntax (as defined in the provided code) to simulate multiple instances of these entities, demonstrating how they interact concurrently to achieve the protocol's design objectives. \n\nThis description can be used to reconstruct or understand the workings and security properties of the protocol from the ProVerif code snippet provided."]]}, "PV-1/signedDH.pv": {"code": [[true, "(* From Proverif git examples directory *)\n\n(* Signed Diffie-Hellman Protocol\n   A -> B : { e^n0 }skA, pkA    (n0 fresh)\n   B -> A : { e^n1 }skB         (n1 fresh)\n   A and B compute the key as k = (e^n0)^n1 = (e^n1)^n0\n   A -> B : { s }k\n*)\n\n(* Communication channel *)\nfree c: channel.\n\n(* Types for public and secret keys, group elements, and exponents *)\ntype pkey.\ntype skey.\ntype G.\ntype exponent.\n\n(* Digital signatures *)\n(* Function to sign a group element with a secret key *)\nfun sign(G, skey): bitstring.\n(* Function to derive a public key from a secret key *)\nfun pk(skey):pkey.\n(* Reduction rules for signatures *)\nreduc forall m: G, k: skey; getmess(sign(m,k)) = m.\nreduc forall m: G, k: skey; checksign(sign(m,k), pk(k)) = m.\n\n(* Shared key encryption *)\n(* Function to encrypt a bitstring with a group element *)\nfun enc(bitstring, G): bitstring.\n(* Reduction rule to decrypt an encrypted message using the key *)\nreduc forall x: bitstring, y: G; dec(enc(x,y),y) = x.\n\n(* Diffie-Hellman key exchange *)\n(* Constant representing the group generator *)\nconst g: G.\n(* Exponential function over the group *)\nfun exp(G, exponent): G.\n(* Equation stating that exponentiation is commutative over the group *)\nequation forall x: exponent, y: exponent; exp(exp(g, x), y) = exp(exp(g, y), x).\n\n(* Test whether the secret s is protected from the attacker *)\nfree s: bitstring [private].\nquery attacker(s).\n\n(* The main process definitions *)\n\n(* Process for participant A *)\nlet p0(skA: skey, pkA: pkey, pkB: pkey) = \n         in(c, pkX: pkey); (* Receive public key pkX from channel *)\n\t new n0: exponent;  (* Generate fresh exponent n0 *)\n         out(c,(sign(exp(g, n0), skA), pkA)); (* Send signed exponentiated group element and public key pkA *)\n\t in(c,m1: bitstring); (* Receive signed message from B *)\n\t let x1 = checksign(m1, pkX) in (* Verify signature on received message *)\n\t let k = exp(x1, n0) in (* Compute shared key k *)\n  \t if pkX = pkB then  (* Check if pkX is indeed B's public key *)\n\t out(c, enc(s,k)).

Here's the corresponding description:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Description: Signed Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange\n\n**Purpose:**\nThe protocol aims to securely exchange a cryptographic key between two parties, A and B, over an insecure channel, using signatures to ensure authenticity. It leverages the classic Diffie-Hellman key exchange, supplemented with digital signatures for authentication.\n\n**Entities:**\n- **A**: An initiator with a private signing key `skA` and corresponding public key `pkA`.\n- **B**: A responder with a private signing key `skB` and corresponding public key `pkB`.\n\n**Types and Functions:**\n- `pkey`: A type representing public keys.\n- `skey`: A type representing private keys.\n- `G`: A group element useful for Diffie-Hellman parameters.\n- `exponent`: A type representing exponents used in the key computations.\n- `sign`: A function that takes a group element and a signing key to produce a signed message as a bitstring.\n- `pk`: A function to derive a public key from a private key.\n- `enc`, `dec`: Functions for symmetric encryption and decryption using a shared secret represented as a group element.\n- `exp`: A function representing exponentiation in the group, used to derive shared secrets.\n- `getmess`, `checksign`: Functions related to retrieving and verifying messages from digital signatures.\n\n**Protocol Steps:**\n\n1. **Initialization:**\n   - Each party, A and B, initializes with their respective private and public signing keys. They exchange their public keys over an insecure channel.\n\n2. **Key Exchange:**\n   - **A to B**: A generates a fresh exponent `n0` and computes the Diffie-Hellman term `e^n0`. A signs this term with `skA` and sends it to B along with `pkA`.\n   - **B to A**: B verifies A's signature, then generates a fresh exponent `n1` and computes `e^n1`. B signs this term with `skB` and sends it back to A.\n\n3. **Key Derivation and Use:**\n   - Both A and B compute the shared secret key `k` using the received exponentials, such that `k = (e^n0)^n1 = (e^n1)^n0`.\n   - **A to B**: A encrypts a secret message `s` with the derived key `k` and sends it to B.\n   - **B**: Upon receiving, B decrypts the message using `k` to retrieve `s`.\n\n**Assumptions:**\n- The channel is insecure, thus messages are susceptible to interception by attackers.\n- The private keys `skA` and `skB` are never disclosed to unauthorized parties.\n- The exponents `n0`, `n1` are freshly generated for each session.\n\n**Security Properties:**\n- The secrecy of `s` is tested against potential attackers.\n- Authentication of messages is assured by the digital signature mechanism.\n  \n**ProVerif Query:**\n- The query `query attacker(s).` checks if an attacker can compromise the secrecy of `s`.\n\n---\n\nThis description aligns with the ProVerif code to guide you in understanding the protocol steps, entities, and security properties, enabling you to reconstruct the ProVerif model file if needed."]]}, "PV-1/WooLamSK.pv": {"code": [[true, "(*************************************************************\n *                                                           *\n *  Cryptographic protocol verifier                          *\n *                                                           *\n *  Bruno Blanchet, Vincent Cheval, and Marc Sylvestre       *\n *                                                           *\n *  Copyright (C) INRIA, CNRS 2000-2023                      *\n *                                                           *\n *************************************************************)\n\n(*\n\n    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify\n    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by\n    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or\n    (at your option) any later version.\n\n    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,\n    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of\n    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

This updated code should still be executable by ProVerif."]], "logic": [[true, "The provided ProVerif code simulates the Woo-Lam shared-key authentication protocol. Here is a detailed description of the protocol, derived from the code, that can be used to reproduce the ProVerif file:\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Name:** Woo-Lam Shared-Key Authentication Protocol (1997)\n\n**Purpose:** To authenticate entities A and B using a shared key known by a trusted server S.\n\n### Entities Involved:\n- **A, B:** Honest hosts participating in the authentication.\n- **S:** Trusted server responsible for verification and distribution of shared keys.\n\n### Data Types:\n- **host:** Represents an entity such as A, B, or S.\n- **nonce:** A unique number used once per session to ensure freshness of the session.\n- **key:** Secret shared key between entities and the server.\n\n### Cryptographic Primitives:\n- **Encryption:** `encrypt(m, k)` where `m` is a message and `k` is a shared key.\n- **Decryption:** `decrypt(c, k)` where `c` is an encrypted message, and `k` is the shared key used to retrieve the original message `m`.\n\n### Protocol Messages:\n1. **A to B:** `A` sends its identity to `B`.\n2. **B to A:** `B` responds with a fresh nonce `N`.\n3. **A to B:** `A` sends `B` an encrypted message `{A, B, N}_kAS`, where `kAS` is the shared key between `A` and the server `S`.\n4. **B to S:** `B` forwards the received encrypted message to `S`, further encrypted as `{A, B, {A, B, N}_kAS}_kBS` where `kBS` is the shared key between `B` and `S`.\n5. **S to B:** `S` decrypts the message to verify and sends back `{A, B, N}_kBS` to `B`.\n\n### Protocol Logic:\n- The initiator (A) and responder (B) are invoked with their identities and shared keys.\n- The server (S) is responsible for validating messages and responding with appropriate verifications.\n\n### Security Assumptions:\n- The keys `Kas` and `Kbs` shared with the server are confidential and not known to the attacker.\n- The attacker can initiate sessions by mimicking an honest participant within the constraints of known entities and their shared keys.\n\n### Process Descriptions:\n1. **Initiator (processInitiator):**\n   - Chooses identity `xA` and intended recipient `xB2`.\n   - Begins protocol `param` event with `xA` and `xB2`.\n   - Sends its identity and receives a nonce `n` from `xB2`.\n   - Begins full protocol event and sends the encrypted message to `xB2`.\n\n2. **Responder (processResponder):**\n   - Chooses identity `xB` and verifies legitimacy.\n   - Receives initiator's identity `xA2`.\n   - Generates a fresh nonce `N` and sends it back.\n   - Receives and forwards an encrypted message to the server `S`.\n\n3. **Server (processS):**\n   - Decrypts and verifies the sequence of received messages.\n   - Responds back to the responder with an encrypted and verified message.\n\n4. **Key Registration (processK):**\n   - Registers any newly introduced hosts and keys, ensuring they don't overwrite existing honest hosts.\n\n### Security Queries:\n- The protocol checks the correctness of executed events by ensuring:\n  - An `end` event is always preceded by a `begin` event for both parameters (`endBparam`) and full sessions (`endBfull`).\n\n### Execution:\n- The processes for initiator, responder, server, and key registration run concurrently and indefinitely to simulate multiple session executions.\n\n### Expected Outcomes:\n- Proven security that ensures the causal relationship between events (`endBparam` implies `beginBparam` and `endBfull` implies `beginBfull`).\n\nThis description allows understanding the protocol well enough to create the corresponding ProVerif file with defined processes, types, and queries."]]}}
