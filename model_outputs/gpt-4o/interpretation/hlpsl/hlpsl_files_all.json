This description will guide you in understanding the roles, message flows, and security goals, thereby allowing you to reconstruct this in HLPSL format:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Objective**: The protocol aims to establish a secure communication and authentication mechanism between three parties: two On-Board Units (OBUs) and a Service Node (SN). The protocol incorporates challenges and hashed responses for mutual authentication and key exchange, leveraging a combination of public/private key cryptographic operations and hash functions.\n\n#### Roles Involved\n\n1. **role_OBU1 (On-Board Unit 1)**:\n   - **Participants**: OBU1, OBU2, SN\n   - **Local variables**: State, A1, C1, H12, S, Q1, Q2, Q2en, Key, R1, MAC, H21\n   - **Actions**:\n     - Initiates a session upon receiving a `start` signal.\n     - Generates a random nonce `A1` and computes `Q1 = exp(P, A1)`.\n     - Sends the message (PID1, PID2, Q1, MAC) to OBU2, where `MAC` is a hash of concatenated PIDs and `Q1`.\n     - Upon receiving a message from OBU2, validates it using `H21` hash, computes a response hash (`H12`), and sends it back.\n     - Marks confidentiality of `A1` and `R1`, ensures authentication via `H12` and `H21`.\n\n2. **role_OBU2 (On-Board Unit 2)**:\n   - **Participants**: OBU1, OBU2, SN\n   - **Local variables**: State, C1, C2, PID1, A2, H12, S, Q1, Q2, R1, R2, S1, R2en, Key, Hs2, H21\n   - **Actions**:\n     - Receives initial message including PIDs, challenges, and a hash (`Hs2`) from SN.\n     - Validates the hash and derives R2' from PUF2.\n     - Computes R1' using XOR with R2en', then generates a new random A2 and Q2.\n     - Sends (C1, Q2, H21) to OBU1.\n     - Upon receipt of `H12`, performs validation and confirms secrecy of shared data (`R1`, `R2`, `A2`) and requests authentication.\n\n3. **role_SN (Service Node)**:\n   - **Participants**: OBU1, OBU2, SN\n   - **Local variables**: State, PID1n, PID2n, Q1, R1, R2, R2en, MAC, Hs2\n   - **Actions**:\n     - Receives initial MAC from OBU1 and validates it to ensure message integrity.\n     - Computes responses using PUF functions (`PUF1`, `PUF2`) to derive R1 and R2, encrypts R2 with R1 using XOR.\n     - Sends back the prepared data to OBU2 for further processing.\n     - Witnesses and authenticates the hashes exchanged between involved parties, ensuring non-repudiation.\n\n#### Protocol Execution\n\nThe protocol is composed of the roles `role_OBU1`, `role_OBU2`, and `role_SN`. Execution begins when an instance of these roles is instantiated by the Environment role.\n\n#### Environmental Settings\n\nThe protocol is set up with:\n- Agents (`obu1`, `obu2`, `sn`) known to be part of the protocol.\n- Static data (`pid1`, `pid2`, `c1`, `c2`, `p`, `h`, `puf1`, `puf2`) and their participation in mutual interactions.\n- The intruder is aware of some public data.\n\n#### Security Goals\n\nThe security goals of the protocol include:\n- **Secrecy**: Protect sensitive data such as `r1`, `r2`, `a1`, and `a2`.\n- **Authentication**: Ensure the authenticity of data using hash-based authentication indicators (`o1_o2_h12`, `s_o2_hs2`).\n\nThis description outlines the interactive participation among roles to establish a secure communication channel while ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of exchanged data. It describes the security measures in place like nonces, hash functions, XOR operations, and public key cryptography to achieve these stated goals."]]}, "HLPSL-1/TLS.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%% YAZAR: MEHMET EM\u0130N KONUK\n%% PROTOKOL: TLS: Transport Layer Security (Ta\u015f\u0131ma Katman\u0131 G\u00fcvenli\u011fi)\n%% **Bu spesifikasyon TLS protokol\u00fcn\u00fcn AVISPA i\u00e7in k\u0131salt\u0131lm\u0131\u015f bir versiyonudur**\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n\nrole alice(A, B : agent,  \n\t   H, PRF, KeyGen: hash_func,\n\t   Ka, Ks: public_key,  %% Ks a\u00e7\u0131k anahtar\n\t   SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n\n   % Local variables declaration\n   local Na, Sid, Pa, PMS: text, %% Na: Nonce from Alice, Sid: Session ID\n         Nb: text,               %% Nb: Nonce from Bob\n         State: nat,             %% State: Keeps track of protocol state\n         Finished: hash(hash(text.text.text).agent.agent.text.text.text),\n         ClientK, ServerK: hash(agent.text.text.hash(text.text.text)), %% Client and Server keys\n         Kb: public_key,         %% Kb: Bob's public key\n         M: hash(text.text.text)\n\n   const sec_clientk, sec_serverk : protocol_id\n\n   init  State := 0  %% Initial state\n\n   transition\n\n   % Transition 1: Start of protocol when Alice receives 'start' message\n   1.

Below is a detailed description of this protocol based on the HLPSL file:\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Name**: Transport Layer Security (TLS)\n\n**Short Description**: This specification presents a simplified version of the TLS protocol for the AVISPA tool, capturing its essential security properties while abstracting some details for brevity.\n\n**Roles**:\n1. **Alice**:\n   - **Participants**:\n     - A: Alice (the client)\n     - B: Bob (the server)\n   - **Channels**: \n     - SND (Send Channel)\n     - RCV (Receive Channel)\n     - Both channels are of type `dy` indicating a Dolev-Yao model where the intruder has full control over the network.\n   - **Local Variables**:\n     - `Na`, `Nb`: Nonces for freshness and session uniqueness.\n     - `Sid`: Session identifier.\n     - `Pa`, `PMS`: Randomly chosen text and Pre-Master Secret.\n     - `Finished`, `ClientK`, `ServerK`: Hashes for verification and session keys.\n     - `Kb`: Public key of Bob.\n   - **Protocol Steps**:\n     1. Alice initiates the protocol by generating a nonce `Na`, a session id `Sid`, and a random value `Pa`. She then sends these to Bob.\n     2. Upon receiving Bob's reply (which includes `Nb`, `Sid`, `Pa`, and Bob's public key encrypted with server's private key), Alice generates a Pre-Master Secret `PMS`, computes the session keys using a pseudo-random function (PRF), and sends several encrypted messages to Bob, including the `PMS`, her certificate, a hash of the handshake messages, and a witness to validate nonces exchange.\n     3. Finally, Alice waits for Bob's Finished message to complete the handshake and confirm Server authentication.\n\n2. **Bob**:\n   - **Participants**:\n     - A: Alice (the client)\n     - B: Bob (the server)\n   - **Channels**: \n     - SND (Send Channel)\n     - RCV (Receive Channel)\n   - **Local Variables**:\n     - `Na`, `Nb`: Nonces exchanged with Alice.\n     - `Sid`: Session identifier.\n     - `Pa`, `PMS`: Received/Generated values from Alice including Pre-Master Secret.\n     - `Ka`: Public key of Alice.\n   - **Protocol Steps**:\n     1. Bob waits for Alice\u2019s initial message containing her nonce, session id, and random value. Bob responds with his own nonce `Nb`, encrypted with server's private key, and acknowledging receipt.\n     2. Upon receiving Alice's reply with the Pre-Master Secret and other integrity checks (hashed and signed), Bob calculates session keys and emits a Finished message encapsulating handshake verification data.\n\n**Session Role**:\n- Combines `alice` and `bob` roles to establish a TLS session between a client (A) and a server (B). This session role models the communication using separate channels for Alice and Bob.\n\n**Environment Role**:\n- Defines the protocol\u2019s initial environment including constants, public keys, agents, and what the intruder knows initially. It also specifies multiple sessions to be conducted including potential interactions with an intruder agent `i`.\n\n**Goals**:\n1. **Secrecy Goals**: Ensure the confidentiality of `sec_clientk` and `sec_serverk`, which relate to the client and server's symmetric session keys.\n2. **Authentication Goals**: \n   - `authentication_on na_nb1`: Alice authenticates Bob using the nonce exchange as evidence.\n   - `authentication_on na_nb2`: Bob authenticates Alice using the nonce exchange as evidence.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides a holistic understanding of the protocol as encoded in HLPSL, emphasizing the control and data flow between the interacting roles, security objectives, and the model's encompassment within the defined environment for the AVISPA tool.

Below is an outline of how the protocol operates:\n\n#### Roles and Participants\n\n1. **role_A**:\n   - Played by agent `A`.\n   - Exchanges cryptographic values with `role_B`.\n   - Aims to exchange a secret securely.\n\n2. **role_B**:\n   - Played by agent `B`.\n   - Engages with `role_A` to establish a shared secret.\n   - Ensures the confidentiality of the information exchanged.\n\n#### Protocol Steps\n\n1. **Initialization**: \n   - Both roles begin their state at `0`.\n\n2. **Step 1** (Executed by `role_A`):\n   - In state `0`, upon receiving the `start` signal, `role_A` generates a new private value `X` and sends the exponentiation `exp(G,X)` to `role_B`. This is transmitted over a Dolev-Yao (DY) insecure channel, denoted as `SND`.\n   - The state transitions to `1`.\n\n3. **Step 2** (Executed by `role_B`):\n   - In state `0`, upon receiving `exp(G,X)` from `role_A`, `role_B` generates its own private value `Y` and sends `exp(G,Y)` back to `role_A`.\n   - The state transitions to `1` for `role_B`.\n\n4. **Step 3** (Back to `role_A`):\n   - In state `1`, `role_A` receives `exp(G,Y)` from `role_B`.\n   - `role_A` generates a new secret, `N`, and uses the expression `exp(exp(G,X),Y)` to encrypt `N`. The resulting message `{N}_exp(exp(G,X),Y')` is sent to `role_B`.\n   - This action ensures that `N` is only accessible to `role_B`.\n   - The state shifts to `2` for `role_A`.\n\n5. **Step 4** (Final step for `role_B`):\n   - In its state `1`, upon receiving `{N}_exp(exp(G,X),Y)`, `role_B` can recover `N`, ensuring its secrecy is maintained.\n   - The state transitions to `2`.\n\n#### Environment and Security Goals\n\n- The environment is initialized with two agents, `a` and `b`, with a shared text `f`. These agents correspond to `A` and `B` in `role_A` and `role_B`.\n- The protocol aims to achieve two main secrecy goals:\n  - **Secrecy of `sec_1`**: Ensures that the secret `N` shared between `role_A` and `role_B` remains confidential to both agents.\n  - **Secrecy of `sec_2`**: There is a declaration for this goal in the environment; however, it isn't explicitly referenced or utilized within the provided roles, indicating a potential placeholder or extension for future use.\n\n#### Intruder Model\n\n- The intruder, as per Dolev-Yao assumptions, has full access to the insecure communication channels and initially knows `a`, `b`, and `f`.\n- The intruder attempts to compromise the secrecy of exchanges but should be thwarted by the protocol's design, achieving the defined security goals.\n\nWith this description, anyone familiar with HLPSL and AVISPA can construct a corresponding file for verification purposes."]]}, "HLPSL-1/calp-v1.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: CALP:Control Access Loria Protocol\n%% PURPOSE: A Server (S) and a Badge Reader (B)\n%% Two scenarios: - A normal access request (1)\n%%                - An exceptional access request (2)\n%%B -> S : {IdBadgeuse, IdEmploye}_PKs\n%%S -> B : { Ok }_PKb\n%%B -> S : { Ok }_PKs\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%% Definition of the role for Badge Reader, initiating the protocol\nrole badgeuse (B, S: agent,\n\t    IdEmploye, IdBadgeuse : protocol_id,             \n            PKb, PKs: public_key,      \n            SND, RCV: channel(dy)) \n\nplayed_by B def=\n\n  local State: nat %% Represents the current state of the Badge Reader\n\n  init State:=0 %% Initial state is 0\n  \n  transition  \n   \n    0.

This protocol involves two main parties: a server (S) and a badge reader (B). The protocol aims to handle two primary scenarios: a standard access request and an exceptional access request. Below, I will describe the roles and the sequence of interactions as interpreted from the HLPSL script.\n\n### Protocol Description: CALP\n\n**Entities Involved:**\n1. **Server (S):** Acts as the verifier and responder to access requests.\n2. **Badge Reader (B):** Initiates the protocol by requesting access on behalf of an employee.\n\n**Identifiers:**\n- **IdBadgeuse:** Identifier for the badge reader.\n- **IdEmploye:** Identifier for the employee requesting access.\n\n**Keys:**\n- **PKb:** Public key of the badge reader.\n- **PKs:** Public key of the server.\n\n**Protocol Messages:**\n1. **B -> S:** `{IdBadgeuse, IdEmploye}_PKs`\n   - The badge reader sends a message to the server containing its own identifier and the employee's identifier, encrypted with the server\u2019s public key.\n2. **S -> B:** `{Ok}_PKb`\n   - Upon validation, the server replies to the badge reader with an acknowledgment \"Ok\" message encrypted with the badge reader's public key.\n3. **B -> S:** `{Ok}_PKs`\n   - The badge reader further confirms the reception of the server\u2019s message by sending an \"Ok\" message back to the server, encrypted with the server's public key.\n\n### Roles\n\n1. **Badge Reader (role badgeuse):**\n   - Initiated by the badge reader entity (B).\n   - It starts the protocol by sending an encrypted request with `IdEmploye` and `IdBadgeuse` to the server.\n   - Waits to receive an acknowledgment `{Ok}_PKb` from the server.\n   - Upon receiving \"Ok\", responds back with an encrypted \"Ok\" to the server to complete the session.\n\n2. **Server (role serveur):**\n   - Played by the server entity (S).\n   - Upon receiving a request from the badge reader, decrypts it and checks the identifiers for validity.\n   - If successful, sends back an acknowledgment `{Ok}_PKb` to the badge reader.\n\n3. **Session Role (role session):**\n   - Defines a particular interaction session between a badge reader and the server. \n   - Ensures communication occurs between the authenticated entities using the established roles.\n\n4. **Environment Role (role environment):**\n   - Simulates the protocol execution scenario.\n   - Defines the knowledge available to the intruder comprising public keys and agents involved.\n   - Initiates multiple sessions, including the legitimate session and a session involving interactions with an intruder (represented by 'i') to test protocol robustness.\n\n### Security Goals\n\n- **Secrecy of `IdEmploye`:** Ensures the privacy of `IdEmploye` so that an intruder cannot gain access to this identifier during communications.\n\n### Intruder Assumptions\n- The intruder is assumed to know public keys (including an assumed intruder's key and its inverse) and access to the public network channels.\n\nThis description provides a complete overview of the protocol as depicted in the HLPSL code.

Below is the description content of the protocol based on this file:\n\n---\n\n**Protocol Name:**  \nEKE: Encrypted Key Exchange\n\n**Purpose:**  \nThe primary aim of the EKE protocol is to securely exchange a symmetric key between two parties over a potentially insecure channel.\n\n**Overview:**  \nThe protocol involves two agents, typically named Alice (A) and Bob (B), who wish to exchange a symmetric key, denoted as Kab. The protocol achieves this by encrypting key exchange messages using encryption schemes that protect against eavesdroppers.\n\n**Roles:**  \n1. **Initiator (eke_Init):**  \n   - Played by Alice (A)\n   - Responsible for initiating the key exchange by sending an encrypted message containing a new public key (Ea) to Bob (B).\n   - Awaits a response from Bob, containing an encrypted symmetric key (K), then issues a nonce (Na) to further authenticate the session.\n   \n2. **Responder (eke_Resp):**  \n   - Played by Bob (B)\n   - Awaits the initial encrypted message from Alice, decrypts it, and responds with a new symmetric key (K) encrypted with Alice's public key.\n   - Validates Alice's nonce (Na) and issues a challenge response using a second nonce (Nb).\n\n**HLPSL Role Descriptions:**\n\n- **eke_Init Role:**  \n  Alice starts by creating a new public key, which she encrypts with the symmetric key Kab and transmits to Bob. After receiving the encrypted symmetric key from Bob, Alice generates a nonce Na and sends it, encrypted with the received symmetric key, to Bob as a challenge for authentication.\n\n- **eke_Resp Role:**  \n  Bob, upon receiving Alice's encrypted message, generates a symmetric key (K) and sends it encrypted with Alice's public key. Upon receipt of Alice's nonce (Na), Bob generates a nonce (Nb) and sends both nonces back to Alice, encrypted with the symmetric key, to complete the authentication.\n\n**Confidentiality and Authentication Goals:**\n\n- **Confidentiality (Secrecy of sec_k1, sec_k2):**  \n  The protocol aims to maintain the secrecy of the symmetric keys used in the encrypted communication between Alice and Bob.\n\n- **Authentication (G2):**  \n  Ensuring that Alice can authenticate the response from Bob regarding nonce Nb, and Bob can authenticate Alice's nonce Na.\n\n**Potential Vulnerabilities:**\n\n- Describes a parallel session attack and man-in-the-middle scenario, wherein an intruder may passively intercept and relay messages without exposing secret nonces.\n\n**Limitations and Problems:**  \nThe file notes a limitation of none but mentions problems categorized under classifications G2 (authentication) and G12 (confidentiality).\n\n**References:**  \nThe protocol is based on work described by Bellovin and Merritt (1992) and further models by Siemens and ETH Z\u00fcrich contributors.\n\n**Modelers:**  \n- Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003  \n- Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z\u00fcrich, December 2003\n\n**Implementation Context:**  \nThe protocol is implemented in the HLPSL language for formal analysis using the Avispa tool, detailing roles, their composition, and the intruder model.\n\n---\n\nThis description provides the necessary context for reconstructing the HLPSL file from scratch based on the protocol description, outlining the roles, transitions, and security goals associated with the Encrypted Key Exchange protocol."]]}, "HLPSL-1/h.530.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: H.530: Symmetric security procedures for H.323 mobility in H.510\n%% VARIANT: Original version\n%% PURPOSE: Establish an authenticated (Diffie-Hellman) shared-key\n%% between a mobile terminal (MT) and a visited gate-keeper (VGK), who do not\n%% know each other in advance, but who have a \"mutual friend\", an\n%% authentication facility (AuF) in the home domain of MT.\n%%\n%% REFERENCE: \\url{http://www.itu.int/rec/recommendation.asp?type=folders&lang=e&parent=T-REC-H.530} \\\\\n%% (original version without \"corrigendum\")\n%% MODELER: Sebastian M\\\"odersheim, ETH Z\\\"urich, 2004\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% See original content for message exchanges.\n%%\n%% PROBLEMS: 3\n%% DESCRIBES: A replay attack due to insufficient information conveyed in messages.\n%%\n%% NOTES:\n%% - The fixed version is not vulnerable to these attacks.\n%% - Intermediate hops between VGK and AuF are omitted for simplicity.\n\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\n%%  HLPSL: Definition of the protocol roles\n\nrole mobileTerminal (\n    MT,VGK,AuF : agent,              %% Specify roles in the protocol\n    SND,RCV    : channel(dy),        %% Channels used for message sending and receiving\n    F          : hash_func,          %% Hash function used for hashing\n    ZZ         : symmetric_key,      %% Symmetric key shared with AuF\n    NIL,G      : text)               %% Constants, NIL being a placeholder\nplayed_by MT def=\n\n  local\n    State       : nat,\n    X,CH1,CH3   : text,              %% Nonces and ephemeral values\n    CH2,CH4     : text,\n    GY,Key      : message            %% Public Diffie-Hellman parameters and the resulting key\n\n  const sec_m_Key : protocol_id      %% Security policy constant\n\n  init  \n    State := 0                        %% Protocol starts at state 0\n\n  transition\n\n 1.

This protocol is integral within H.323 mobile environments, where both entities do not share previous knowledge of each other but have a mutual entity named an Authentication Facility (AuF) within MT's home domain. Using Diffie-Hellman exchange, the protocol ensures secure and authenticated communication between MT and VGK.\n\n**Roles:**\n\n1. **Mobile Terminal (MT):** \n   - Initiates the protocol to establish a secure session with the VGK.\n   - Utilizes Diffie-Hellman to generate a session key in cooperation with VGK, routed via AuF.\n   - Verifies the integrity and authenticity of messages received from VGK.\n\n2. **Visited Gatekeeper (VGK):** \n   - Establishes secure communication with MT and interacts with AuF to authenticate MT.\n   - Collaboratively generates a shared session key with MT.\n   - Engages with AuF to verify MT's legitimacy and establish session continuity.\n\n3. **Authentication Facility (AuF):** \n   - Acts as an intermediary to authenticate MT for VGK using existing pre-shared symmetric keys.\n   - Relays messages between MT and VGK while ensuring both parties' identities are validated.\n\n**Message Flow:**\n\n1. **Message 1:** \n   - MT initiates communication, sending a nonce (CH1) and its temporary Diffie-Hellman public value (exp(G,X)) to VGK, secured with a hash involving its symmetric key ZZ.\n\n2. **Message 2:**\n   - VGK forwards MT's data, alongside its Diffie-Hellman exchange component (exp(G,Y) XOR exp(G,X)), to AuF for authentication, secured using ZZ_VA key.\n\n3. **Message 3:**\n   - AuF responds to VGK with an acknowledgment, relaying a hash-secured message back to VGK.\n\n4. **Message 4:**\n   - VGK sends back its Diffie-Hellman public value and confirmation hashes to MT, finalizing the session key (exp(exp(G,X),Y)) computation.\n\n5. **Message 5 and 6:**\n   - Confirmation and continuation messages (CH3,CH4) exchanged between MT and VGK to finalize the session establishment, ensuring key integrity and session initiation.\n\n**Security Goals:**\n\n- **Entity Authentication:** Ensures MT and VGK identities are verified through mutual exchanges, facilitated by AuF.\n- **Key Authentication:** Ensures the shared session key integrity and confidentiality is upheld throughout the exchange.\n- **Secrecy:** Protects the agreed session key as a secret known only to MT and VGK.\n\n**Potential Issues:**\n- **Replay Attacks:** Limited information in the AuF response can allow an attacker to replay communication sequences, tricking VGK into false authentications.\n- **Message Indistinguishability:** Without differences between specific exchanges (messages 2 and 3), VGK may misinterpret or misvalidate communications, compromising security.\n\n**Implementation Notes:**\n- The role-players in the protocol must strictly follow the sequence and security provisions.\n- Cryptographic functions like hash and symmetric keys (ZZ, ZZ_VA) ensure message integrity and confidentiality.\n- The intruder knowledge includes shared elements but does not compromise secure exchanges due to session-specific random values and Diffie-Hellman principles.\n\n**Model Configuration:**\n- The environment role constructs test scenarios emulating typical communication sessions.\n- Additional configurations enable sessions with modified participants, simulating potential intruder scenarios.\n\nThis descriptive content offers a technical outline of the H.530 protocol, demonstrating a secure mutual authentication method for entities within the H.323 framework. Through complex cryptographic exchanges and facilitated by the AuF, MT and VGK establish a trusted session."]]}, "HLPSL-1/IKEv2-DS.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: IKEv2: Internet Key Exchange, version 2\n%% VARIANT: authentication based on digital signatures\n%% PURPOSE:\n%% IKE is designed to perform mutual authentication and key\n%% exchange prior to setting up an IPsec connection.\n%%\n%% IKEv2 exists in several variants, the defining difference\n%% being the authentication method used.  \n%%\n%% This variant, which we call IKEv2-DS, uses digital signatures.\n%%\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\cite{ipsec-ikev2}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%% \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\item Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% IKEv2-DS proceeds in two so-called exchanges.

Here's a detailed description of the protocol as modeled in the code:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nIKEv2 is designed to perform mutual authentication and establish a shared cryptographic key between two parties, known in this context as Alice (A) and Bob (B), before setting up an IPsec secure connection. The variant analyzed here uses digital signatures for authentication.\n\n### Protocol Phases\n\nThe protocol consists of two main exchanges:\n\n1. **IKE_SA_INIT**:\n   - In this phase, Alice and Bob exchange nonces and perform a Diffie-Hellman key exchange to establish an initial security association, known as IKE_SA.\n\n2. **IKE_SA_AUTH**:\n   - This phase authenticates the first phase messages, exchanges user identities, and establishes the first \"child security association\" (CHILD_SA) which will be used to secure the subsequent IPsec tunnel.\n\n### Exchange Details\n\n- **IKE_SA_INIT**\n  1. Alice generates a nonce (`Na`) and a Diffie-Hellman half-key (`KEa`), then sends a cryptosuite offer (`SAa1`) to Bob.\n  2. Bob responds with his preferred cryptosuite (`SAb1`), his Diffie-Hellman half-key (`KEb`), and his nonce (`Nb`).\n\n- **IKE_SA_AUTH**\n  3. Alice sends her identity, an authentication value (`AUTHa`), and a new cryptosuite offer (`SAa2`), all encrypted with a key derived from the exchanged nonces and Diffie-Hellman values.\n  4. Bob replies with his identity, an authentication value (`AUTHb`), and his preferred cryptosuite (`SAb2`), also encrypted with the previously derived key.\n\n### Modeling Assumptions\n\n- Cryptographic negotiation is abstracted such that Alice\u2019s and Bob\u2019s cryptosuite offers are assumed equal (SAa1 = SAb1 and SAa2 = SAb2).\n- Certain aspects of IKEv2, such as identity hiding and public-key certificate exchanges, are omitted for simplification.\n- The model assumes a network where messages can be intercepted and possibly altered by an intruder.\n\n### Intruder Model and Attack Scenario\n\nThe model includes an intruder capable of performing a man-in-the-middle attack, relaying messages between Alice and Bob without their awareness. The attack illustrated in the protocol trace shows that the intruder could convince Bob that he is communicating directly with Alice, even though Alice and Bob are not participating in the same session.\n\n### Security Goals\n\nThe protocol aims to ensure:\n\n- **Secrecy** of session keys (`sec_a_SK` and `sec_b_SK`).\n- **Authentication**: Alice authenticates Bob on `sk1`, and Bob authenticates Alice on `sk2`.\n\nThese goals are classified under specific security goals addressed by IKEv2, such as mutual authentication and key secrecy. However, the model identifies potential vulnerabilities, such as lacking key confirmation, which could be mitigated by extending the protocol to include additional checks.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe HLPSL model of IKEv2-DS captures the essential mechanisms of mutual authentication and key establishment using digital signatures. It demonstrates how these processes can be vulnerable to certain attacks and highlights areas where the protocol could be strengthened, particularly regarding key confirmation to prevent replay or man-in-the-middle attacks.\n\nThis description provides a comprehensive understanding of the IKEv2-DS protocol as modeled in the provided HLPSL code, detailing the protocol's structure, assumptions, potential vulnerabilities, and security goals."]]}, "HLPSL-1/NSPK_2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%Alice - Bob\n%\n%   1.

Specifically:\n  - `secrecy_of secret_na`: Ensure that Na remains a secret.\n  - `secrecy_of secret_nb`: Ensure that Nb remains a secret.\n\n#### Roles:\n- **Alice (Role)**: Manages the initiation of the protocol, handles her local state transitions, and manages the sending and receiving of her respective messages with proper state updates and nonce generation.\n- **Bob (Role)**: Handles the responses, manages his local state, and ensures that the correct messages are sent after the appropriate transitions, along with nonce generation.\n\n#### Session:\n- **session(A, B, Ka, Kb)**: This encapsulates the interaction between Alice and Bob and defines their roles, including communication channels.\n\n#### Environment:\n- The environment sets up the necessary parameters, including known agents (Alice, Bob, and the potential intruder), their keys, and specifies the protocol's configuration in the presences of an intruder.\n- An intruder-knowledge set is defined to simulate possible actions by an adversary with knowledge of certain keys and identities.\n\n---\n\nThis description should allow you to reconstruct the given HLPSL protocol file.

The intruder initially knows the identities of all agents and can attempt to learn or misuse keys.\n\n**Goals Formalized:**\n- The primary security goal is the authentication on the session key Kab, validated through the protocol ID.\n\nBy following this description, one can construct the corresponding HLPSL file that reflects the same logical structure and message flows specified in the given Woo-Lam protocol."]]}, "HLPSL-1/XorNSPK_1.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "% NSPKxor Protocol\n% This protocol describes a variation of the Needham-Schroeder Public-Key (NSPK) protocol leveraging XOR operations for message handling.\n\n% Message flow:\n%   1.

Here is the detailed description content based on the HLPSL file:\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Name\n**NSPKxor Protocol**\n\n### Protocol Description\nThe NSPKxor protocol is a public-key cryptographic protocol designed for mutual authentication between two parties: Alice (A) and Bob (B). It is a modified version of the traditional Needham-Schroeder Public-Key protocol, incorporating an XOR operation to encrypt parts of the exchanged messages.\n\n### Messages Exchanged\n1. **A -> B**: Alice starts the communication by sending a message encrypted with Bob's public key, containing a nonce `Na` and Alice's identity.\n   - `{Na.A}_Kb`\n\n2. **B -> A**: Upon receiving Alice's message, Bob responds by sending another message encrypted with Alice's public key, containing a new nonce `Nb` and the XORed result of nonce `Na` and Bob's identity.\n   - `{Nb, Na xor B}_Ka`\n\n3. **A -> B**: Finally, Alice sends Bob a message encrypted with Bob's public key, containing the nonce `Nb` that Bob sent in step 2.\n   - `{Nb}_Kb`\n\n### Roles in the Protocol\n\n#### Alice's Role\n- **Initialization**: Alice generates a new nonce `Na` and sets her state to 0.\n- **States**:\n  - **State 0**: Upon receiving the `start` signal, Alice transitions to state 1, creates a new nonce `Na`, and sends `{Na.A}_Kb`.\n  - **State 1**: On receiving `{Nb, Na xor B}_Ka`, she transitions to state 2 and sends back `{Nb}_Kb`.\n\n#### Bob's Role\n- **Initialization**: Bob generates a new nonce `Nb` and sets his state to 0.\n- **States**:\n  - **State 0**: On receiving `{Na.A}_Kb`, Bob transitions to state 1, creates a new nonce `Nb`, and sends `{Nb, Na xor B}_Ka`.\n  - **State 1**: On receiving `{Nb}_Kb`, Bob transitions to state 2.\n\n### Session Role\n- Composes both Alice's and Bob's roles to simulate a complete protocol execution between Alice and Bob, using their respective public keys for encryption and a shared communication channel.\n\n### Environment Role\n- Sets up the protocol environment, including the agents (Alice `a`, Bob `b`, Intruder `i`), their corresponding public keys, and the known intruder knowledge.\n- Simulates two sessions:\n  - A normal session between Alice and Bob.\n  - A session involving an intruder impersonating Bob.\n\n### Security Goals\n- **Secrecy**: The protocol aims to ensure the secrecy of the nonce `Na` exchanged between Alice and Bob, identified by `secret_na`.\n\n### Intruder Model\n- The protocol assumes a Dolev-Yao intruder model, where the intruder `i` has access to the network and can intercept, modify, and fabricate messages. The intruder has knowledge about the identities of Alice, Bob, themselves, and the public keys `ka`, `kb`, and `ki`, as well as the private key `inv(ki)`.\n\n### References\n- The protocol adapts concepts from classic Needham-Schroeder Public-Key protocols, with notable variations.\n\n---\n\nThis detailed description can assist in regenerating or understanding the HLPSL code used for the protocol, outlining each role, state transition, and the security goals intended to be achieved."]]}, "HLPSL-1/strongAuthentication_xor.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%%%% B -> A: B,s\n\nrole role_A(A:agent,B:agent,SND,RCV:channel(dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n\tlocal\n\t\tState:nat,S:text,Na:text\n\tinit\n\t\tState := 0\n\ttransition\n                                1.

Upon receiving a `start` message, A generates a new nonce `Na` and sends it to B using `SND`.\n   - **Step 2**: In `State 1`, A expects to receive a message containing an XOR of its nonce `Na` and a secret `S'`.

Additionally, B registers this action as a `witness` for the authentication of `Na`.\n   - B declares the secret `S` and its conditions using `secret(S, sec_1, {A,B})`.\n\n### Session Composition\n- The protocol session defines interactions between specific participants A and B with a secret `S`. The session composition specifies parallel executions of roles `role_A` and `role_B`.\n\n### Environment\n- **Constants:** `alice` and `bob` represent the agents involved, and `s1` is a secret. Protocol identifiers such as `sec_1`, `sec_2`, and `auth_1` are used to define goals.\n- The `intruder_knowledge` is initialized with knowledge of the participants' identities (i.e., `alice` and `bob`).\n\n### Goals\n- **Secrecy Goals:**\n  - The protocol ensures that `sec_1` and `sec_2` remain confidential throughout the exchanges.\n  \n- **Authentication Goals:**\n  - The protocol aims to provide strong authentication on `auth_1`, ensuring A can confirm B's involvement in generating `Na`.\n\n### Replay Attacks\n- The environment sets up two concurrent sessions of the protocol between the same agents to explore the protocol's resilience to replay attacks.\n\nThis structured description allows for the construction of a corresponding HLPSL file that can be used for simulation and analysis with the AVISPA tool to verify the specified security properties.

Below is a detailed description of the protocol based on the provided HLPSL code. This description can help you regenerate the corresponding HLPSL file to be run by AVISPA.\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nThe protocol is designed to achieve secure registration, log signcryption, and verification between a User, Authority, and Sensor. It involves multiple cryptographic operations, including symmetric encryption, digital signatures, and key agreement.\n\n### Roles\n\n1. **User Role**\n   - **Participants**: A (Authority), S (Sensor), U (User)\n   - **Keys**: Kau (symmetric key), ECDSA (public key)\n   - **Local Variables**: Includes text variables for various parameters such as IDi, TIDi, log signature (X), and others.\n   - **Phases**:\n     - **Registration Phase**: The User sends a request containing a newly generated identity (IDi) encrypted with the symmetric key (Kau) to the Authority.\n     - **Log Verification Phase**: The User receives a cryptographic challenge from the Authority, uses it for log verification, and requests the Sensor's log signature.\n     - **Log Unsigncryption Phase**: The User computes secret values to decrypt and view log data.\n\n2. **Authority Role**\n   - **Participants**: A (Authority), S (Sensor), U (User)\n   - **Keys**: Kau (symmetric key), ECDSA (public key)\n   - **Local Variables**: Similar to the User role, including text variables like IDi, TIDi, and cryptographic parameters.\n   - **Phases**:\n     - **Registration Phase**: Upon receiving an encrypted identity from the User, the Authority generates a session key (SK) combining newly created attributes and sends it back encrypted.\n        \n3. **Sensor Role**\n   - **Participants**: A (Authority), S (Sensor), U (User)\n   - **Keys**: Kau (symmetric key), ECDSA (public key)\n   - **Local Variables**: Variables include unique session identifiers, cryptographic hashes, log data (M), and timestamps (T).\n   - **Phase**:\n     - **Log Signcryption Phase**: The Sensor signs log data using ECDSA, encrypts it, and sends it along with computed values to the User.\n\n### Session and Environment\n\n- **Session Role**: Combines the Authority, Sensor, and User roles, setting up secure communication through dynamic channels.\n  \n- **Environment Role**: Defines the agents involved, cryptographic keys, and intruder knowledge. It allows for testing scenarios with potential dishonest agents.\n\n### Goals\n\n- **Secrecy Goals**: Ensures the secrecy of identifiers and keys like idi, sk, alpha, and ss.\n  \n- **Authentication Goals**: Assures authenticity in the session key exchange.\n\nThe script concludes with assertions to test the secrecy of the generated keys and identifiers as well as authentication for session policies.\n\nThis description captures the procedural constructs of the protocol as laid out in the HLPSL file.

Below are the protocol components and their interactions:\n\n### Protocol Description\n\n**Entities Involved:**\n1. **User (U)**: This actor initiates the protocol, registering and authenticating with the server.\n2. **Server (S)**: The entity that the user registers with and authenticates to.\n3. **Intruder (I)**: As per Dolev-Yao model, the intruder has control over the communication network but is limited by cryptographic constraints.\n4. **Channel**: Assumed to support Dolev-Yao (dy) intrusion model where messages can be intercepted, sent, and overheard by an intruder.\n\n**Key Materials:**\n1. **Kus**: A symmetric key known to both User and Server.\n2. **Chebyshev Polynomial (T)**: Used in calculations for cryptographic purposes.\n3. **Hash Function (H)**: Used to create hash values for password and session keys.\n4. **Protocol Identifiers (g1-g6, u_s_pi, s_u_sj)**: Used to identify secrets and authenticate sessions.\n\n**Local Variables and Notations:**\n- **IDi, SIDj**: Identifiers for the user and the session, respectively.\n- **PWi**: User's password.\n- **Yi, Ai, Aii, Bj, Ui, Uj, Bi, Ci, Bii, Bjj, Ki, Kij, Ri, Pi, Mi, Sj, Wj, MacSj, MacUi, Xsj**: Intermediate variable names used during the protocol for cryptographic operations and message elements.\n- **State**: Represents different stages in the protocol execution.\n\n### Protocol Phases\n\n1. **Registration Phase:**\n   - The User generates a new identifier (`IDi`), session ID (`SIDj`), password (`PWi`), and random value (`Yi`).\n   - The User computes `Ai` using the Chebyshev polynomial operation `T(Yi.X)`.\n   - The User creates `Aii`, a mix of hashes of their password and session ID, both masked by `Ai`.\n   - The User sends an encrypted message to the Server containing their `IDi` and `Aii` using the shared symmetric key `Kus`.\n\n2. **Mutual Authentication Phase:**\n   - The Server receives the encrypted message and computes `Bj` using `T(Xsj.X)`.\n   - The Server generates `Ui` and `Uj`, which are hashed identifiers of User and Session, masked by `Bj`.\n   - The Server sends two masked values `Bii` and `Bjj` back to the User.\n   - The User uses these values to compute several other variables (`Ui`, `Ki`, `Ri`, etc.) and sends a message back to the Server.\n   - Each side generates session keys and performs mutual verification via hashes (`MacUi` and `MacSj`).\n\n3. **Security Goals:**\n   - **Secrecy**: The protocol aims to maintain the secrecy of certain variables like identifiers and session keys (`g1-g6`).\n   - **Authentication**: Ensures mutual authentication between the user and the server (`u_s_pi`, `s_u_sj`).\n\n### Role Descriptions\n\n- **User Role**: Described by actions the user undertakes during registration and authentication, including sending and receiving encrypted messages and verifying secrets.\n- **Server Role**: Described by actions undertaken by the server to verify, authenticate, and establish a session with the user.\n- **Session Role**: Defines the interaction between the User and the Server.\n- **Environment Role**: Models the protocol execution context, including potential sessions initiated by an intruder.\n\nIn summary, this protocol uses a combination of symmetric keys, Chebyshev polynomials, and hash functions to secure user registration and authentication with a server. The protocol mitigates risks by ensuring the secrecy of critical data and mutual authentication through cryptographic operations. An intruder following the Dolev-Yao model cannot break the protocol without the secrets reserved for the legitimate parties."]]}, "HLPSL-1/CHAPv2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: (MS-)CHAPv2\n%% Challenge/Response Authentication Protocol, version 2\n%% PURPOSE:\n%% Mutual authentication between a server and a client who share a password.\n%% CHAPv2 is the authentication protocol for the Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol\n%% suite (PPTP).\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\cite{RFC2759}\n%% MODELER:\n%%\\begin{itemize}\n%%\\item Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n%%\\item Paul Hankes Drielsma, ETH Z\\\"urich\n%%\\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% We assume that the server \\verb!B! and client \\verb!A! share \n%% password \\verb!k(A,B)! in advance.

This protocol aims to achieve mutual authentication between a client and a server by sharing a common password. Below is a structured description of the protocol based on the information in your HLPSL file:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\n- **Name:** MS-CHAPv2 (Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol, version 2)\n- **Purpose:** Mutual authentication between a client and a server, who share a common password.\n- **Application:** This protocol is part of the authentication protocol suite used in Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP).\n\n### Protocol Participants\n\n1. **Client (A):** The user-initiated role intending to authenticate with the server.\n2. **Server (B):** The role that authenticates the client after a challenge has been received.\n\n### Shared Elements\n\n- **Shared Secret (k(A,B)):** This is the password known only to both the server and client.\n- **Nonces (Na, Nb):** Randomly generated numbers used once for challenges (Na for Alice, Nb for Bob).\n\n### Protocol Steps\n\n1. **1st Step: Initiation**  \n   The client \\( A \\) initiates the connection by sending its identifier to the server \\( B \\).\n   - Message: \\( A \\rightarrow B : A \\)\n\n2. **2nd Step: Challenge**  \n   The server generates a nonce \\( Nb \\) and sends it as a challenge to the client.\n   - Message: \\( B \\rightarrow A : Nb \\)\n\n3. **3rd Step: Client Response**  \n   The client responds with its nonce \\( Na \\) and a hash created from the shared password, the nonces, and the identifier.\n   - Message: \\( A \\rightarrow B : Na, H(k(A,B), (Na, Nb, A)) \\)\n\n4. **4th Step: Server Response**  \n   The server responds with a hash constructed from the shared password and the client\u2019s nonce.\n   - Message: \\( B \\rightarrow A : H(k(A,B), Na) \\)\n\n### Security Goals\n\n- **Secrecy:** Ensuring that the shared key (password) remains confidential.\n- **Authentication:** \n  - The server authenticates the client based on the challenge-response mechanism.\n  - The client authenticates the server upon receiving a valid response.\n\n### HLPSL Roles\n\n1. **chap_Init (A - Client Role):** \n   Handles the initialization and response to the server's challenge.\n\n2. **chap_Resp (B - Server Role):**\n   Handles challenge creation and response verification.\n\n3. **session (A, B):** \n   Composition of both roles executed in a single communication session.\n\n### Environment\n\n- Defines known agents, keys, and a hash function.\n- Includes possible interactions between roles and an intruding agent 'i'.\n\n### Formal Goals Specification\n\n- **Secrecy:** Achieved for shared secrets identifying the session keys (`sec_kab1` and `sec_kab2`).\n- **Authentication:** \n  - Authenticity assurance for the nonces exchanged within the protocol (`na` and `nb`).\n\n### Known Issues and Limitations\n\n- Structures such as message lengths are abstracted to focus on the core protocol logic which might include redundancies.\n- The analysis assumes a Dolev-Yao threat model, where the intruder can intercept, modify, and fabricate messages.\n\n### References and Notes\n\n- The protocol follows the standard as per RFC2759.\n- Cryptanalysis had shown vulnerabilities in specific configurations (as per external sources like ~\\cite{schneier99cryptanalysis}).\n- Modeled by Haykal Tej and Paul Hankes Drielsma in 2003.\n\nThis structured narrative effectively captures the design and intention of the CHAPv2 protocol as represented by the HLPSL specification and can serve as a written guide for generating or interpreting the HLPSL file."]]}, "HLPSL-1/DHCP-delayed-auth.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: DHCP-Delayed-Auth\n%% PURPOSE:\n%%    Delayed entity and message authentication for DHCP\n%%\n%% REFERENCE: RFC 3118, \\url{http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3118.html}\n%% MODELER: \n%%   \\begin{itemize}\n%%   \\item Graham Steel, University of Edinburgh, July 2004\n%%   \\item Luca Compagna, AI-Lab DIST University of Genova, November 2004\n%%   \\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%%\\begin{verbatim}\n%%1.

The protocol file is structured with roles and goals that define the purpose, the messages exchanged, and the security properties desired. Below is a detailed description of this protocol:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\n**Name:** DHCP-Delayed-Auth  \n**Purpose:** This protocol provides delayed entity and message authentication for DHCP communications. It ensures that the identity of the involved parties can be verified after messages have been exchanged.\n\n**Reference:** The protocol is based on RFC 3118, which specifies DHCP authentication techniques. Although it aims to secure DHCP communications, this model specifically focuses on the minimum protocol requirements as stipulated in the RFC (the \"MUST\" requirements).\n\n**Modelers:**\n- Graham Steel, University of Edinburgh, July 2004\n- Luca Compagna, AI-Lab DIST University of Genova, November 2004\n\n### Participants and Initial Setup\n\n- **Client (C):** Initiating agent in a DHCP transaction.\n- **Server (S):** Responding agent that provides DHCP services.\n- **H:** The Hash function used for HMAC.\n- **KeyID:** Function mapping a key to its associated identifier.\n- **K:** Pre-shared secret key between the client and server.\n- **Snd, Rcv:** Channels used for message sending and receiving, respectively.\n\n### Protocol Messages\n\n1. **Client to Server:**\n   - Message 1: `C -> S : C, delayedAuthReq, Time1`\n     - The client sends a request for delayed authentication along with a timestamp or nonce `Time1`.\n\n2. **Server to Client:**\n   - Message 2: `S -> C : S, delayedAuthReq, succ(Time1), KeyID(K), H(S, delayedAuthReq, succ(Time1), K)`\n     - The server responds with a message indicating success, an incremented version of the original nonce `succ(Time1)`, a key identifier, and a hash representing the computed HMAC value over the message components.\n\n### Limitations\n\nThis model encapsulates a minimal version of the DHCP delayed authentication process. It doesn't implement optional elements described in the RFC, such as different HMAC algorithms or replay detection mechanisms beyond a simple nonce increment scheme.\n\n### Protocol Roles\n\n#### Client Role: \n\nHandles initiating the authentication request and verifying the server's response. It maintains state that progresses from sending a start message to receiving and validating the server reply.\n\n#### Server Role:\n\nThis role processes incoming authentication requests, crafts appropriate responses, and communicates authentication evidence based on the shared secret.\n\n#### Session Role:\n\nEstablishes a composition of client and server roles, utilizing dedicated communication channels for interaction.\n\n#### Environment Role:\n\nDefines the agents, keys, and other values available within the system scope. The intruder's knowledge is pre-defined to simulate potential attacks or verification processes against protocol security.\n\n### Security Goals\n\n1. **Secrecy of `sec_k`:** Ensures that the pre-existing shared secret remains confidential and is not disclosed to unauthorized parties.\n2. **Authentication on `sig`:** Verifies the legitimacy of the server\u2019s response to confirm the receiver's identity.\n\nThe protocol model in HLPSL captures these goals to evaluate potential vulnerabilities and affirm that the interactions are secure under specified assumptions. Running this model in the AVISPA tool checks these properties and ensures that the DHCP communications with delayed authentication achieve the desired security outcomes without any known attacks compromising the protocol."]]}, "HLPSL-1/Three-factor_fast_authentication_scheme_for_e-health_systems_in_5G_wireless_sensor_network.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "role user (U, S: agent, Kus, SKij: symmetric_key, Ks: public_key, H, H1, H2, H6, H7, H14, H16: hash_func, SND, RCV: channel (dy))\nplayed_by U def=\n\n  local State: nat,\n        IDi, IDinew, IDj, Nj, PWi, Bi, E, Ej, Xj, V, N, N1, BBi, W, Yij, Tu, Ts, T1, T2, A, As, B, Bs, SKijNew: text, K, Q, Ay, By: message\n\n  init State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n% Registration phase: The user starts the registration process by creating and sending necessary credentials.\n\t1.

Below is a brief description of each phase and the protocol's structure that you can use to reconstruct the HLPSL file:\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nThis protocol involves interactions between two main roles: a user and a server. The protocol supports three main phases: registration, login and initial authentication, and fast authentication. It uses symmetric and asymmetric cryptography to secure communications and authenticates entities. \n\n### Roles and Variables\n\n#### User Role\n- **Participants**: User (U), Server (S).\n- **Cryptographic Parameters**: \n  - `Kus` and `SKij`: symmetric keys for encryption and key agreement.\n  - `Ks`: public key of the server.\n  - `H`, `H1`, `H2`, `H6`, `H7`, `H14`, `H16`: hash functions used for various cryptographic computations.\n- **Channels**: `SND` for sending messages, `RCV` for receiving messages through Dolev-Yao model channels.\n\n#### Server Role\n- Similar to the User role, but played by the Server (S).\n- Maintains states and performs cryptographic checks and operations based on messages received from User.\n\n### Phases\n\n#### Registration Phase\n1. **User initiates registration** with an initial set of credentials. The user computes a hashed value `W'` using personal identifiers and sends it to the server.\n2. **Server processes the registration request**, constructing a message with user credentials partially encrypted, and responds to the user with a new session identifier and other cryptographic information.\n\n#### Login and Initial Authentication\n1. **User initiates login**, computes various hash values including `W'` for identity confirmation, and sends a request to the server.\n2. **Server verifies the request**, checks the integrity and authenticity of the message, computes response credentials including new session keys, and responds back.\n\n#### Fast Authentication Phase\n1. **User performs fast re-authentication** by sending a pre-computed hash `Ay'` to the server.\n2. **Server confirms user identity**, marks successful authentication, and sends back confirmation.\n\n### Security Goals\n\n- **Secrecy**: Ensure that sensitive data (`g1`, `g2`, `g3`, `g4`, `g5`, `g6`, `g7`) is kept confidential.\n- **Authentication**: Ensure the integrity and identity of the parties through authentication on `u_s_v`, `u_s_tu`, and `s_u_ts`.\n\n### Environment\nThe environment role simulates the presence of an intruder with initial knowledge of public keys and certain agents, facilitating analysis of conceivable security breaches through compromised sessions.\n\n### Sessions\nThe protocol instantiates several sessions to evaluate interactions between honest and dishonest entities, with the intruder attempting to engage using known symmetric keys, simulating realistic attack scenarios.\n\n### Summary\nThis protocol is designed to securely authenticate a user to a server using strong cryptographic primitives and mutual authentication phases. With confidentiality and authentication goals explicitly stated, the protocol is robust against various attack vectors, making use of symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic techniques.\n\nBy following this description, you should be able to reconstruct the HLPSL file by defining roles, transitions, and goals as specified, paying particular attention to the hash functions and key exchanges used throughout the protocol."]]}, "HLPSL-1/SPEKE.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL*: SPEKE\n%% VARIANT: SPEKE (with strong password-only authentication)\n%% PURPOSE: Strong Password-Only Authenticated Key Exchange\n%% REFERENCE:\n%% \\url{http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/jablon96strong.html}\n%% MODELER:\n%% \\begin{itemize}\n%%  \\item Haykal Tej, Siemens CT IC 3, 2003\n%%  \\item Sebastian M{\\\"o}dersheim, ETH Z{\\\"u}rich, December 2003\n%% \\end{itemize}\n%%\n%% ALICE_BOB:\n%% \\begin{verbatim}\n%% A -> B : exp(S(A,B), Na)     |    key exchange part\n%% B -> A : exp(S(A,B), Nb)     |\n%%\n%%               both A and B compute\n%%               K = exp(exp(S(A,B),Na), Nb) = exp(exp(S(A,B),Nb), Na)\n%%\n%% A -> B : {Ca}_K              |\n%% B -> A : {Cb,Ca}_K           |    challenge/response\n%% A -> B : {Cb}_K              |    authentication part\n%%\n%% S(A,B): password (shared key)\n%% \\end{verbatim}\n%%\n%% LIMITATIONS: None\n%%\n%% PROBLEMS: 3\n%%\n%% CLASSIFICATION: G2 G12\n%%\n%% ATTACKS: None\n%% NOTES: None\n%%\t\n%%HLPSL:\n%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\nrole speke_Init (A,B: agent,\n                 Kab: symmetric_key,\n                 Snd,Rcv: channel(dy))\nplayed_by A\ndef=\n                 \n  local  State: nat,\n         Na,Ca: text,\n         Cb   : text,\n         X,K  : message\n\n  const  sec_i_Ca, sec_i_Cb : protocol_id\n\n  init   State := 0\n\n  transition\n\n   1.

This protocol is designed for a strong, password-only authenticated key exchange between two parties, commonly referred to in protocol analysis as Alice (A) and Bob (B). Below is a description of the protocol based on the HLPSL code provided:\n\n### Protocol Description: SPEKE\n\n**Purpose**: The SPEKE protocol is implemented to achieve a robust password-only authenticated key exchange mechanism. Its primary aim is to ensure secure, mutual authentication and confidentiality between two parties using a shared password.\n\n**Participants**:\n- **Alice (A)**: An agent initiating the key exchange.\n- **Bob (B)**: An agent responding to the key exchange initiation.\n\n**Shared Information**:\n- **S(A,B)**: A predefined password known only to both Alice and Bob.\n- **Kab**: The symmetric key derived during the protocol execution.\n\n**Protocol Overview**:\n1. **Key Exchange Initialization**:\n   - Alice initiates the protocol by generating a random nonce, `Na`, and sending the exponential result `exp(S(A,B), Na)` to Bob.\n   - Bob, upon receiving this message, generates his own random nonce, `Nb`, and responds by sending `exp(S(A,B), Nb)` to Alice.\n\n2. **Shared Key Computation**:\n   - Both Alice and Bob compute the shared secret key, `K`, using their own nonce and the received exponential value.\n   - The computation verifies as \\( K = exp(exp(S(A,B), Na), Nb) = exp(exp(S(A,B), Nb), Na) \\).\n\n3. **Challenge-Response Authentication**:\n   - Alice sends an encrypted challenge `{Ca}_K` to Bob.\n   - To authenticate himself and verify Alice's challenge, Bob sends back a composite message `{Cb, Ca}_K`.\n   - Alice responds with `{Cb}_K` to confirm Bob's challenge, completing the mutual authentication process.\n\n**Channel Assumptions**:\n- All communications occur over a Dolev-Yao channel, which models potential eavesdropping and interception by an intruder.\n\n**Security Goals**:\n- **Confidentiality**: Both challenges `Ca` and `Cb` are to be kept secret from external entities. This is modeled as `secrecy_of sec_i_Ca, sec_i_Cb, sec_r_Ca, sec_r_Cb`.\n- **Authentication**:\n  - **G2 Goal**: Ensures that Alice and Bob can mutually authenticate each other by verifying the integrity of messages `ca` and `cb`.\n  - `authentication_on ca`: SPEKE_Init authenticates SPEKE_Resp.\n  - `authentication_on cb`: SPEKE_Resp authenticates SPEKE_Init.\n\n**Environment and Attack Model**:\n- The environment consists of:\n  - Two direct sessions between Alice and Bob.\n  - Sessions involving an intruder, simulating potential man-in-the-middle attacks.\n- The initial intruder knowledge includes public identifiers like agent names and keys `kai` and `kbi` meant for the intruder's simulated sessions with Alice and Bob.\n\nThis protocol as modeled in HLPSL ensures secure key exchange and mutual authentication under the Dolev-Yao intruder model, thereby validating its core objective of providing strong password-only authentication."]]}, "HLPSL-1/ISO2.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL*: ISO2 Public Key Unilateral Authentication Protocol\n%% VARIANT: two-pass unilateral authentication\n%% PURPOSE: Authentication of a client to a server.

This description provides an overview of the protocol, its objectives, and the roles involved. It would help anyone understand the protocol and potentially recreate the corresponding HLPSL file for analysis with AVISPA.\n\n---\n\n### Protocol Overview\n\nThe ISO2 Public Key Unilateral Authentication Protocol is designed to enable a client (denoted as agent A) to authenticate itself to a server (denoted as agent B) using a two-pass process, which is a variant of unilateral authentication. The server initiates the session and seeks to verify the identity of the client through the exchange of cryptographic messages.\n\n### Protocol Purpose\n\nThe primary goal of this protocol is the secure authentication of the client to the server. In this specific model, the server starts the session and the client responds by sending a digitally signed message.\n\n### Key Features\n\n- **Initiation**: The protocol session is initiated by the server, which sends a nonce and some text to the client.\n  \n- **Client Response**: The client replies with its certificate, a nonce to ensure freshness, and a digital signature to confirm its identity to the server.\n\n### Roles\n\n#### 1. **iso2_Init (Initiator - Server B)**\n\n- **Participants**: B (Server), A (Client), Pks (Server's Public Key)\n- **Channels**: Snd (Send Channel), Rec (Receive Channel)\n- **States**: \n  - State 0: Awaiting start signal, generates a nonce (Rb) and sends it along with some text to A.\n  - State 1: Receives a message from A containing the client\u2019s public key, certificate, and signed data. Validates the received nonce and requests authentication confirmation.\n\n#### 2. **iso2_Resp (Responder - Client A)**\n\n- **Participants**: A (Client), B (Server), Pka (Client's Public Key), Pks (Server's Public Key)\n- **Channels**: Snd (Send Channel), Rec (Receive Channel)\n- **States**: \n  - State 0: Waits for the server's initial message, receives the nonce, and generates its own nonce (Ra).\n  - State 2: Sends its public key, a signed message including both nonces, and identifies to the server to confirm its identity.\n\n### Session Role\n\nThis role combines both the initiator and responder in a session by defining how both roles interact using specified communication channels.\n\n### Environment Role\n\nThe environment role sets up the protocol simulation context, including:\n- Constants such as the protocol identifier, text elements, and agent names.\n- The public keys and the intruder's knowledge, which includes the ability to intercept messages or impersonate a participant within the limits defined.\n\n### Goals\n\nThe primary security goal is authentication:\n- **Authentication on `ra`**: Ensures that the initiator (B) correctly authenticates the responder (A) on the protocol's variable `ra`. This addresses specific classified goals such as G1 and G2.\n\n### Known Issues and Assumptions\n\n- The protocol makes the assumption that the server possesses the private key corresponding to the public key used to verify the client's certificate.\n- No known attacks are highlighted for this variant of the protocol.\n\nBy understanding these elements, a user can reconstruct the HLPSL specification and evaluate the security properties using tools like AVISPA to perform automated protocol analysis."]]}, "HLPSL-1/Kerberos.hlpsl": {"code": [[true, "%% PROTOCOL: Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)\n%% VARIANT: basic (core)\n%% PURPOSE: Authentication, Authorisation, Key Exchange\n%%\n%% Kerberos is a distributed authentication service that allows a process\n%% (a client) running on behalf of a principal (a user) to prove its identity\n%% to a verifier (an application server, or just server) without sending data\n%% across the network that might allow an attacker or the verifier to\n%% subsequently impersonate the principal.

They do not change the protocol's operation and should help both maintainers and users understand the specification."]], "logic": [[true, "### Protocol Description: Kerberos Network Authentication Service (V5)\n\n#### Protocol Overview:\n- **Purpose:** The Kerberos protocol is designed to provide secure authentication and authorization in distributed environments, ensuring that clients can prove their identity to servers without exposing sensitive information.\n- **Key Exchange:** The protocol facilitates secure key exchanges, enabling encrypted and tamper-proof communication channels.\n\n#### Roles and Entities:\n1. **Client (C):** The entity requiring authentication to access a service provided by the Server.\n2. **Authentication Server (A):** Validates the client's credentials and issues a ticket to the Ticket Granting Server (TGS).\n3. **Ticket Granting Server (G):** Issues service tickets allowing the client to access the specific server.\n4. **Server (S):** The service provider requiring client authentication.\n\n#### Keys and Cryptographic Material:\n- **K_AB:** Symmetric key shared or intended to be shared between entities A and B.\n- **Pre-shared Keys:** K_CA (between C and A), K_AG (between A and G), K_GS (between G and S).\n- **Session Keys:** K_CG (between C and G) and K_CS (between C and S), established during the protocol execution.\n\n#### Protocol Flow:\n1. **Initial Request to AS:**\n   - C -> A: C sends a request to A with its identity, the intended service (G), a lifetime for the ticket, and a nonce (N1).\n\n2. **AS Issues Ticket for TGS:**\n   - A -> C: A responds with a ticket meant for G (Ticket_1) and session key K_CG, both encrypted with K_CA.\n\n3. **Request to TGS:**\n   - C -> G: C requests access to a specific server S by sending the ticket for G along with a timestamp encrypted using K_CG and a new nonce (N2).\n\n4. **TGS Issues Service Ticket:**\n   - G -> C: G sends a service ticket for S (Ticket_2), and the session key K_CS, encrypted with K_CG.\n\n5. **Accessing the Server:**\n   - C -> S: C presents the service ticket to S and a timestamp encrypted with K_CS.\n   - S -> C: S acknowledges by returning a time-stamped message encrypted with K_CS to verify its authenticity.\n\n#### Protocol Properties:\n- *Authentication:* Ensures mutual authentication between clients and servers.\n- *Confidentiality and Integrity:* The protocol leverages symmetric keys, ensuring that messages are encrypted and remain tamper-proof.\n- *Weak Authentication:* The protocol specifies weak authentication attributes, confirming message receipt without verifying every step or aspect.\n\n#### Security Goals:\n- **Secrecy of Session Keys:** Ensure that keys such as K_CG and K_CS remain confidential and are not exposed to potential attackers.\n- **Authentication Validity:** The protocol weakly authenticates different role interactions, confirming that expected messages are received in the intended order.\n\n#### Limitations:\n- **Ticket Caching:** The protocol does not include ticket caching mechanisms, which means authentication may be less robust compared to implementations that utilize caching.\n\n#### Environmental Considerations:\n- The environment models interactions with both a legitimate client and potential adversary ('i'), ensuring robustness against intruder attacks.\n\n#### References and Modelling Contribution:\n- The protocol is based on current standards including contributions from Haykal Tej and Sebastian M\u00f6dersheim and maintained by the AVISPA team, reflecting the best practices of modelling Kerberos using high-level security protocol languages (HLPSL).\n\nBy maintaining the secrecy of symmetric keys and ensuring weak authentication between entities, the Kerberos protocol secures client-server communications effectively within distributed systems."]]}}
