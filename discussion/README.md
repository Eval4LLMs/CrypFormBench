## Adaptive Call Commands

Currently, call commands for protocol verification tools are fixed and must be crafted manually. We envision future systems where LLMs autonomously synthesize tool-specific commands from protocol logic and targeted properties. This is especially important for non-standard adversary settings (e.g., Diffie–Hellman with key-compromise impersonation or weak perfect forward secrecy), where default settings are insufficient. Automated command synthesis could thus extend the usability of formal tools to more customized scenarios.
